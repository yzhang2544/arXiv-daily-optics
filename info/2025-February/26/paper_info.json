    "abstract": "           A novel theoretical reformulation of the conventional three-step photoemission model is presented by integrating the conceptual frameworks of constructor theory and quantum information theory. Each step of the photoemission process photon absorption, electron transport, and electron emission is formalized as a physical task (in the constructor-theoretic sense) and modeled by a quantum channel with an explicit operator-level description. This dual framework not only recovers the standard efficiency factorization n = A T D but also reveals new insights into the preservation of coherence and the interdependence of successive tasks. Furthermore, potential experimental setups and conditions under which the predicted phenomena could be observed are discussed. The motivation of this work is to pave the path for improved implementations of the current photoemission model and to contribute toward the realization of a universal constructor for quantum computation.

    "abstract": "           In this study, we present a method to create a robust inverse surrogate model for a soft X-ray spectrometer. During a beamtime at an electron storage ring, such as BESSY II, instrumentation and beamlines are required to be correctly aligned and calibrated for optimal experimental conditions. In order to automate these processes, machine learning methods can be developed and implemented, but in many cases these methods require the use of an inverse model which maps the output of the experiment, such as a detector image, to the parameters of the device. Due to limited experimental data, such models are often trained with simulated data, which creates the challenge of compensating for the inherent differences between simulation and experiment. In order to close this gap, we demonstrate the application of data augmentation and adversarial domain adaptation techniques, with which we can predict absolute coordinates for the automated alignment of our spectrometer. Bridging the simulation-experiment gap with minimal real-world data opens new avenues for automated experimentation using machine learning in scientific instrumentation.         ",

We overcome these limitations by embedding Mie resonators within ENZ media, thereby enhancing Q- factors, mitigating geometric dispersion and fabrication challenges, and maximizing optical reconfigurability.

To address this, ByteQC, a fully-functional and efficient package for large-scale quantum chemistry simulations, has been open-sourced at this https URL, leveraging recent advances in computational power and many-body algorithms. Regarding computational power, several standard algorithms are efficiently implemented on modern GPUs, ranging from mean-field calculations (Hartree-Fock and density functional theory) to post-Hartree-Fock methods such as M\u00f8ller-Plesset perturbation theory, random phase approximation, coupled cluster methods, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. For the algorithmic approach, we also employ a quantum embedding method, which significantly expands the tractable system size while preserving high accuracy at the gold-standard level. All these features have been systematically benchmarked. For standalone algorithms, the benchmark results demonstrate up to a 60$\\times$ speedup when compared to 100-core CPUs. Additionally, the tractable system sizes have been significantly expanded: 1,610 orbitals for coupled cluster with single and double excitations (1,380 orbitals with perturbative triple excitations), 11,040 orbitals for M\u00f8ller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order, 37,120 orbitals for mean-field calculations under open boundary conditions, and over 100,000 orbitals for periodic boundary conditions.

Describing the fluid field via the wave function offers distinct advantages in capturing complex structures, topological properties, and fluid dynamics, while opening new avenues for innovative solutions through quantum computing platforms. The representation is reformulated into an eigenvalue problem for Hermitian matrices, enabling the conversion of velocity fields into complex scalar fields that embed the vortex filaments. The resulting optimization is addressed using a variational quantum eigensolver, with Pauli operator truncation and deep learning techniques applied to improve efficiency and reduce noise. The proposed quantum framework achieves a near-linear time complexity and a exponential storage reduction while maintaining a balance of accuracy, robustness, and versatility, presenting a promising tool for turbulence analysis, vortex dynamics research, and machine learning dataset generation.

The quantum treatment of the proton wave packet shows a counter-intuitive kinetic isotope effect, with strong isotope dependence for the barrierless potential surface of HBQ and no isotope effect in the double-well energy landscape of the HBT, in accordance with experimental results. Strikingly, for HBQ we find that changing laser pulse durations can even reverse the isotope effect on the proton transfer rate, revealing the role of vibration-assisted absorption in ESIPT. This study highlights the often neglected effect of excitation conditions on ESIPT, as well as the role of entangled, vibrationally assisted absorption processes that can be directly visualised in our multidimensional treatment of the full electro-vibronic-environment wave function.

    "abstract": "           Extensive monitoring of acoustic activities is important for many fields, including biology, security, oceanography, and Earth science. Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is an evolving technique for continuous, wide-coverage measurements of mechanical vibrations, which is suited to ocean applications. DAS illuminates an optical fiber with laser pulses and measures the backscattered wave due to small random variations in the refractive index of the material. Specifically, DAS uses coherent optical interferometry to measure the phase difference of the backscattered wave from adjacent locations along the fiber. External stimuli, such as mechanical strain due to acoustic wavefields impinging on the fiber-optic cable, modulate the backscattered wave. Hence, the differential phase measurements of the optical backscatter are proportional to the underlying physical quantities of the surrounding wavefield. Continuous measurement of the backscattered electromagnetic signal provides a distributed sensing modality that extends spatially along the fiber. We provide an overview of DAS technology and detail the underlying physics, from electromagnetic to mechanical and eventually acoustic quantities.

    "abstract": "           Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) has opened a new frontier in quantum optics, which enables the radiative coupling of distantly located emitters via the spatially extended waveguide mode. This coupling leads to modified emission dynamics and previous work has reported the observation of increased intensity correlations (an antidip) when probing the resonance response of multiple emitters. However, the interference between independent emitters has been shown to lead to a similar response. Here, we directly observe resonant energy transfer between two distant quantum emitters by recording an antidip in the intensity correlations, $g^{(2)}(\\tau)$, while driving only one of the emitters. Under the condition that only a single emitter is driven, the antidip in photon coincidences is a distinctive signature of emitter-emitter coupling, which enables the transfer of energy from the driven to the undriven emitter. Interestingly, the observed mechanism is a long-range and waveguide-engineered resonant version of resonant F\u00f6rster transfer, which is responsible for the transport of energy between chlorophylls in the photosynthesis. Building on the established coupling, we demonstrate collective driving of the coupled emitter pair. Specifically, we control the relative driving phase and amplitude of the emitters and apply this collective excitation scheme to selectively populate the long-lived subradiant state. This results in suppressed emission, i.e. the peculiar situation where driving two emitters as opposed to one effectively reduces the probability of photon emission. Our work presents novel emission regimes and excitation schemes for a multi-emitter waveguide QED system. These can be exploited to deterministically generate emitter-emitter entanglement and advanced photonic states providing robustness against losses for photonic quantum computation and quantum communication.

Although this process has been used to model the initial steps for formation of PAHs, it has not been experimentally measured. To explore this reaction mechanism, we have carried out the first experimental study of sequential ion-molecule reactions beginning with protonation of acetylene at single-collision conditions.

Yet many materials optimized for room-temperature operation see their Pockels coefficients at cryogenic temperatures significantly reduced - a major hurdle for emerging quantum technologies which have even more rigorous demands than their classical counterpart. A noted example is $\\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$, which features the strongest effective Pockels coefficient at room temperature, only to see it reduced to a third (i.e. $\\mathrm{r_{eff}} \\approx$ 170 pm/V) at a few Kelvin.

By adjusting the stoichiometry, we can increase the Curie temperature and realise a ferroelectric phase that yields a high Pockels coefficient, yet with limited optical losses - on the order of decibels per centimetre.

    "title": "Spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton",
    "abstract": "           We confirm the existence of the spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton and the value of its tOAM, verifying our theory of transverse orbital angular momentum in a simple dispersive medium [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)]. We also develop a physical picture of the polariton as a structure driven by torques induced by the ponderomotive force of the light in the presence of material dispersion. This is a new type of spatiotemporal torque unanticipated in our recent work [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 011031 (2024)]. These results are accomplished by high resolution particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of STOV pulse reflection from and transmission through a fully ionized hydrogen plasma slab. The linear theory matches the PIC simulations up to near-critical plasma densities and near-relativistic field strengths. For higher intensities, optical tOAM becomes invested in collective modes of the plasma.         ",

    "abstract": "           The static and dynamic properties of a cyclic Rouse chain modified by the introduction of an effective, spherically symmetric, attracting potential of entropic nature is studied. It is shown that a relatively weak potential can lead to a strong contraction of the polymer chain: the radius of gyration becomes much smaller compared to the size of free cyclic chain. The pronounced decrease in the terminal relaxation time of cyclic macromolecules compared to the Rouse relaxation time leads to a lengthening of the time interval for the transition to the normal, i.e. the Fickian, diffusion regime, generating a pseudo-plateau at increasing molecular mass for the time dependence of segmental mean squared segmental displacement.
