    "title": "Temperature Dependence of Beam on Plasma Stopping Power in the Resonance Regions of Fusion Reactions",
    "abstract": "           A recent proposal of accelerator based fusion reactor considers a scheme where an ion beam from the accelerator hits the target plasma on the resonance of the fusion reaction so that the reactivity ($\\sigma v$) can be an order of magnitude larger than that of a thermonuclear reactor. One of the important inputs is the stopping power which is needed to assess the energy loss of the beam in the plasma. In this work, we shall use the analytic formulation of Brown, Preston and Singleton~\\cite{Brown:2005ji} to calculate the temperature dependence of the stopping power due to the target $t, {}^3H_e$, and ${}^{11}B$ plasmas in the resonance regions of their respective fusion reactions, i.e., $ d + t \\rightarrow n + \\alpha, d + {}^3H_e \\rightarrow p + \\alpha$, and $p + {}^{11}B \\rightarrow 3 \\alpha$. It is found that the calculated stopping power, especially when the quantum corrections are included, does not go down with temperature as fast at $T^{-3/2}$. Instead it decreases slower, more like $T^{-x}$ with $x \\le 1$ in the range of T from $\\sim$ 5 to 50 keV for $d$ on $t$ and ${}^3H_e$ plasmas around their resonance energies.         ",

This study introduces a novel framework for understanding these nonlinear effects by incorporating gauge-covariant formulations based on phase space Lie algebras. By analyzing the evolution of density matrices under phase space displacements, we derive constrained expressions for nonlinear polarization and susceptibility tensors. The implications of geometric phases, such as Berry curvature, are explored, demonstrating their role in suppressing unphysical components of the polarization. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the theoretical predictions, offering insights into nonlinear rectification and topological Hall effects. This approach opens avenues for engineering materials with tailored nonlinear properties, particularly in the realm of metamaterials and topological photonics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Cone tip resistance and excess water pressure (EWP) measured by piezocone penetration tests (CPTU) may be significantly affected by the partially drained effect in soils with intermediate permeability. To capture this effect, the paper proposes a straightforward, hydro-mechanical coupling solution for cylindrical cavity expansion under partially drained conditions. The mechanical behaviour of soils is modelled using the elastoplastic Tresca model and water flow within porous soils is assumed to obey Darcys law. Two partial differential equations (PDEs) are established in the elastic and plastic zones, respectively, transforming the cavity expansion analysis into a typical Stefan problem with dynamic boundary conditions (i.e. a moving boundary at the elastoplastic interface). An approximate solution for the PDEs is derived by leveraging the variable transformation method. Based on the new solution, a novel normalised penetration rate is defined considering the rigidity index of soils, with which a unique backbone curve for CPTU is found. Finally, the backbone curve is compared with a database comprising 109 in-situ experimental tests, 101 centrifuge modelling tests, and numerical simulation results. The proposed solution may provide a useful theoretical tool for interpreting the consolidation coefficient of fine-grained soils from the penetration stage of multi-rate CPTU, which can enhance the interpretation reliability for CPTU dissipation tests.

    "abstract": "           Current-biased Josephson junctions (CBJJs) have been demonstrated as sensitive Josephson threshold detectors (JTDs) in the infrared range. In this letter, we show this kind of detector could also be used to detect broadband microwave photons. Based on the numerical simulations of the noise-driving phase dynamics of an underdamped Josephson junction, driven by the low-frequency triangular wave current, we argue that the microwave photons flowing across the JJ can be detected by probing the voltage switched signals of the JJ. Experimentally, we designed and fabricated the relevant Al/AlOx/Al Josephson device and measured its response to microwave photons at 50~mK temperature. Experimental results indicate that the weak microwave signals could be threatened as the additional noises modify the phase dynamics of the CBJJ, which could thus be detected by the generated JTD. The detection sensitivity is characterized by using the Kumar-Caroll index to differentiate the junction switched duration distributions, with and without microwave signal input. Although the demonstrated detection sensitivity is just $-92$~dBm (corresponding to approximately 30~photon/ns) for the microwave photons at $\\sim 5$GHz (which is manifestly deviated from the plasma frequency of the fabricated JJ), we argued, based on the relevant numerical simulations, that the generated JTD could be used to achieve the sensitive detection of the microwave photons at the plasma frequency of the JJ.

    "abstract": "           Materials which exhibit the Pockels effect are notable for their strong electro-optic interaction and rapid response times and are therefore used extensively in classical electro-optic components for data and telecommunication applications. Yet many materials optimized for room-temperature operation see their Pockels coefficients at cryogenic temperatures significantly reduced - a major hurdle for emerging quantum technologies which have even more rigorous demands than their classical counterpart. A noted example is $\\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$, which features the strongest effective Pockels coefficient at room temperature, only to see it reduced to a third (i.e. $\\mathrm{r_{eff}} \\approx$ 170 pm/V) at a few Kelvin. Here, we show that this behaviour is not inherent and can even be reversed: Strontium titanate ($\\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$), a material normally not featuring a Pockels coefficient, can be engineered to exhibit an $\\mathrm{r_{eff}}$ of 345 pm/V at cryogenic temperatures - a record value in any thin-film electro-optic material. By adjusting the stoichiometry, we can increase the Curie temperature and realise a ferroelectric phase that yields a high Pockels coefficient, yet with limited optical losses - on the order of decibels per centimetre. Our findings position $\\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ as one of the most promising materials for cryogenic quantum photonics applications.         ",

We show how a parsimonious Langevin model can be constructed from experimental data, resulting in a mathematical description that encompasses both the deterministic and stochastic properties of the evolution of the soliton molecules. In particular, we were able to probe the response dynamics of the soliton molecule to an external kick in a sub-critical approach, namely without the need to actually disturb the systems under investigation. Moreover, the noise experienced by the dissipative solitonic system, including its distribution and correlation, can now be also analyzed in details.

    "abstract": "           Remote magnetic sensing can be used to monitor the position of objects in real-time, enabling ground transport monitoring, underground infrastructure mapping and hazardous detection. However, magnetic signals are typically weak and complex, requiring sophisticated physical models to analyze them and a detailed knowledge of the system under study, factors that are frequently unavailable. In this work, we provide a solution to these limitations by demonstrating a Machine Learning (ML) method that can be trained exclusively on experimental data, without the need of any physical model, to predict the position of a magnetic target in real-time. The target can be any object with a magnetic signal above the floor noise, and in this case we use a quantum diamond magnetometer to track variations of few hundreds of nanoteslas produced by an elevator moving along a single axis. The one-dimensional movement is a simple yet challenging scenario, resembling realistic environments such as high buildings, tunnels or train circuits, and is the first step towards building broader applications. Our ML algorithm can be trained in approximately 40 min, achieving over 80% accuracy in predicting the target's position at a rate of 10 Hz, for a positional error tolerance of 30 cm, which is a precise distance compared to the 4-meter spacing between parking levels. Our results open up the possibility to apply this ML method more generally for real-time monitoring of magnetic objects, which will broaden the scope of magnetic detection applications.         ",

The innovative application of fiber sensors allows for spatially resolved temperature measurement, particularly emphasizing the importance of monitoring not just the exterior but also the internal conditions within battery cells. Utilizing inert glass fibers as sensors, which exhibit minimal sensitivity to electric fields, opens up new pathways for their implementation in a wide range of applications, such as battery monitoring. The sensors used in this work provide real-time information along the entire length of the fiber, unlike commonly used Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. It is shown that using the herein presented novel sensors in a temperature range of 0 to 80 degree celsius reveals a linear thermal dependency with high sensitivity and a local resolution of a few centimeters. Furthermore, this study presents preliminary findings on the potential application of fiber optic sensors in lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells, demonstrating that the steps required for battery integration do not impose any restrictive effects on thermal measurements.

For the case of tweezer-trapped neutral atoms, our results indicate that operating in the bad-cavity regime with cavity decay rate exceeding atom-photon coupling rate, and near-ground-state cooling with motional quanta below 1, are desired to suppress the motion-induced infidelity sufficiently below the 1\\% level required for efficient quantum networking.

We also expect that quantum ratchet works in quantum photosynthesis, where possible role of quantum effects is now widely discussed but the underlying dynamical processes are still not clearly known. In this work, we study a model of amplification of quantum transfer and making it directed which we call the quantum ratchet model. The model is based on a special quantum control master equation with dynamics induced by a feedback-type process. The ratchet effect is achieved in the quantum control model with dissipation and sink, where the Hamiltonian depends on vibrations in the energy difference synchronized with transitions between energy levels. A similarity between this model and the model of coherent transport in quantum photosynthesis, where the time dependence of the Hamiltonian arises due to vibrons, is studied. Amplitude and frequency of the oscillating vibron together with the dephasing rate are the parameters of the quantum ratchet which determine its efficiency. We study with which parameters the quantum ratchet minimizes the exction recombination time and show that the experimentally known values of the parameters of the photosynthetic reaction center correspond to values of the parameters of the quantum ratchet which realize a local minimum of the exciton recombination time. We also find another values of the parameters of the quantum ratchet minimizing the exciton recombination time, which corresponds to a twice smaller frequency of the vibron compared to that observed in experiments.

Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle involves a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. This is done with a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free-fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.         ",

Here, we report the difference frequency conversion of $637.2$ nm fluorescent light from a cluster of NV centers in diamond to tunable wavelengths between $1559.6$ nm and $1565.2$ nm. In order to avoid detrimental noise from spontaneous emissions, we use a two-step conversion device based on a single-pumped periodic poled lithium niobate waveguide. We observed a total external (internal) conversion efficiency of $3.0\\pm0.1$ ($20.5\\pm0.8$) $\\%$ with a noise rate of $2.4\\pm0.8$ ($16\\pm5$) cps/GHz.         ",

    "abstract": "           High-purity multi-photon states are essential for photonic quantum computing. Among existing platforms, semiconductor quantum dots offer a promising route to scalable and deterministic multi-photon state generation. However, to fully realize their potential we require a suitable optical excitation method. Current approaches of multi-photon generation rely on active polarization-switching elements (e.g., electro-optic modulators, EOMs) to spatio-temporally demultiplex single photons. Yet, the achievable multi-photon rate is fundamentally limited by the switching speed of the EOM. Here, we introduce a fully passive demultiplexing technique that leverages a stimulated two-photon excitation process to achieve switching rates that are only limited by the quantum dot lifetime. We demonstrate this method by generating two-photon states from a single quantum dot without requiring any active switching elements. Our approach significantly reduces the cost of demultiplexing while shifting it to the excitation stage, enabling loss-free demultiplexing and effectively doubling the achievable multi-photon generation rate when combined with existing active demultiplexing techniques.

    "abstract": "           Global sensing enables parameter estimation across arbitrary parameter ranges with a finite number of shots. While various formulations exist, the Bayesian paradigm offers a flexible approach to optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. However, there are several sets of assumptions capturing the notions of prior ignorance and uninformed estimation, leading to two main approaches: invariance of the prior distribution under specific parameter transformations, and adherence to the geometry of a state space. While the first approach often leads to simpler priors and estimators and is more broadly applicable in adaptive settings, the second can lead to faster posterior convergence in a well-defined measurement setting. We examine the practical consequences of both approaches and show how to apply them in examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy scenarios. More importantly, by employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we unify the two approaches into a practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed - a blueprint for the design of quantum sensors.

    "abstract": "           Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.

In this paper, we demonstrate the integration of centimetre-long thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) devices on a SiN platform using the micro-transfer printing (uTP) method. At a wavelength of 1550 nm, propagation losses of approximately 0.9 dB/cm and transition losses of 1.8 dB per facet were measured. Furthermore, the TFLN was integrated into an imbalanced push-pull Mach-Zehnder modulator, achieving a V{\\pi} of 3.2 V. The electro-optics nature of the observed modulation is confirmed by measuring the device up to 35 GHz, showing that the printing does not affect the high-speed LN properties.         ",

Here, we present algorithms for solving time-dependent PDEs, with particular reference to fluid equations. We build on an idea based on linear combination of unitaries to simulate non-unitary, non-Hermitian quantum systems, and generate hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that efficiently perform iterative matrix-vector multiplication and matrix inversion operations. These algorithms are end-to-end, with relatively low-depth quantum circuits that demonstrate quantum advantage, with the best-case asymptotic complexities, which we show are near-optimal. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithms by conducting: (a) fully gate level, state-vector simulations using an in-house, high performance, quantum simulator called QFlowS; (b) experiments on a real quantum device; and (c) noisy simulations using Qiskit Aer. We also provide device specifications such as error-rates (noise) and state sampling (measurement) to accurately perform convergent flow simulations on noisy devices. The results offer evidence that the proposed algorithm is amenable for use on near-term quantum devices.         ",

    "abstract": "           Frequency domain sweeps of array antennas are well-known to be time-intensive, and different surrogate models have been used to improve the performance. Data-driven model order reduction algorithms, such as the Loewner framework and vector fitting, can be integrated with these adaptive error estimates, in an iterative algorithm, to reduce the number of full-wave simulations required to accurately capture the requested frequency behavior of multiport array antennas. In this work, we propose two novel adaptive methods exploiting a block matrix function which is a key part of the Loewner framework generating system approach. The first algorithm leverages an inherent matrix parameter freedom in the block matrix function to identify frequency points with large errors, whereas the second utilizes the condition number of the block matrix function. Both methods effectively provide frequency domain error estimates, which are essential for improved performance. Numerical experiments on multiport array antenna S-parameters demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms within the Loewner framework, where the proposed algorithms reach the smallest errors for the smallest number of frequency points chosen.
