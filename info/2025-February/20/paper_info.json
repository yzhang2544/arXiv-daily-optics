    "abstract": "           We report a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the instability achievable by using phase modulation spectroscopy to lock a terahertz local oscillator to an absorptive reference consisting of the rotational transition of molecules at room temperature. We find that the signal-to-noise ratio of the THz detector provides the limitation to the instability that can be achieved and analyze a number of viable candidate molecules, identifying several as being of particular interest, including OCS and HI. We find that a one-second instability in the $10^{-13}$ decade is achievable for molecules confined to waveguide, while instability at the $10^{-14}$ level can be reached for molecules in free space. We also present calculations of the intermodulation effect for spectroscopy taking place far outside the quasistatic regime and find that this source of noise presents constraints on which THz local oscillators are appropriate to be used for such frequency references.

    "abstract": "           In the laser welding and additive manufacturing (AM) communities, the balling defect is primarily attributed to the action of fluid instabilities with a few authors suggesting other mechanisms. Without commenting on the validity of the fluid instability driven \\textit{mechanism} of balling in AM, this work intends to present the most realistic analytical discussion of the balling defect driven purely by fluid instabilities. Synchrotron-based X-ray radiography of thin samples indicate that fluid instability growth rates and solidification can be comparable in magnitude and thus compete. Neglecting the action of fluid flows and heat transport, this work presents an analytical formalism which accounts for fluid instabilities and solidification competition, giving a continuous transition from balling to non-balling which is lacking in current literature. We adapt a Rivulet instability model from the fluid physics community to account for the stabilizing effects of the substrate which the Plateau-Rayleigh instability model does not account for, and estimate the instability growth rate. Our model predicts instability growth at higher wavelengths and shallower melt pool depths relative to width, as well as strong sensitivity to the solidification front curvature. Deviations between model predictions and our experimental results demonstrate the importance of fluid flows and heat transport in the balling process. Our experiments further demonstrate at least one mechanism by which the melt pool length and balling wavelength are not equivalent, as commonly claimed.         ",

Herein, hexagonal Cu$_2$Te microdisks are successfully prepared via chemical vapor deposition procedure using GaTe as Te source. The epitaxial growth mechanism of the Cu$_2$Te hexagonal structures with the orthorhombic phase are rationalized by proposed layer-over-layer growth model. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of Cu$_2$Te microdisks shows a new red emission band in addition to usual infrared light emission due to Cu deficiency. Single Cu$_2$Te microdisk operates as an optical microcavity supporting whispering gallery modes for red lasing around 627.5 nm. This Cu$_2$Te microdisk microcavity exhibits a high quality factor of 1568 and a low lasing threshold of 125 kW cm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. Meanwhile, Cu$_2$Te microdisks have been exhibited as an ideal platform for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) eliminating drawbacks of noble metal substrates with detection limitation to nanomolar level and an enhancement factor of $\\sim$1.95$\\times$10$^5$. Hexagonal Cu$_2$Te microdisks turn out to be an efficient microcavity for red lasing and low-cost nonmetallic SERS substrates, opening potential applications in photonics and biological detection of aromatic molecules.

In closed-loop time transfer over a 30-km dispersion-compensated fibre link with 300~fs of differential group delay, polarization interleaving reduced the delay variations to <20fs. The results indicate that the remaining drift is caused by polarization-dependent loss and by AM-to-PM noise conversion in the photodiodes, suggesting the need for a \"double-balanced\" phase detector in the receiver, that is, a phase detector balanced in power and polarization. By mitigating the polarization dependence, this work demonstrates a simple approach that can potentially yield sub-femtosecond-level, long-term time transfer in long-haul fibre links utilizing standard single-mode fibres.

The proposed mode mismatch sensing scheme uses an electro-optic lens (EOL) device that is designed to provide the required beam wavefront curvature actuation, as well as a mode converting telescope that rephases the RF second-order modes and generates a non-vanishing mode mismatch sensing signal. We carefully investigate the total second-order mode generation from the wavefront actuation both analytically and numerically, taking the effects of Gaussian beam size evolution and the second-order mode phase mismatch cancellation into consideration. We demonstrate the second-order mode generation as a function of the incident beam waist size and the electro-optic crystal size, which along with a ``trade-off'' consideration of the beam size at the edges of the crystal and the clipping loss, provides us with guidance for designing the beam profile that interacts with the crystal to improve the EOL modulation efficiency.

    "abstract": "           Unlike most commercially available silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), EQR20 SiPMs produced by the Novel Device Laboratory (NDL) avoid using individual resistors to quench the avalanche multiplication of the microcells. Instead, bulk resistance of the epitaxial silicon layer is used, and the signal is directly collected at a common anode plane. This allows for the fabrication of SiPMs as large as 6.2 x 6.2 mm^2 while keeping the recovery time below {\\tau} = 25 ns. These devices can be composed of microcells with 20-micrometer pitch while reaching PDE above 50% and 10^6 gain at 5 V overvoltage. On the other hand, a crosstalk level from 20% to 40% is observed for overvoltages from 3 V to 5 V. Moreover, significant pulse shape distortion is observed once the microcell occupancy exceeds a few percent. This work provides an independent determination of the performance parameters of the EQR20 11-6060D-S SiPMs and discusses the influence of the pulse shape distortion on the applicability of these devices in a scintillator-based calorimeter of a hadron collider experiment.

Here, we theoretically propose amplifying the magnetic-field signal by using nuclear spins by the quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Under identical conditions, we demonstrate that compared to the Markovian case the amplification of the weak magnetic field can be enhanced by a factor about $e^{1/2}$ under a Gaussian noise. Moreover, through numerical simulations we determine the optimal experimental parameters for amplification conditions. This work shows that the combination of the QZE and spin amplification effectively enhances the amplification of the weak magnetic field.

Taking advantage of the corresponding approximation recently developed by the authors for treating the classical dynamics in this setup, we solve the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations in the quasiclassical approximation in the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) framework. The obtained wave function for the Dirac equation shows entanglement between the kinetic momentum and spin of the electron, while the spin-averaged momentum coincides with the classical counterpart as expected.

This interface mode can be actively tuned via microelectromechanical systems or switched through the integration of phase-change materials. We further establish the feasibility of lasing action at this interface mode, offering a pathway toward topologically robust and reconfigurable lasers.

The map corresponds to a quantum walk of structured photons, realized through light propagation in three liquid-crystal metasurfaces, having their optic axes artificially patterned. Theoretically, the walk length and the number of connected modes can be arbitrary, while keeping losses constant. The patterns can be designed to replicate multiple unitary maps. We also discuss limited reconfigurability by adjusting the overall birefringence and the relative displacement of the optical elements.

To address this issue, we introduce a bypassing term that improves numerical stability by substantially reducing the condition number of the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, the small magnitude of the ionic flux \\( j \\) often leads to a common failure mode where PINNs converge to incorrect solutions. We demonstrate that incorporating a secondary conservation law for the solid-phase potential \\( \\psi \\) effectively prevents such convergence issues and ensures solution accuracy. The proposed methods prove effective for solving both forward and inverse problems involving the BV equation. Specifically, we achieve precise parameter estimation in inverse scenarios and reliable solution predictions for forward simulations.         ",

    "abstract": "           Few- and single-cycle optical pulses and their associated ultra-broadband spectra have been crucial in the progress of ultrafast science and technology. Moreover, multi-color waveforms composed of independently manipulable ultrashort pulses in distinct spectral bands offer unique advantages in pulse synthesis and attosecond science. However, the generation and control of ultrashort pulses has required bulky and expensive optical systems at the tabletop scale and has so far been beyond the reach of integrated photonics. Here, we break these limitations and demonstrate two-optical-cycle pulse compression using quadratic two-color soliton dynamics in lithium niobate nanophotonics. By leveraging dispersion engineering and operation near phase matching, we achieve extreme compression, energy-efficient operation, and strong conversion of pump to the second harmonic. We experimentally demonstrate generation of $\\sim$13-fs pulses at 2 $\\mu$m using only $\\sim$3 pJ of input energy. We further illustrate how the demonstrated scheme can be readily extended to on-chip single-cycle pulse synthesis with sub-cycle control. Our results provide a path towards realization of single-cycle ultrafast systems in nanophotonic circuits.         ",

    "abstract": "           Unpinned Dirac points (DPs) are nodal point degeneracies that occur at generic momentum points lacking high symmetry, often exhibiting characteristics typically forbidden by symmetry. While this phenomenon has been observed in solid-state materials, the formation of unpinned DPs in photonic crystals has not been extensively studied. This study presents a novel approach to achieving unpinned DPs in two-dimensional ``defected photonic crystals\"-photonic superlattices created by modifying the size or refractive index of dielectric disks at specific sites. The defected photonic crystal hosts multiple unpinned DPs through accidental band crossings induced by rotational symmetry breaking across the nodal line degeneracies prevalent in the superlattice. Furthermore, the number of unpinned DPs, along with their positions and anisotropic dispersions, can be manipulated by adjusting the size or refractive index of the dielectric disks. This study pioneers the exploration of defected photonic crystals, proposing them as effective means of achieving unpinned DPs and facilitating the investigation of novel relativistic photonic wave phenomena with significant flexibility and control.

    "title": "Performance Characteristics of the Battery-Operated Si PIN Diode Detector with Integrated Preamplifier and Data Acquisition Module for Fusion Particle Detection",
    "abstract": "           We present the performance and application of a commercial off-the shelf Si PIN diode (Hamamatsu S14605) as a charged particle detector in a compact ion beam system (IBS) capable of generating D-D and p-B fusion charged particles. This detector is inexpensive, widely available, and operates in photoconductive mode under a reverse bias voltage of 12 V, supplied by an A23 battery. A charge-sensitive preamplifier (CSP) is powered by two 3 V lithium batteries (A123), providing +/-3 V rail voltages. Both the detector and preamplifier circuits are integrated onto the same 4-layer PCB and housed on the vacuum side of the IBS, facing the fusion target. The system employs a CF-2.75 flanged DB-9 connector feedthrough to supply the signal, bias voltage, and rail voltages. To mitigate the high sensitivity of the detector to optical light, a thin aluminum foil assembly is used to block optical emissions from the ion beam and target. Charged particles generate step responses on the preamplifier output, with pulse rise times on the order of 0.2 to 0.3 us. These signals are recorded using a custom-built data acquisition unit, which features an optical fiber data link to ensure electrical isolation of the detector electronics. Subsequent digital signal processing is employed to optimally shape the pulses using a CR-RC^4 filter to produce Gaussian-shaped signals, enabling accurate extraction of energy information. Performance results show that the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) for D-D fusion charged particles - protons, tritons, and helions - are approximately 30, 10, and 5, respectively, with a shaping time constant of 4 us.

    "abstract": "           Phase-averaging is a fundamental approach for investigating periodic and non-stationary phenomena. In fluid dynamics, these can be generated by rotating blades such as propellers/turbines or by pulsed jets. Traditional phase-averaging approaches often rely on synchronized data acquisition systems, which might require high-speed cameras, light sources, and precise delay generators and encoders, making them expensive and sometimes unfeasible. This work proposes an a posteriori data-driven approach that reconstructs phase information from randomly acquired uncorrelated photographic frames (snapshots) using the ISOMAP algorithm. The technique enables accurate reordering of snapshots in the phase space and subsequent computation of the phase-averaged flow field without the need for synchronization. The framework was validated through numerical simulations and experimental fluid dynamics datasets from an optical setup featuring single- and multi-propeller configurations. The results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures the periodic flow characteristics while addressing the challenges related to synchronization and hardware limitations. Furthermore, the ability to apply this technique to archival datasets extends its applicability to a wide range of experimental fluid dynamics studies. This approach provides a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods for the analysis of periodic phenomena.         ",

    "abstract": "           This paper reports on an automated control strategy to set and stabilize a 2x2 integrated optical gate implemented with a balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The control strategy reliably configures the gate in any desired working point without any prior calibration or complex algorithm for the correction of hardware non-idealities. It has been tested on a multistage silicon photonic chip comprising a coherent input vector generator, the 2x2 gate used as matrix-vector multiplier and a coherent receiver for phase measurement. By leveraging the presence of transparent photodiodes in key positions, precise control of light beams in any point of the circuit is obtained, which translates into a resolution in the computation of the matrix-vector product of 7.2 and 8.5 bits for the output power and phase, respectively. High accuracy, robustness against non-idealities and stability over long-term operation, ensured by the feedback-controlled architecture, provide scalability towards optical processors of any size. Additionally, the possibility of using the MZI both as computing gate and phase validation unit avoids propagation of programming errors, solving a significant issue of coherent optical computing architectures.

Despite their favorable properties, much is still unknown about their characteristics and their atomic origin. We focus on two different kinds of hBN samples that particularly lend themselves for integration with nanophotonic devices, multilayer nanoflakes produced by liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) and a layer-engineered sample from hBN grown by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). We investigate their inherent defects and fit their emission properties to computationally simulated optical properties of likely carbon-related defects. Thereby we compare and elucidate the properties in different sample types particularly suited for photonic quantum networks and narrow down the origin of emitters found in these samples. Our work is thus an important step towards harnessing the full potential of single photon emitters in hBN.         ",
