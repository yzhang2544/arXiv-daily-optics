    "abstract": "           Detailed spectra of harmonics produced from ultra-intense, sub-picosecond, high-contrast laser pulses incident on solid targets have shown the first observation of regular red- and blue-shifted satellites. Their frequency shift is slightly less than the frequency of a nominal, pure ion-plasma wave associated with electron critical density, where an ion-acoustic wave would be expected. We explain this as the result of a substantial reduction of Debye shielding as the intense optical fields compete to drive electrons in large-amplitude oscillations. This general effect leads to a larger, dynamical and anisotropic Debye length, which should have a broad impact on plasma physics in this regime.         ",

While many approaches have been proposed, including in memory photonic circuits, most efforts have focused on the physical design of photonic components rather than full architectural integration with electronic peripheral circuitry. In this work, we present a microarchitecture level study that estimates the compute efficiency and density of three prominent photonic computing architectures. Our evaluation accounts for both the photonic circuits and the essential peripheral electronics required for optoelectronic and analog to digital conversions. We further demonstrate a heterogenous photonic electronic in memory processing approach for low latency neural network inference.

    "abstract": "           The hybrid light-matter character of exciton-polaritons gives rise to distinct polariton parametric scattering (PPS) process, which holds promise for frontier applications in polaritonic quantum devices. However, the stable excitation and coherent optical manipulation of PPS remain challenging due to scattering bottlenecks and rapid dephasing effect in polariton many-body systems. In this study, we first report the direct observation and optical amplification of non-degenerate intermode PPS lasing at room temperature (RT). The specific polariton branch of strong-coupled nanobelt planar microcavity is resonantly excited by a near-infrared (NIR) femtosecond laser via two-photon absorption (TPA) scheme, and the non-degenerate signal- and idler-states are stimulated. Angle-resolved dispersion patterns clearly reveal the evolution of the pump-, signal-, and idler-states under different excitation powers. Based on our self-constructed ultrafast femtosecond resonant optical trigger set-up, a selective enhancement and modulation of the signal-state is realized. Furthermore, the dynamic measurements of nonlinear signal-state enhancement process demonstrate a sub-picosecond response time (0.4ps), confirming its potential for ultrafast optical manipulation. Our work establishes a platform for exploring TPA-driven PPS laser and provides a novel optical modulation route for polariton-based optoelectronic devices.         ",

    "abstract": "           Symbol decoding in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems requires the deployment of fast, energy-efficient computing hardware deployable at the edge. The brute-force, exact maximum likelihood (ML) decoder, solved on conventional classical digital hardware, has exponential time complexity. Approximate classical solvers implemented on the same hardware have polynomial time complexity at the best. In this article, we design an alternative ring-oscillator-based coupled oscillator array to act as an oscillator Ising machine (OIM) and heuristically solve the ML-based MIMO detection problem. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is used to design the ring oscillators, and ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) technology is chosen as the coupling element (X) between the oscillators in this CMOS + X OIM design. For this purpose, we experimentally report high linear range of conductance variation (1 micro-S to 60 micro-S) in a FeFET device fabricated at 28 nm high-K/ metal gate (HKMG) CMOS technology node. We incorporate the conductance modulation characteristic in SPICE simulation of the ring oscillators connected in an all-to-all fashion through a crossbar array of these FeFET devices. We show that the above range of conductance variation of the FeFET device is suitable to obtain optimum OIM performance with no significant performance drop up to a MIMO size of 100 transmitting and 100 receiving antennas, thereby making FeFET a suitable device for this application. Our simulations and associated analysis using the Kuramoto model of oscillators also predict that this designed classical analog OIM, if implemented experimentally, will offer logarithmic scaling of computation time with MIMO size, thereby offering a huge improvement (in terms of computation speed) over aforementioned MIMO decoders run on conventional digital hardware.

Released GeSn membranes provide an additional degree of freedom to extend the operation wavelength through epitaxial strain relaxation, while their transferability expands design flexibility. On the other hand, metasurfaces have become an effective strategy to engineer light--matter interaction, and their integration with photodetectors can enhance performance and introduce new functionalities. Here, we demonstrate a mid-infrared photodetector consisting of a transfer-printed Ge$_{0.89}$Sn$_{0.11}$ membrane integrated with an Au plasmonic metasurface. The photodetector exhibits a wavelength cutoff exceeding 3.0~$\\mu$m with nearly fourfold increase in responsivity at 2.5~$\\mu$m as compared to unreleased films, attributed to Fabry--P\u00e9rot resonance. Furthermore, the integration with an anisotropic metasurface yields detectors with strong polarization sensitivity, achieving a measured contrast ratio of $\\sim$4:1 between orthogonal polarizations. Moreover, the operation wavelength of the photodetector can be selectively tuned by varying the geometric scale of the metasurface. The experimental results show excellent agreement with simulations, confirming the effectiveness and versatility of this integrated metasurface--membrane design.         ",

However, exploiting OAM beams in space has been hindered by the lack of a versatile design toolkit. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to tailor OAM across multiple transverse planes by shaping optical caustics leveraging on catastrophe theory. With complex-amplitude metasurfaces fabricated using two-photon polymerization lithography, we construct these caustics to steer Poynting vectors and achieve arbitrary shapes of OAM beams. Interestingly, we use such an approach to realize hidden OAM along the propagation trajectory, where the intensity of the beam is spread out thus avoiding detection. The OAM of these beams can be intrinsic, which avoids OAM distortions arising from the mixing of intrinsic and extrinsic components. By exploiting this intrinsic nature of OAM, we demonstrate the detection of encoded information in optical encryption. Our approach provides a unique framework for dynamic control of OAM in space, with promising applications in optical trapping and sensing, high-capacity data storage, and optical information security.

The unit cell is designed for impedance-matched absorption and modeled using full wave 3D electromagnetic simulation; S parameter and absorption analyses confirm a sharp resonance whose frequency is linearly responsive to the analyte RI. Angle and polarization studies, as well as geometry sweeps, establish robustness to incidence/polarization and identify the most sensitive geometric degrees of freedom; material sweeps further demonstrate controllability via graphene relaxation time and chemical potential.

Among its most intriguing concepts is photonic doping, where subwavelength dielectric inclusions embedded in ENZ media unlock exotic responses such as perfect magnetic conductor behavior and simultaneous epsilon-and-mu-near-zero properties. While prior demonstrations of photonic doping have been limited to microwave and far-infrared domains due to material losses, we demonstrate the feasibility of photonic doping at optical frequencies. Specifically, we implement photonic doping by embedding nanoparticle Mie resonators into an ultra-low-loss, all-dielectric ENZ platform realized with near-cutoff Bragg-reflection microcavities. We reveal the emergence of hybrid Bragg-Mie, near-zero-index modes whose fields localize within or between the nanoparticles. These modes exhibit substantially higher quality (Q) and Purcell factors than either the standalone nanoparticle array or the bare cavity. This mechanism enables the formation of highly isolated, spectrally pure electric and magnetic modes with dipolar or multipolar character. In representative photonically doped Bragg cavities, we predict Q factors on the order of 10000 and magnetic-dipole Purcell factors exceeding 4000 in the near-infrared region, associated with strong and high-Q magnetic hot spots localized within the nanoparticles. These results establish photonic doping of ENZ Bragg cavities as a powerful paradigm for achieving ultra-narrow-bandwidth, pure electric or magnetic Mie resonances, with exceptional potential for low-threshold nonlinear optics, magnetic dipole spectroscopy in atomic systems, and strong quantum optical light-matter interactions.

The on-chip comb sources are currently based on electro-optic modulation, mode-locked lasers, quantum cascade lasers, or soliton formation via Kerr nonlinearity. However, the widespread deployment of on-chip comb sources has remained elusive as they still require RF sources, high-Q resonators, or complex stabilization schemes while facing efficiency challenges. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip source of frequency comb based on the integration of a lithium niobate nanophotonic circuit with a semiconductor laser that can alleviate these challenges. For the first time, we show the formation of temporal topological solitons in a on-chip nanophotonic parametric oscillator with quadratic nonlinearity and low finesse. These solitons, independent of the dispersion regime, consist of phase defects separating two $\\pi$-out-of-phase continuous wave solutions at the signal frequency, which is at half the input pump frequency. We use on-chip cross-correlation for temporal measurements and confirm formation of topological solitons as short as 60 fs around 2 $\\mu$m, in agreement with a generalized parametrically forced Ginzburg-Landau theory. Moreover, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept turn-key operation of a hybrid-integrated source of topological frequency comb. Topological solitons offer a new paradigm for integrated comb sources, which are dispersion-sign agnostic and do not require high-Q resonators or high-speed modulators and can provide access to hard-to-access spectral regions, including mid-infrared.

This is inspired by similar observations in the basilar membrane of the mammalian inner ear. An aluminum beam is machined to introduce a gradual, asymmetric power-law taper at one of its ends. This tapered termination was then partially covered by viscoelastic tape to enhance the acoustic black hole effect in the system. This setup is then used to validate a model developed based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Following good agreement between the model and the experimental setup over a broad excitation frequency range (1 kHz to 10 kHz), the model is used to conduct a parametric study investigating the effects of different variables on the system's response. This study revealed the effectiveness of acoustic black holes in sustaining traveling waves over a broad frequency range. By optimizing parameters, such as the power-law order, one can significantly enhance this effect. This is especially noticeable towards the lower-frequency end.         ",

In this study, we investigate the elastic and strain--engineered mechanical, electronic properties and optical properties of the orthorhombic La2AlGaO6 (LAGO) hybrid perovskite using first--principles quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Structural optimizations were performed using both the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The mechanical stability of LAGO was confirmed through the Born--Huang criteria, and key elastic constants (C11, C12, C33, C44, and C66) were evaluated. These constants were further used to derive mechanical parameters such as Young's modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, Cauchy's pressure, and anisotropic factor, offering insights into the material's ductility, hardness, and elastic anisotropy. Crucially, we explored the influence of biaxial strain on the electronic band structure, DOS/PDOS, and Fermi energy, revealing significant band gap modulation under compressive and tensile strain, and hence, varying the optical properties. The coupling between elastic response and electronic structure highlights LAGO's potential for tunable device applications, where mechanical stimuli can be employed to tailor its electronic functionality.

    "abstract": "           The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) encapsulates the essential entanglement properties of a quantum many-body system and serves as a powerful theoretical construct. From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities, such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum. However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum many-body systems.         ",

Leveraging MECs, optically pumped 3He nuclear magnetometers have been developed since the earliest demonstrations of MEOP. However, it also induces an additional frequency shift and relaxation of the nuclear spin precession, thereby limiting the sensitivity of the magnetometer. In this work, we identify a new source of frequency shift and relaxation in the 3He nuclear spin, arising from the light shift. This effect arises from an MEC-mediated interaction between light and the nucleon spin. We develop a theoretical model to describe this light-induced effect and highlight its significance in low magnetic fields. This effect is experimentally demonstrated, and its dependence on various parameters -- including magnetic field strength, light intensity, and wavelength -- is investigated. Our result provides a better understanding of the frequency shift and relaxation of 3He spin precession under MEOP conditions. Moreover, our experiment reveals an MEC-mediated coupling between the 3He nuclear spin and light, which may indicate the feasibility of MEC-assisted optical manipulation of 3He nuclear spins at the quantum level, as proposed in several theoretical schemes.

Our vibrational sum frequency generation spectra also illustrate high accuracy for the considered air-water interface system.

    "abstract": "           Reconstructing high-fidelity fluid flow fields from sparse sensor measurements is vital for many science and engineering applications but remains challenging because of dimensional disparities between state and observational spaces. Due to such dimensional differences, the measurement operator becomes ill-conditioned and non-invertible, making the reconstruction of flow fields from sensor measurements extremely difficult. Although sparse optimization and machine learning address the above problems to some extent, questions about their generalization and efficiency remain, particularly regarding the discretization dependence of these models. In this context, deep operator learning offers a better solution as this approach models mappings between infinite-dimensional functional spaces, enabling superior generalization and discretization-independent reconstruction. We introduce FLRONet, a deep operator learning framework that is trained to reconstruct fluid flow fields from sparse sensor measurements. FLRONet employs a branch-trunk network architecture to represent the inverse measurement operator that maps sensor observations to the original flow field, a continuous function of both space and time. Validation performed on the CFDBench dataset has demonstrated that FLRONet consistently achieves high levels of reconstruction accuracy and robustness, even in scenarios where sensor measurements are inaccurate or missing. Furthermore, the operator learning approach endows FLRONet with the capability to perform zero-shot super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains, offering a solution for rapid reconstruction of high-fidelity flow fields.

    "abstract": "           Recent work has highlighted the remarkable properties of quantum turbulence in superfluid helium II, consisting of a disordered tangle of quantised vortex lines which interact with each other and reconnect when they collide. According to Landau's two-fluid theory, these vortex lines move in a surrounding of thermal excitations called the normal fluid. Until now, the normal fluid has often been considered a passive background which simply provides the vortex lines with a mechanism for dissipating their kinetic energy into heat. Using a model which fully takes into account the two-way interaction between the vortex lines and the normal fluid, here we show numerically that each vortex line creates a macroscopic wake in the normal fluid that can be larger than the average distance between vortex lines; this is surprising, given the microscopic size of the superfluid vortex cores which induce these wakes. We show that in heat transfer experiments, the flow of the normal fluid can therefore be described as the superposition of an imposed uniform flow and wakes generated by the vortex lines, leading to non-classical statistics of the normal fluid velocity. We also argue that this first evidence of independent fluid structures in the thermal excitations postulated by Landau may be at the root of recent, unaccounted for, experimental findings.         ",

The design, which is compatible with the stack-and-draw fabrication process, consists of a cross-sectional photonic topological crystalline insulator with a disclination. A bulk-defect correspondence produces degenerate topological modes, lying below the cladding light line. We use various theoretical methods to confirm their topological origins, including a spectral localiser that makes minimal assumptions about the bandstructure. Our experiments on the fabricated topological fibre show it transmitting visible to near-infrared light with low losses of 10--20 dB/km, which do not increase much when the fibre is bent. A comparable solid-core PCF of conventional design exhibits substantially higher bending losses. Optical fibres based on topological modes thus hold promise for improved performance and novel functionalities.         ",

Simultaneously, the lasers provide real-time sensing of dynamic changes at the microplastic surface with nanoscale resolution.

Here, we theoretically demonstrate that the plasmon dispersion relation at a metal-dielectric interface can be reconstructed from the resonance peaks of transmission spectra obtained in a series of extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) experiments on plasmonic gratings. A proof-of-concept of direct E-k dispersion mapping is numerically implemented by systematically varying the grating's unit cell size, with each grating serving as a discrete probe in momentum space. The resulting plasmon dispersion curves are derived from the frequencies of Fabry-Perot (FP) resonances localized within subwavelength apertures, scaled by a correction factor that accounts for the interplay between the resonant mechanisms driving enhanced transmission. This factor highlights the aperture's role in mode confinement and resonance shifting, which we examine in both idealized perfect electric conductor (PEC) and realistic dispersive metal regimes. To elucidate eigenstates of the plasmonic system and quantify the modal hybridization within its apertures, we perform a non-Hermitian modal decomposition using the finite element method (FEM) and corroborate it with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations.

    "abstract": "           Ring origami, consisting of closed-loop rods, is a class of shape-morphing structures that undergo shape transformation through folding enabled by snap-buckling instabilities, referred to as snap-folding instabilities. Previous studies have shown that 2D ring origami composed of rod segments with in-plane natural curvature (i.e., the stress-free curved state lies in the plane of the planar ring) can achieve diverse and intriguing 2D-to-2D shape transformations. Here, we propose a 2D-to-3D shape transformation strategy for ring origami by introducing out-of-plane natural curvature (i.e., the stress-free curved state lies in a plane perpendicular to the planar ring) into the rod segments. Due to natural curvature-induced out-of-plane bending moments, a 2D elastic ring spontaneously snaps out-of-plane and reaches equilibrium in a 3D configuration. These snapping-induced out-of-plane shape transitions not only enable self-guided, spontaneous shape morphing, but also allow the construction of complex structures from simple geometries, making them promising for the design of functional deployable and foldable structures. By combining a multi-segment Kirchhoff rod model with finite element simulations and experiments, we systematically investigate the 3D equilibrium states and transition behavior of these systems. Using square and hexagonal rings as representative examples, we demonstrate that by rationally designing the out-of-plane natural curvature of rod segments, 2D rings can exhibit a range of functional behaviors, including spontaneous 2D-to-3D shape transformation (e.g., planar square to sphere) via snap-folding, multistability with various 3D configurations, and monostability with a compact zero-energy 3D configuration.

Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using the $^1S_0$ -> $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\\times 10^5$ atoms down to 5 $\\mu$K and reaching a density of $\\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with a probability of about $50\\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\\%$, while maintaining a survival probability of $97(2)\\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a temperature of $12.92(5)$ $\\mu$K for the atoms in the tweezers, and the ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 minutes. These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum information processing with Sr atoms.

    "abstract": "           The light--matter interaction in optical cavities offers a promising ground to create hybrid states and manipulate material properties. In this work, we examine the effect of light-matter coupling in the excitonic insulator phase using a quasi one-dimensional lattice model with two opposite parity orbitals at each site. We show that the model allows for a coupling between the collective phase mode and cavity photons. Our findings reveal that the collective mode of the excitonic state significantly impacts the dispersion of the cavity mode, giving rise to an avoiding band crossing in the photon dispersion. This phenomenon is absent in trivial and topological insulator phases and also in phonon-mediated excitonic insulators, underscoring the unique characteristics of collective excitations in excitonic insulators. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of light-matter interaction on photon propagation in the presence of excitonic collective excitations.         ",

While single-parameter quantum metrology is well established, many metrological tasks require joint multiparameter estimation, which poses new conceptual challenges that have so far only been explored theoretically. We experimentally demonstrate multiparameter quantum metrology with an array of entangled atomic ensembles. By splitting a spin-squeezed ensemble, we create an atomic sensor array featuring inter-sensor entanglement that can be flexibly configured to enhance measurement precision of multiple parameters jointly. Using an optimal estimation protocol, we achieve significant gains over the standard quantum limit in key multiparameter estimation tasks, thus grounding the concept of quantum enhancement of field sensor arrays and imaging devices.

    "abstract": "           Error mitigation is essential for near-term quantum devices, and two promising techniques are universal frame randomization and Randomized Compilation. These methods insert random twirling gates into a circuit to reduce errors while preserving unitarity and depth. We apply universal frame randomization and Randomized Compilation to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with $p=1$ on a superconducting quantum circuit system, demonstrating its potential to improve energy calculations. Specifically, we investigate the use of QAOA to calculate the lowest energy state of a frustrated Ising ring system and compare the results of randomized circuits generated using both techniques. Our results show that both methods can mitigate errors, with expected extremal energy values of $5.25\\pm0.145$ and $4.08\\pm0.36$, for Randomized Compilation and universal frame randomization respectively, compared to $2.63\\pm0.068$ without randomization and $5.676\\pm0.006$ with a noiseless simulator.

    "abstract": "           Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.

    "abstract": "           Specular reflection can be problematic for the determination of the cloud thermodynamic phase for near-nadir-pointing space LIDARs. A LIDAR system biased towards the specular contribution for backscatter, if near-concurrent to a conventional LIDAR, could calibrate the measurements required for cloud phase determination. One such system which shows promise for this is quantum parametric mode sorting (QPMS) LIDAR. Through a non-linear interaction and time-frequency mode selectivity, this system demonstrates in-band noise-rejection beyond what linear noise filtering can provide. This level of noise-rejection means the signal strength can be minimised, therefore biasing the specular contribution to the return signal. Here we provide a theoretical model of QPMS LIDAR applied to this scenario to instruct its feasibility.         ",

    "title": "Electric Field-Induced Kerr Rotation on Metallic Surfaces",
    "abstract": "           We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\\theta_K^s$ and $\\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\\theta_K^s$ and $\\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\\theta_K^s$ and $\\theta_K^p$.         ",
