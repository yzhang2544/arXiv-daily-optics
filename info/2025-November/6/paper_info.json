    "abstract": "           Neural quantum states (NQS) are a promising ansatz for solving many-body quantum problems due to their inherent expressiveness. Yet, this expressiveness can only be harnessed efficiently for treating identical particles if the suitable physical knowledge is hardwired into the neural network itself. For electronic structure, NQS based on backflow determinants has been shown to be a powerful ansatz for capturing strong correlation. By contrast, the analogue for bosons, backflow permanents, is unpractical due to the steep cost of computing the matrix permanent and due to the lack of particle conservation in common bosonic problems. To circumvent these obstacles, we introduce a modal backflow (MBF) NQS design and demonstrate its efficacy by solving the anharmonic vibrational problem. To accommodate the demand of high accuracy in spectroscopic calculations, we implement a selected-configuration scheme for evaluating physical observables and gradients, replacing the standard stochastic approach based on Monte Carlo sampling. A vibrational self-consistent field calculation is conveniently carried out within the MBF network, which serves as a pretraining step to accelerate and stabilize the optimization. In applications to both artificial and ab initio Hamiltonians, we find that the MBF network is capable of delivering spectroscopically accurate zero-point energies and vibrational transitions in all anharmonic regimes.

    "abstract": "           We propose a particle acceleration mechanism driven by large-amplitude Alfv\u00e9n waves in a strong magnetic field. The acceleration process proceeds through multiple stages triggered by counterpropagating wave-particle resonant acceleration (CWRA) via decay instability. Initially, parent and daughter Alfv\u00e9n waves resonantly accelerate particles perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. The resultant modulational instability generates electrostatic fields within the wave packet, which are locally amplified by the ponderomotive force of the Alfv\u00e9n wave packet. These fields subsequently drive further acceleration within a few relativistic gyroperiods via gyroresonant surfing acceleration (GRSA). During this, the v*B force facilitates momentum transfer from the perpendicular to the parallel direction. In the later stage, particles become trapped by the parent wave and gain additional energy through single wave resonant acceleration (SWRA). Furthermore, the accumulation of accelerated particles induces electrostatic trailing fields behind and at the tail of the wave packet, which drive trailing-field acceleration (TFA) of other electrons. The combined effects of these mechanisms, CWRA followed by GRSA and SWRA, result in highly relativistic electron energy. The electron energy accelerated through the above process is higher than that accelerated through TFA. This multistage acceleration process provides insights into the generation of high energy cosmic rays in astrophysical environments.         ",

    "title": "Particle-in-cell simulations of laser crossbeam energy transfer via magnetized ion-acoustic wave",
    "abstract": "           Large magnetic fields, either imposed externally or produced spontaneously, are often present in laser-driven high-energy-density systems. In addition to changing plasma conditions, magnetic fields also directly modify laser-plasma interactions (LPI) by changing participating waves and their nonlonear interactions. In this paper, we use two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to investigate how magnetic fields directly affect crossbeam energy transfer (CBET) from a pump to a seed laser beam, when the transfer is mediated by the ion-acoustic wave (IAW) quasimode. Our simulations are performed in the parameter space where CBET is the dominant process, and in a linear regime where pump depletion, distribution function evolution, and secondary instabilities are insignificant. We use a Fourier filter to separate out the seed signal, and project the seed fields to two electromagnetic eigenmodes, which become nondegenerate in magnetized plasmas. By comparing the seed energy before CBET occurs and after CBET reaches quasi-steady state, we extract CBET energy gains of both eigenmodes for lasers that are initially linearly polarized. Our simulations reveal that starting from a few MG fields, the two eigenmodes have different gains, and magnetization alters how the gains depend on laser detuning. The overall gain decreases with magnetization when the laser polarizations are initially parallel, while a nonzero gain becomes allowed when the laser polarizations are initially orthogonal. These findings qualitatively agree with theoretical expectations.         ",

    "abstract": "           Coherent detection and interferometry in the terahertz (THz) regime are key capabilities that enable applications ranging from astronomy to non-destructive testing. Phase-sensitive THz detection is currently achieved using nonlinear crystals or external interferometers and photomixers. However, the former approach requires femtosecond pulsed radiation, and all approaches suffer from a large footprint and sensitive alignment. Here, we demonstrate a graphene-enabled, on-chip, integrated THz detector-interferometer with optical cavity and antenna, exhibiting high sensitivity to the phase of incident THz light. We exploit this by determining the thickness of thin films placed in front of the detector-interferometer, obtaining a strongly sub-wavelength thickness accuracy of $\\sim$5 $\\mu$m, while we predict that an accuracy of 10 nm is within reach. This is relevant for a range of industrial application domains, including automotive, construction, and health. The detector-interferometer moreover exhibits a record-high external responsivity - without any normalization to a diffraction-limited spot size - of 73 mA/W and a noise-equivalent power of 79 pW$~\\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. This performance is due to enhanced absorption at the cavity mode around 89 GHz, in agreement with multi-physics simulations. These results pave the way to exploiting coherent wave detection in the THz regime with utility in spectroscopy, next-generation wireless communication, and beyond.         ",

We investigate the behavior of a Shockley-Read-Hall recombination via Al vacancies-oxygen complexes in AlN barriers as a function of GaN well thickness and come to the conclusion that direct relaxation of confined states via mid-gap traps is prohibited and the main mechanism limiting the quantum efficiency (QE) is the carrier escape followed by non-radiative SRH recombination in the AlN barriers. As a consequence, the QE is highly dependent on the defect density, QW width and temperature which allowed us to reach a descent emissions at 226 nm wavelength although at wall plug efficiency being low, at 0.02%. We build a complete Light-Current-Voltage model and find that present device performance is limited by the self-heating and by the Child's space charge effect, both limitations can be easily addressed with some additional engineering efforts.

The present code has been built to solve the Hamiltonian of a system that can include nuclei and fermions of different mass and charge, e.g. electrons and positrons, embedded in an environment of classical charges and quantum Drude oscillators. To approximate the ground state of this many-particle operator, the code features different wavefunctions. For the fermionic particles, beyond the traditional Slater determinant, QMeCha also includes Geminal functions such as the Pfaffian, and presents different types of explicit correlation terms in the Jastrow factors. The classical point charges and quantum Drude oscillators, described through different variational ans\u00e4tze, are used to model a molecular environment capable of explicitly describing dispersion, polarization, and electrostatic effects experienced by the nuclear and fermionic subsystem. To integrate these wavefunctions, efficient variational Monte Carlo and diffusion Monte Carlo protocols have been developed, together with a robust wavefunction optimization procedure that features correlated sampling. In conclusion, QMeCha is a massively parallel code introduced here to explore quantum correlation effects in mixed systems with thousands of fermions and bosonic particles, beyond what was previously accessible to other reference methods.

    "abstract": "           Photonic resonances are a powerful tool for controlling light-matter interactions. However, unlocking many of the most scientifically intriguing and technologically promising phenomena requires entering the strong coupling regime, where light and matter fully mix, unlocking emergent properties of the coupled states. Nowadays, distinguishing between weak and strong coupling primarily relies on studying the optical response of the hybrid system at real frequencies, which only provides indirect estimates of the underlying resonant dynamics. In contrast, the actual resonances live at complex frequencies. Resolving this contradiction, we show that photonic resonant states provide the framework to unambiguously quantify the strength of light-matter interaction, enabling a rigorous distinction between weak and strong coupling regimes. Assuming a single dominant resonant state of the bare photonic resonator, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that captures the interaction between the photonic resonator and an arbitrary number of material resonances. Our analysis reveals that, unlike most coupled-oscillator models commonly employed in the literature, hybridization not only introduces off-diagonal coupling but also shifts the bare eigenfrequency of the photonic mode. We demonstrate the accuracy of this approach by studying planar and spherical silver resonators filled with a molecular material whose properties were extracted from quantum-chemical simulations. Our work paves the way towards a unified description of light-matter coupling in open photonic environments.         ",

However, comparing SHG performance across materials remains challenging as the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\\chi^{(2)}$ spans several orders of magnitude and strongly depends on the band gap $E_g$. To address this, we empirically validate a theoretical upper bound on $\\chi^{(2)}$ using new databases of \\textit{ab initio}-computed nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. We then formulate a normalized descriptor, $\\hat{d}$, which expresses the NLO response of a material relative to the band gap-dependent physical limit. We show that $\\hat{d}$ exhibits a similar distribution across a wide range of band gap energies. This universality supports the use of $\\hat{d}$ as a robust, generalizable descriptor for data-driven and chemistry-informed machine learning models of NLO response, enabling accelerated materials discovery and optimization across broad application frequencies.

    "abstract": "           Molecular spin systems are promising candidates for quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing, yet their characterization at room temperature remains challenging due to fast spin decoherence. In this work, we use $T_1$ relaxometry of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to probe the electron spin ensemble of a polycrystalline copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) thin film. In addition to unequivocally identifying the NV-CuPc interaction thanks to its hyperfine spectrum, we further extract key parameters of the CuPc spin ensemble, including its correlation time and local lattice orientation, that cannot be measured in bulk electron resonance experiments. The analysis of our experimental results confirms that electron-electron interactions dominate the decoherence dynamics of CuPc at room temperature. Additionally, we demonstrate that the CuPc-enhanced NV relaxometry can serve as a robust method to estimate the NV depth with $\\sim1$~nm precision. Our results establish NV centers as powerful probes for molecular spin systems, providing insights into molecular qubits, spin bath engineering, and hybrid quantum materials, and offering a potential pathway toward their applications such as molecular-scale quantum processors and spin-based quantum networks.

This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.         ",

    "abstract": "           The use of macroscopic coherent quantum states at room temperature is crucial in modern quantum technologies. In light of recent experiments demonstrating high-temperature superfluorescence in hybrid perovskite thin films, in this work we investigate the stability of the superradiant state concerning exciton-phonon interactions. We focused on a quasi-2D Wannier exciton interacting with longitudinal optical (LO) phonons in polar crystals, as well as with acoustic phonons. Our study leads to the derivation of nonlinear equations in the coordinate space that govern the exciton wavefunction's coefficient in the single-exciton basis for the lowest exciton state, which translates to the complex-valued polarization. The resulting equations take the form of a 2D nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. We perform a linear stability analysis of the plane wave solutions for the equations in question, which allows us to establish stability criteria. This analysis is particularly important for evaluating the stability of the superradiant state in the considered quasi-2D structures, as the superradiant state represents a specific case of the plane wave solution. Our findings indicate that, when the exciton interacts with LO phonons, a plane wave solution is modulationally stable, provided that the square of its amplitude does not exceed a critical intensity value defined by the exciton-LO phonon interaction parameters. Furthermore, interactions between the exciton and acoustic phonons reduce the intensity of modulationally stable waves compared to the case without such interactions. Our analytical results are corroborated by numerical calculations. We also numerically solve the 2D nonlocal NLS equation in the polar coordinates and obtain its fundamental soliton solution, which is stable.         ",

For this purpose, transmission spectroscopy measurements are performed under the influence of a strong magnetic field at different set points for the electric gate bias. The resulting Landau polariton dispersion depends on the applied electric bias, as the gating technique confines the electrons in-plane down to extremely sub-wavelength dimensions as small as d = 410 nm. This confinement allows for the excitation of standing plasma waves at zero magnetic field and an effective tunability of the electron number coupled to the THz resonator. This allows the normalized coupling strength to be tuned in-situ from $\\eta$ = 0.46 down to $\\eta$ = 0.18. This is the first demonstration of terahertz far-field spectroscopy of an electrically tunable interaction between a single terahertz resonator and electrons in a GaAs quantum well heterostructure.

Our approach resolves the problem that duality transformations which simultaneously combine $\\mathbf{E}$ with $\\mathbf{H}$ and $\\mathbf{D}$ with $\\mathbf{B}$ are incompatible with linear constitutive relations. We find that the helicity density in a medium, as the conserved quantity associated with duality transforms, must contain an explicit contribution associated with the polarisation and magnetisation of the matter, and that it can be expressed naturally in terms of the elementary polarised excitations of the system. In media for which the helicity is conserved, each circular excitation carries a well-defined helicity. However, in a medium for which the helicity is not conserved, we find that the time-varying helicity can be viewed in terms of oscillations between different helicity eigenstates, analogous to neutrino oscillations. Here we explicitly study the helicity in homogeneous and lossless media but we believe that, differently to other choices, this helicity is readily generalisable to media that may be inhomogeneous, lossy, chiral or nonreciprocal.

A significant challenge in optical trap arrays is to achieve site-resolved, point-to-point tunability: adjusting the laser parameters of a single trap typically induces global cross-talk to neighboring sites, hindering independent control. Inspired by tunable couplers in superconducting circuits, we implement an ancillary nanoparticle that functions as a coupler between two target nanoparticles. Within a reconfigurable three-particle array, we demonstrate broad tunability of the direct dipole-dipole interaction by controlling the phase and position of the traps. In addition, we observe spectral signatures consistent with mediated interactions between the target particles via the ancillary one, manifested as mode participation beyond the uncoupled response. Our results establish a practical route to tailored, site-resolved control in multi-particle optical trap arrays, expanding the optical-binding toolbox and opening opportunities for programmable oscillator networks relevant to macroscopic quantum mechanics and precision sensing.

We show that tilting the illumination can enhance localization precision and accuracy per detected photon, while increasing robustness to defocusing. Surprisingly, rotating coherent scattering microscopy (rocs), which incoherently averages oblique illuminations, achieves higher spatial resolution but lower localization precision.

Hereby we present several theorems to answer this question and provide a complete optimal scheme to realize the ultimate precision limit in practice.

    "abstract": "           Entanglement-enhanced quantum sensors encounter a fundamental trade-off: while entanglement improves precision to the Heisenberg limit, it restricts dynamic range. To address this trade-off, we present a credible-interval-based adaptive Bayesian quantum frequency estimation protocol for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-state-based atomic clocks. Our method optimally integrates prior knowledge with new measurements and determines the interrogation time by correlating it with the period of the likelihood function, based on Bayesian credible intervals. Our protocol can be implemented using either individual or cascaded GHZ states, thereby extending the dynamic range without compromising Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. In parallel with the cascaded-GHZ-state protocol using fixed interrogation times, the dynamic range can be extended through an interferometry sequence that employs individual GHZ states with variable interrogation times. Furthermore, by varying the interrogation times, the dynamic range of the cascaded-GHZ-state protocol can be further extended. Crucially, our protocol enables dual Heisenberg-limited precision scaling $\\propto 1/(Nt)$ in both particle number $N$ and total interrogation time $t$, surpassing the hybrid scaling $\\propto 1/{(N\\sqrt {t}})$ of the conventional cascaded-GHZ-state protocol. While offering a wider dynamic range, the protocol is more stable against noise and more robust to dephasing than existing adaptive schemes. Beyond atomic clocks, our approach establishes a general framework for developing entanglement-enhanced quantum sensors that simultaneously achieve both high precision and broad dynamic range.
