In photonic crystals, symmetry-protected quasi-BICs (SP-qBIC) have been realized at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and utilized in photonic crystal and distributed feedback lasers. In the present work, we measure wavevector-resolved photoluminescence (PL) of monolayer WSe2 weakly coupled to a photonic slab, consisting of a square array of aluminum nanodisks. The results show that the slab supports a continuous band of symmetry-protected quasi-bound states along the Gamma-X direction, extending from the previously reported SP-qBIC at the Gamma point. The spectral width of this quasi-bound band in the continuum remains narrow through at least a half of the Brillouin zone, indicating its long lifetime.         ",

    "title": "A broadband silicon photonic-integrated-circuit based RF spectrum analyzer with 10 MHz spectral resolution",
    "abstract": "           Designing miniaturized optical spectrometers is an increasingly active area of research as spectrometers are crucial components for a wide range of applications including chemical and material analysis, medical diagnostics, classical and quantum sensing, characterization of light sources, and radio frequency (RF) spectrum analysis. Among these applications, designing on-chip spectrometers for RF spectrum analysis is particularly challenging since it requires combining high resolution and large bandwidth with a fast update rate. Existing chip-scale spectrometers cannot achieve the resolution required for RF analysis, setting aside challenges in maintaining a fast update rate and broad bandwidth. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a silicon photonic integrated circuit (PIC)-based RF spectrum analyzer that combines an ultra-high-resolution speckle spectrometer with an interferometric RF-to-optical encoding scheme. The PIC-based speckle spectrometer uses a path-mismatched multimode interferometer with inverse designed splitters to compensate for waveguide loss, enabling a record-high resolution of 100 MHz (0.8 pm at a wavelength of 1550 nm). To further improve the resolution of the overall RF spectrum analyzer, we modify the RF-to-optical encoding scheme by directing the RF signal through a path mismatched interferometer and encoding the outputs of the RF interferometer on separate optical carriers. This further reduces the RF spectral correlation width of the combined system, enabling the RF spectrum analyzer to resolve RF tones separated by 10 MHz across a bandwidth of 10 GHz. Since this approach operates as a single-shot spectrometer, it can support fast update rates, providing a path to compact, persistent wideband RF spectrum analysis.         ",

    "abstract": "           This paper presents an enhanced version of the subgroup method for resonance self-shielding treatment, termed the robust subgroup method, which integrates Robust Estimation (RE) with a Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. The RE approach is employed to handle model misspecification and data contamination, while the DE algorithm serves as an optimization tool within the RE framework to obtain constrained solutions. Numerical validation against experimental benchmarks shows that the proposed method removes a systematic absorption bias in conventional subgroup fits that would otherwise depress reactivity. This bias appears only in benchmarks sensitive to U-238. Mechanistically, it reflects a threshold-like conditioning failure: strong self-shielding leverage dominates the loss and is magnified by dilution-induced multicollinearity. This adverse conditioning appears to be seeded by a narrow, sparse resonance structure at low energies in fertile even-even nuclides, thereby causing rapid self-shielding response saturation and a weak Doppler broadening. By bounding influence and enforcing feasibility within an RE-DE framework, the inferred subgroup parameters track the underlying physics more faithfully, improving the predictive fidelity of subsequent transport simulations.

We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap, plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a matrix-product-operator engine yield two to four percent agreement with published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies; higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees of freedom or numerical methods.

Herein, we introduce 10-nm structured silicon as a promising UV-readable data storage platform. Recording on it harnesses the amorphous-to-crystalline phase-change of silicon, the two phases presenting well-constrasted UV optical properties. Furthermore, the phase-change contrast is strongly enhanced in the Vacuum UV thanks to the distinct interband plasmon resonances of the amorphous and crystalline nanostructures, which have an epsilon-near-zero and surface plasmonic character, respectively. Silicon nanogratings with a 10 nm width and a 20 nm period resonate near the wavelength of 120 nm, at which phase-change induces a 600% maximum optical transmittance contrast. This paves the way toward UV-readable data storage platforms with a 10 to 100 times increased data density, which could be implemented by harnessing the well-established silicon nanotechnology.

The theory describes the excitation spectrum and enhancement of SHG at both leaky mode and quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC) resonances in terms of the material parameters. For low-loss systems, the SHG efficiency at leaky resonances is determined by their radiative broadening, governed by the relevant Fourier harmonics of the metasurface polarizability, whereas the SHG enhancement at quasi-BIC resonances is ultimately limited by inhomogeneous broadening and absorption in the system. We also describe the emergence and polarization properties of second harmonic diffracted beams. These beams appear even if both the 2D crystal and the meta-waveguide are centrosymmetric owing to the nonlocal mechanism of SHG. The developed framework provides a systematic theoretical basis for optimizing the resonant nonlinear frequency conversion in hybrid 2D-material-metasurface platforms and identifies the fundamental limitations of the SHG efficiency.

We investigate radiation of optical whispering-gallery modes in regimes of coherent and incoherent luminescence. The use of different experimental regimes allows us to disentangle the different contributions to the CL in spheres, namely, photon absorption, generation and radiative leakage, and conclude that the photon generation occurs precisely on the sphere's surface. In addition, the spheres serve as high-NA collimating lenses for CL, resulting in mode quality unprecedented for CL in free space. We believe that such collimated and directed CL in free space will enhance existing quantum measurements of CL and facilitate new ones, such as high-rate electron-photon entangled pairs, CL from quantum emitters, and homodyne analysis of CL.

    "abstract": "           3D-printed materials are used in many different industries (automotive, aviation, medicine, etc.). Most of these 3D-printed materials are based on ceramics or polymers whose mechanical properties vary with frequency. For numerical modeling, it is crucial to characterize this frequency dependency accurately to enable realistic finite-element simulations. At the same time, the damping behavior plays a key role in product development, since it governs a component's response at resonance and thus impacts both performance and longevity. In current research, inverse material characterization methods are getting more and more popular. However, their practical validation and applicability on real measurement data have not yet been discussed widely. In this work, we show the identification of two different materials, POM and additively manufactured sintered ceramics, and validate it with experimental data of a well-established measurement technique (dynamic mechanical analysis). The material identification process considers state-of-the-art reduced-order modeling and constrained particle swarm optimization, which are used to fit the frequency response functions of point measurements obtained by a laser Doppler vibrometer. This work shows the quality of the method in identifying the parameters defining the viscoelastic fractional derivative model, including their uncertainty. It also illustrates the applicability of this identification method in the presence of practical difficulties that come along with experimental data such as boundary conditions and noise.         ",

Photoluminescence (PL) measurements from implanted regions reveal Stark-split 4f-4f transitions consistent with bulk Er-doped lithium niobate, indicating similar lattice occupation. Temperature-dependent PL measurements from 300 K to 5 K exhibit conventional behaviour down to approximately 50 K, followed by a marked decrease in the emission intensity and lifetime. This anomaly is attributed to a suppression of the pyroelectric response in LiNbO3 at low temperatures, which affects local electric fields and, consequently, Er3+ emission. The sensitivity of the PL response to the modulation frequency and polarization of the 980 nm excitation light is also consistent with possible mechanisms linking thermal effects and internal fields arising in the thin film. The results demonstrate a method for the targeted doping with Er3+ ions into the most widely used cut of TFLN for integrated photonic devices and provide further important considerations for their exploitation in cryogenic quantum devices.

This framework enables data-driven understanding and prediction of complex physical phenomena. While coefficient functions in PIML are typically estimated on the basis of predictive performance, physics as a discipline does not rely solely on prediction accuracy to evaluate models. For example, Kepler's heliocentric model was favored owing to small discrepancies in planetary motion, despite its similar predictive accuracy to the geocentric model. This highlights the inherent uncertainties in data-driven model inference and the scientific importance of selecting physically meaningful solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework to quantify and analyze such uncertainties in the estimation of coefficient functions in PIML. We apply our framework to reduced model of magnetohydrodynamics and our framework shows that there are uncertainties, and unique identification is possible with geometric constraints.

III-V semiconductor quantum dots excel as deterministic and coherent photon emitters, while rare-earth ions such as erbium (Er$^{3+}$) in crystalline oxides offer exceptional spin and optical coherence at telecom wavelengths. Combining these systems and their functionalities via direct epitaxy is challenging due to lattice mismatch and incompatible growth conditions. Here we demonstrate low-temperature pulsed laser deposition of Er$^{3+}$-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Controlled surface preparation with an arsenic cap and an oxygen-deficient buffer layer enables the growth of epitaxial anatase TiO$_{2}$ (001) at 390$^{o}$C with sub-300 pm surface roughness, while avoiding interface degradation. In contrast, high-temperature oxide desorption or growth temperatures drive the transition to rough, polycrystalline rutile film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Minimal coincident interface area (MCIA) modeling explains the orientation-selective growth on GaAs and GaSb. Raman and cryogenic photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy verify the crystal phase and optical activation of Er$^{3+}$ ions. This multi-parameter growth strategy helps preserve III-V quantum dot functionality and yields smooth surfaces suitable for low-loss nanophotonic structures.

With all of the required optoelectronic devices and electronic circuits integrated in a chiplet only about 2 cm by 3 cm in size, 175 billon parameters in the case of GPT-3 are shown to perform inference at an unprecedented speed of 12.6 POPS using only a 40 nm CMOS process node, along with a high power efficiency of 74 TOPS/W and a high area efficiency of 19 TOPS/mm2, both surpassing the related digital electronics by roughly two orders of magnitude. The influence of the quantization formats and the hardware induced errors are numerically investigated, and are shown to have a minimal impact. Our study presents a new yet practical path toward analog neural processing units (NPUs) to complement existing digital processing units.         ",

Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.         ",

This motivates the \"inverse problem\" of quantum many-body physics: given microscopic systems with experimentally realistic two-body interactions, how to design a Hamiltonian that realizes a desired topological phase? Here we solve this problem on a platform motivated by Rydberg atoms, where elementary two-level systems couple via simple blockade interactions. Within this framework, we construct Hamiltonians that realize topological orders described by non-abelian quantum double models. We analytically prove the existence of topological order in the ground state, and present efficient schemes to prepare these states. We also introduce protocols for the controlled adiabatic braiding of anyonic excitations to probe their non-abelian statistics. Our construction is generic and applies to quantum doubles $\\mathcal{D}(G)$ for arbitrary finite groups $G$. We illustrate braiding for the simplest non-abelian quantum double $\\mathcal{D}(S_3)$.         ",

The system is built around a common hardware, firmware and software stack shared accross different projects, thereby drastically reducing the development effort and cost. It consists of a custom Control and Readout (CaR) board and a commercial Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip (SoC) platform. The SoC platform runs a full Yocto distribution integrating the custom software framework (Peary) and a custom FPGA firmware built within a common firmware infrastructure (Boreal). The CaR board provides a hardware environment featuring various services such as powering, slow-control, and high-speed data links for the target detector prototype. Boreal and Peary, in turn, offer firmware and software architectures that enable seamless integration of control and readout for new devices. While the first version of the system used a SoC platform based on the ZC706 evaluation board, migration to a Zynq UltraScale+ architecture is progressing towards the support of the ZCU102 board and the ultimate objective of integrating the SoC functionality directly into the CaR board, eliminating the need for separate evaluation boards. This paper describes the Caribou system, focusing on the latest project developments and showcasing progress and future plans across its hardware, firmware, and software components.         ",

This report identifies the experimental skills needed for individuals with bachelor's or master's degrees to succeed in quantum industry roles. Through semi-structured interviews with quantum industry employers, we gathered data on 22 distinct positions spanning hardware, software, and business functions. While employers describe varying expectations of quantum expertise, the unifying requirement across these roles is proficiency in experimental skills, which fall into four key categories: instrumentation, computation and data analysis, experimental and project design, as well as communication and collaboration. Positions open to bachelor's and master's graduates use all four skill areas, but the balance of experimental skill set needed differs. Bachelor's roles lean toward instrumentation, computation and data analysis, as well as experimental and project design skills. Individuals in these roles build, operate, and troubleshoot hardware, and they gather and interpret data to design and carry out experiments. Master's roles stand out with the communication and collaboration skills needed on top of the other three skill categories. Individuals in these roles oversee experiments, coordinate teams, and align efforts with company and client needs. By articulating experimental skills needed for bachelor's and master's roles in the quantum industry, this report provides actionable insights for educators developing QISE courses and programs.

We find that ionic systems display an overall suppression of inelastic transitions leading to recombination rates and lifetimes of Efimov state orders of magnitude smaller with respect to those for neutral atoms. We further characterize the dense spectra of triatomic molecular ions with extended lifetimes. Our results provide a deeper insight on the universality and structure of three-body ionic systems and establishing them as a promising platform for exploring novel few- and many-body phenomena with long-range interactions.

Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a loss function that enforces the Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics and enables bounding the error with the exact evolution via the global loss function. We showcase the method by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D, uncovering signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, our method is competitive compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches, while unlocking previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.

Here, we perform post-selective two-photon interference measurements between mutually detuned resonance fluorescence signals from an InAs quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity. At small mutual laser detunings (<=0.5GHz), the results are accurately described by the pure-state model [Nat. Commun. 16, 6453 (2025)], which treats all resonance-fluorescence photons as spontaneous emission. At larger detunings, we uncover an anomalous feature in the two-photon interference, where the normalised second-order correlation function under orthogonal polarisations yields g2_vert(0) < 0.5.

    "abstract": "           Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern\" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Spin splitting in emerging altermagnets is non-relativistic and momentum-dependent, yet energy-independent, and localized in momentum space, posing challenges for practical applications. Here, we propose an intercalation-driven paradigm for altermagnets to attain ameliorative electronic structures, multiferroic characteristics, and anomalous and spin transport functionalities. As a representative system, we investigate electrochemistry- and self-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers, building on the recently reported room-temperature K- and Rb-intercalated V2Se2O family [Nat. Phys. 2025, 21, 754; Nat. Phys. 2025, 21, 760], utilizing density functional theory, Wannier function analyses, Monte Carlo simulations, and non-equilibrium Green function methods. Intercalation induces room-temperature intralayer ferrimagnetic and interlayer ferromagnetic order (358 K for Li-intercalation and 773 K for V-intercalation), ferroelasticity (~1 % signal intensity), in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and metallization, while also modifying the anomalous Hall effect. Notably, Li- and V-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers exhibit enhanced spin splitting and half-metallic behavior, respectively, yielding near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Intercalation substantially enhances spin transport in V2Se2O-based devices, enabling giant magnetoresistance (877 %), ultra-high thermal tunneling magnetoresistance (~12000 %), and observable spin Seebeck and temperature negative differential resistance effects. This intercalation-driven paradigm expands altermagnetic functionalities through multifunctional integration, offering promising avenues for advanced, miniaturized, room-temperature exploitation of anomalous, electron, and spin transport properties.

Structural optimizations were performed using both the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The mechanical stability of LAGO was confirmed through the Born--Huang criteria, and key elastic constants (C11, C12, C33, C44, and C66) were evaluated. These constants were further used to derive mechanical parameters such as Young's modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, Cauchy's pressure, and anisotropic factor, offering insights into the material's ductility, hardness, and elastic anisotropy. Crucially, we explored the influence of biaxial strain on the electronic band structure, DOS/PDOS, and Fermi energy, revealing significant band gap modulation under compressive and tensile strain, and hence, varying the optical properties.
