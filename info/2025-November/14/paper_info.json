    "title": "Systematic validation of time-resolved diffuse optical simulators via non-contact SPAD-based measurements",
    "abstract": "           Objective: Time-domain diffuse optical imaging (DOI) requires accurate forward models for photon propagation in scattering media. However, existing simulators lack comprehensive experimental validation, especially for non-contact configurations with oblique illumination. This study rigorously evaluates three widely used open-source simulators, including MMC, NIRFASTer, and Toast++, using time-resolved experimental data. Approach: All simulations employed a unified mesh and point-source illumination. Virtual source correction was applied to FEM solvers for oblique incidence. A time-resolved DOI system with a 32 $\\times$ 32 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array acquired transmission-mode data from 16 standardized phantoms with varying absorption coefficient $\\mu_a$ and reduced scattering coefficient $\\mu_s'$. The simulation results were quantified across five metrics: spatial-domain (SD) precision, time-domain (TD) precision, oblique beam accuracy, computational speed, and mesh-density independence. Results: Among three simulators, MMC achieves superior accuracy in SD and TD metrics, and shows robustness across all optical properties. NIRFASTer and Toast++ demonstrate comparable overall performance. In general, MMC is optimal for accuracy-critical TD-DOI applications, while NIRFASTer and Toast++ suit scenarios prioritizing speed with sufficiently large $\\mu_s'$. Besides, virtual source correction is essential for non-contact FEM modeling, which reduced average errors by > 34% in large-angle scenarios. Significance: This work provides benchmarked guidelines for simulator selection during the development phase of next-generation TD-DOI systems. Our work represents the first study to systematically validate TD simulators against SPAD array-based data under clinically relevant non-contact conditions, bridging a critical gap in biomedical optical simulation standards.

    "abstract": "           We present a quantum linear response (qLR) approach within an active-space framework for computing indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants, a key ingredient in NMR spectra predictions. The method employs the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz and its orbital-optimized variant (ooUCC), both suitable for quantum computing implementations, to evaluate spin-spin coupling constants via qLR. Test calculations on five small molecules are compared with CASCI, CASSCF, and conventional CCSD results. qLR with UCC/ooUCC yields spin-spin coupling constants comparable to classical methods. We further examine the role of orbital optimization and find that ooUCC markedly affects the computed couplings; orbital-optimized results show better agreement with CCSD. These findings indicate that orbital optimization is important for accurate NMR coupling predictions within quantum-computing-friendly correlated methods.         ",

Similar to geometry-dependent plasmon and Mie resonances, these intrinsic material resonances offer coherent and tunable light scattering. Thus far, the impact of the excitons temporal dynamics on the performance of such excitonic metasurfaces remains unexplored. Here, we show how the excitonic decay rates dictate the focusing efficiency of an atomically-thin lens carved directly out of exfoliated monolayer WS2. By isolating the coherent exciton radiation from the incoherent background in the focus of the lens, we obtain a direct measure of the role of exciton radiation in wavefront shaping. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of exciton-phonon scattering by characterizing the focusing efficiency as a function of temperature, demonstrating an increased optical efficiency at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide valuable insights in the role of excitonic light scattering in 2D nanophotonic devices.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum phase imaging enables the analysis of transparent samples with thickness and refractive index variations in scenarios requiring precise measurements under low-light conditions. Recent advances in nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact solutions for quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we present a compact quantum phase imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup. In addition, theoretically, it is confirmed that the resolution of the system is primarily limited by the quality factor of the compact design, leveraging nonlocal resonances and quantum correlations, establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR. This work highlights the application of metasurface in both generating and detecting quantum states.         ",

    "abstract": "           Spectrally selective absorbers that maximize solar absorption and minimize thermal radiation loss are crucial for efficient solar thermal energy harvesting. However, limitations imposed by the intrinsic properties of conventional materials hinder the fabrication of interference-based absorbers with desired optical properties. Herein, a high-performance solar absorber with a Dallenbach-type dielectric-metal tandem structure was fabricated using an ultrathin, subquarter-wavelength thickness single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) membrane with tailored optical spectra as the absorbing layer. By mixing multiple SWCNT chiral structures, the optical response of the absorbing layer was tailored to approximate a theoretical complex refractive index spectrum of dielectrics; therefore enabling high solar absorptance, low infrared emittance, and a low angular dependence with a simple bilayer structure. The fabricated proof-of-concept 1 cm$^2$ absorber exhibited excellent spectral selectivity (solar absorptance/infrared emittance of 0.84/0.03), and an equilibrium temperature of $\\approx 190^\\circ$C ($270^\\circ$C) under nonconcentrated ($2\\times$ concentrated) sunlight, considerably outperformed a blackbody-like absorber. This study presents a high-performance solar absorber with a simple planar structure and proposes a concept of designing dielectric with the desired optical properties by mixing various types of structure-sorted SWCNTs.

This framework combines analytical models of spatiotemporal plasma wakefield modulation, phase-dependent RF-driven oscillations, and quantum-corrected Landau Lifshitz radiation reaction with fully self-consistent 3D particle in cell simulations using EPOCH. The results demonstrate that RF amplitude, frequency, and phase enable precise control over transverse focusing strengths, betatron oscillation amplitudes, and polarization states. Resonant alignment between RF fields and natural betatron frequencies amplifies transverse excursions while damping parasitic oscillations through enhanced focusing gradients and radiation reaction, yielding reductions in emittance and mitigation of synchrotron-like energy losses. Stability maps and 3D force landscapes reveal strong phase sensitivity, where initial conditions and RF component ratios govern the temporal evolution of betatron amplitudes, and longitudinal field gradients modulate {\\gamma} growth rates.

    "abstract": "           Understanding how laser pulses compress solids into high-energy-density states requires diagnostics that simultaneously resolve macroscopic geometry and nanometer-scale structure. Here we present a combined X-ray imaging (XRM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) approach that bridges this diagnostic gap. Using the Matter in Extreme Conditions end station at LCLS, we irradiated 25-micrometer copper wires with 45-fs, 0.9-J, 800-nm pulses at 3.5e19 W/cm2 while probing with 8.2-keV XFEL pulses. XRM visualizes the evolution of ablation, compression, and inward-propagating fronts with about 200-nm resolution, while SAXS quantifies their nanometer-scale sharpness through the time-resolved evolution of scattering streaks. The joint analysis reveals that an initially smooth compression steepens into a nanometer-sharp shock front after roughly 18 ps, consistent with an analytical steepening model and hydrodynamic simulations. The front reaches a velocity of about 25 km/s and a lateral width of several tens of micrometers, demonstrating for the first time the direct observation of shock formation and decay at solid density with few-nanometer precision. This integrated XRM-SAXS method establishes a quantitative, multiscale diagnostic of laser-driven shocks in dense plasmas relevant to inertial confinement fusion, warm dense matter, and planetary physics.

    "abstract": "           Optical matter (OM), composed of optically bound metallic particles, can be rotated by transferring the spin angular momentum (SAM) of chiral light to the assembly. Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions.

In addition, a repetitive acquisition protocol was designed to visualize intra-tissue activities (i.e., dynamic OCT imaging).

These capabilities enable enhanced optical performance and are essential for meeting non-optical constraints, such as those imposed by ergonomics, aerodynamics, or wearability. However, existing fabrication techniques such as direct electron or laser beam writing on curved substrates, and soft-stamp-based transfer or nanoimprint lithography suffer from limitations in scalability, yield, geometry control, and alignment accuracy. Here, we present a scalable fabrication strategy for curved and conformal metasurface optics leveraging thermoforming, an industry-standard, high-throughput manufacturing process widely used for shaping thermoplastics. Our approach uniquely enables wafer-scale production of highly curved metasurface optics, achieving sub-millimeter radii of curvature and micron-level alignment precision. To guide the design and fabrication process, we developed a thermorheological model that accurately predicts and compensates for the large strains induced during thermoforming. This allows for precise control of metasurface geometry and preservation of optical function, yielding devices with diffraction-limited performance. As a demonstration, we implemented an artificial compound eye comprising freeform micro-metalens arrays. Compared to traditional micro-optical counterparts, the device exhibits an expanded field of view, reduced aberrations, and improved uniformity, highlighting the potential of thermoformed metasurfaces for next-generation optical systems.

In standard QPF, the output state has a primary contribution from $r$ high-probability bit strings, where $r$ is the period. Measurement of this state, combined with continued fraction analysis, reveals the unknown period. Here, we explore a different approach to QPF, where the period is obtained from single-qubit quantities $-$ specifically, the set of one-qubit reduced density matrices (1-RDMs) $-$ rather than the output bit strings of the entire quantum circuit. Using state-vector simulations, we compute the 1-RDMs of the QPF circuit for a generic periodic function. Analysis of these 1-RDMs as a function of period reveals distinctive patterns, which allows us to obtain the unknown period from the 1-RDMs using a numerical root-finding approach. Our results show that the 1-RDMs $-$ a set of $O(n)$ one-qubit marginals $-$ contain enough information to reconstruct the period, which is typically obtained by sampling the space of $O(2^n)$ bit strings. Conceptually, this can be viewed as a \"compression\" of the information in the QPF algorithm, which enables period-finding from $n$ one-qubit marginals.

    "abstract": "           Inverse problems in imaging are typically ill-posed and are usually solved by employing regularized optimization techniques. The usage of appropriate constraints can restrict the solution space, thus making it feasible for a reconstruction algorithm to find a meaningful solution. In recent years, deep network based ideas aimed at learning the end-to-end mapping between the raw measurements and the target image have gained popularity. In the learning approach, the functional relationship between the measured raw data and the solution image are learned by training a deep network with prior examples. While this approach allows one to significantly increase the real-time operational speed, it does not change the nature of the underlying ill-posed inverse problem. It is well-known that availability of diverse non-redundant data via additional measurements can generically improve the robustness of the reconstruction algorithms. The multiple data measurements, however, typically demand additional hardware and complex system setups that are not desirable. In this work, we note that in both incoherent and coherent optical imaging, the irradiance patterns corresponding to two phase diverse measurements associated with the same test object have implicit local correlation which may be learned. A physics informed data augmentation scheme is then described where a trained network is used for generating a phase diverse pseudo-data based on a ground truth data frame. The true data along with the augmented pesudo-data are observed to provide high quality inverse solutions with simpler reconstruction algorithms. We validate this approach for both incoherent and coherent optical imaging (or phase retrieval) configurations with vortex phase as a diversity mechanism. Our results may open new avenues for leaner high-fidelity computational imaging systems across a broad range of applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           This paper will deal with isolated laser pulses, those which last for a finite time interval and whose envelope function is strictly zero outside of this interval. We numerically calculate the Fourier transform of this function and study its asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. This work is motivated by recent results on the probability distributions of quadratic operators in second quantized systems. An example is the density of a material which is subject to zero point fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. These distributions can decrease very slowly, leading to a relatively high probability for large fluctuations. If the operator is measured by a laser pulse, the rate of decrease of the distribution mirrors the rate of decrease of the pulse envelope Fourier transform. We describe a model for the creation of isolated pulses in which this Fourier transform falls as an exponential of a fractional power of frequency and find examples where this fraction is in the range 0.1 to 0.2. The probability distribution for large fluctuation has the same functional form and implies a significant probability for fluctuations very large compared to the variance.         ",

The findings reveal how increased NIR laser power correlates with alterations in ODMR central frequency but also that charge state dynamics under NIR irradiation of NV centers plays a role.

Here we test MCS sensitivity to spatial scales of surface heterogeneity using a framework of 78 Unified Model experiments initialised from scale-filtered SM. We demonstrate the control of SM heterogeneity on MCS populations, and the mechanistic chain via which spatial variability propagates through surface fluxes to convective boundary layer development and storm environments. When all sub-synoptic SM variability is homogenised, peak MCS counts drop by 23%, whereas maintaining small-scale variability maintains primary initiation rates, reducing the drop in MCS totals. In sensitivity experiments, boundary layer development prior to MCSs is similar to that over mesoscale dry SM anomalies, but driven by cloud-free slots of increased shortwave radiation.

Here we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that introducing a thermally tunable auxiliary microresonator extends the bandwidth of SIL soliton microcombs. By engineering hybridization of the pumped resonance, we achieve deterministic access to single soliton states and then push operation into a far detuned regime inaccessible to direct initiation. The resulting combs reach a near 200 nm span at a 25 GHz repetition rate, while preserving the SIL-enabled noise suppression throughout. Moreover, the added degree of freedom afforded by the coupled resonator architecture enables orthogonal control of the comb's repetition rate and center frequency.

Using a reduced basis method, we construct powerful emulators for the inhomogeneous Schr\u00f6dinger equation that operate in a combined parameter space of complex energy ($E$) and other inputs ($\\bm{\\theta}$). Within the space, the emulators simultaneously perform analytical continuation in $E$ -- extracting continuum physics from numerically simpler bound-state-like calculations -- and interpolate this entire process across $\\bm{\\theta}$. This yields a small, non-Hermitian system whose properties (e.g., resonances and scattering observables) can be rapidly predicted for any $\\bm{\\theta}$. Crucially, the complex-$E$ emulation provides a pathway to compute continuum observables for complex systems where advanced bound-state methods exist but direct continuum calculations are yet to be developed, while the $\\bm{\\theta}$-emulation enables rapid parameter-space exploration and can be adapted to accelerate other existing continuum calculations. Demonstrations with two- and three-body systems highlight the method's effectiveness and suggest its connection to (near-)optimal rational approximation.

Significant strides have been recently made into building better `quantum mixers', with promise being shown by Kerr-free three-wave mixers that suppress driven frequency shifts, and balanced quantum mixers that explicitly forbid a significant fraction of parasitic processes. We propose a novel mixer that combines both these strengths, with engineered selection rules that make it essentially linear (not just Kerr-free) when idle, and activate clean parametric processes even when driven at high strength. Further, its ideal Hamiltonian is simple to analyze analytically, and we show that this ideal behavior is first-order insensitive to dominant experimental imperfections.

By appropriately selecting the quantum state encoding, circuit architecture, and measurement protocol, non-unitary dynamics emerge naturally within the physical population space. This approach removes the need for probabilistic algorithms relying on any ancilla qubits and post-selection to reproduce dissipation, or for multiple state copies to capture nonlinearity. The SQC is designed to preserve key physical properties of the BGK operator, including mass conservation, scale equivariance, and D8 equivariance, while momentum conservation is encouraged through penalization in the training loss. When compiled to the IBM Heron quantum processor's native gate set, assuming all-to-all qubit connectivity, the circuit requires only 724 native gates and operates locally on the velocity register, making it independent of the lattice size. The learned SQC is validated on two benchmark cases, the Taylor-Green vortex decay and the lid-driven cavity, showing accurate reproduction of vortex decay and flow recirculation. While integration of the SQC into a quantum LBM framework presently requires measurement and re-initialization at each timestep, the necessary steps towards a measurement-free formulation are outlined.

    "title": "Quantum synchronization between two strongly driven YIG spheres mediated via a microwave cavity",
    "abstract": "           We present a theoretical study of synchronization between two strongly driven magnon modes indirectly coupled via a single-mode microwave cavity. Each magnon mode, hosted in separate Yttrium Iron Garnet spheres, interacts coherently with the cavity field, leading to cavity-mediated nonlinear coupling. We show, by using input-output formalism, that both classical and quantum synchronization emerge for appropriate choices of coupling, detuning, and driving. We find that thermal noise reduces quantum synchronization, highlighting the importance of low-temperature conditions. This study provides useful insights into tunable magnonic interactions in cavity systems, with possible applications in quantum information processing and hybrid quantum technologies.         ",

    "title": "Bistability of optical properties of cesium vapor due to collective interaction of alignment and orientation under strong spin exchange conditions",
    "abstract": "           Hydrogen-like alkali atoms with a single valence electron are the most common objects in quantum optics and, at the same time, serve as essential tools of the field. Under conditions of optical pumping, strong spin-exchange and ultra-weak magnetic field (spin-exchange relaxation free mode, SERF), ensembles of such atoms in the gas phase can demonstrate not only the absence of spin-exchange relaxation, but also nonlinear collective effects. We present experimental evidence that the alignment, i.e. the quadrupole momentum, can not only be preserved under SERF conditions, but also coexist and interact with the orientation, i.e. the dipole momentum. We also show that this interaction leads to bistability: a small change in conditions can cause the medium to transition to a different steady state, an effect characterized by hysteresis. The combination of properties of this effect opens up a wide range of applications as optical keys or memory elements with a storage time of hundreds of seconds in tasks of quantum information and cryptography.
