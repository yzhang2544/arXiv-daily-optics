    "abstract": "           Thermalization of isolated quantum systems is an intriguing phenomenon at the forefront of contemporary physics. In this work, we demonstrate that nonlinear multimode optical platforms can be harnessed to induce effective quantum interactions between photons. Through numerical experiments where quantum beams propagate alongside classical light within multimode nonlinear optical systems, we reveal the thermalization of fundamental quantum light states--specifically single- and two-photon states. This thermalization is clearly manifested by the emergence of Rayleigh-Jeans and Boltzmann statistical distributions. Beyond providing a deeper understanding of how classical nonlinearities can be used to investigate quantum many-body dynamics, our findings will enable the exploration of a broader range of complex quantum phenomena, including aspects of quantum phase transitions, within readily accessible classical optical settings.

Multi-layer metasurfaces (MLM) offer unprecedented degrees of freedom for efficient light manipulation beyond conventional single-material metasurfaces, enabling dual-resonance cavities that can simultaneously enhance pump excitation and SPE collection. However, traditional trial-and-error and forward optimization methods face significant challenges in designing these complex structures due to the vast parameter space and computational demands. Here, we present NanoPhotoNet-Inverse, an artificial intelligence-driven inverse design framework based on a hybrid deep neural network architecture. This model efficiently performs inverse design of two dual-resonance MLM cavities to amplify pump and SPE emissions of different vacancies in nanodiamond and improve SPE collection. Our approach achieves inverse design prediction efficiency exceeding 98.7%, demonstrating three orders of magnitude amplification in SPE count rate and 50 picosecond lifetime, significantly surpassing conventional cavity designs. These remarkable enhancements in emission rates and collection efficiency position our platform as a transformative technology for advancing quantum communication networks, quantum computing architectures, quantum sensing applications, and quantum cryptography systems. Therefore, it opens new pathways for intelligent photonic device engineering in quantum technologies.         ",

Through co-optimized low-noise electronic and probe design, the system effectively suppresses both intrinsic sensor common-mode drift and external environmental magnetic noise, enabling high signal-to-noise ratio detection of nono-tesla to micro-tesla-level magnetic signals without magnetic shielding. Experimental results demonstrate that the differential system achieves significantly lower noise spectral density in unshielded environments compared to conventional GMI sensors (\\SI{46}{pT}/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ versus \\SI{286}{pT}/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ at \\SI{1}{Hz}), with a sensitivity of 186,790 V/T and spatial resolution better than 200 micrometers. The system's excellent performance in weak magnetic field detection and spatial resolution was verified through scanning experiments of magnetic ink on US banknotes and magnetic reference samples. Compared to SQUID scanning systems, which requiring liquid helium cooling, this system based on the GMI effect offers advantages of room-temperature operation, compact structure, and low cost. Relative to conventional single-element GMI microscopes, it achieves significant improvements in signal-to-noise ratio and environmental adaptability.

Yet, systematic studies of its thickness-dependent reflectivity and its impact on harmonic generation are still lacking. Here, we introduce a non-destructive optical method to determine the thickness of 3r-MoS2 flakes from reflectivity measurements, offering AFM-like precision with a mean bias of less than 2 nm range, while being much faster and applicable to non-solid substrates such as PDMS, in the 3-200 nm range. Nonlinear characterization further reveals distinct thickness-dependent maxima in second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG), with the first clear peak at ~200 nm. These maxima arise from Fabry-P\u00e9rot-type phase matching conditions mediated by the film thickness and can further be shaped by absorption.

The structure and properties of these halide-based solid electrolytes (HSE) can be tuned by alloying, e.g. using different halides and/or transition metals simultaneously. The large chemical space is difficult to sample by experiments, making simulations based on broadly applicable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) a promising approach to elucidate structure-property relations, and facilitate the design of better-performing compositions. Here we focus on the Li$_3$YCl$_{6x}$Br$_{6(1-x)}$ system, for which reliable experimental data exists, and use the recently-developed PET-MAD universal MLIP to investigate the structure of the alloy, the interplay of crystalline lattice, volume and chemical composition, and its effect on Li conductivity. We find that the distribution of Cl and Br atoms is only weakly correlated, and that the primary effect of alloying is to modulate the lattice parameter -- although it can also trigger transition between different lattice symmetries. By comparing constant-volume and constant-pressure simulations, we disentangle the effect of lattice parameter and chemical composition on the conductivity, finding that the two effects compensate each other, reducing the overall dependency of conductivity on alloy composition. We also study the effect of Y-In metal substitution finding a small increase in the conductivity for the C2/m phase at 25\\% In content, and an overall higher conductivity for the P$\\bar{3}$m1 phase.

Here, we address this challenge by generating common-cavity bi-color Brillouin lasers as the optical frequency references, which operate at the fundamental quantum noise limit with Schawlow-Townes linewidth on the 10 {\\mu}Hz level.

    "abstract": "           Plasmonic Optical matter (OM), composed of optically bound metallic particles, can be rotated by transferring the spin angular momentum (SAM) of chiral light to the assembly. Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions.

However, unavoidable interradical interactions, such as electron-electron dipolar and exchange couplings, alongside deleterious perturbations resulting from intrinsic radical motion, typically degrade their potential as magnetometers. In contrast to this, we show how structured molecular motion modulating interradical interactions in a live chemical sensor in cryptochrome can, in fact, increase sensitivity and, more so, push precision in estimating magnetic field directions closer to the quantum Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound, suggesting near-optimal metrological performance. Remarkably, this approach to optimality is amplified under environmental noise and persists with increasing complexity of the spin system, suggesting that perturbations inherent to such natural systems have enabled them to operate closer to the quantum limit to more effectively extract information from the weak geomagnetic field.

    "title": "Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation",
    "abstract": "           We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.         ",

    "title": "Kerr Black Hole Shadows in Dispersive Plasma: Frequency-Dependent Geodesics and Shadow Distortions",
    "abstract": "           The black hole shadow, a direct probe of the event horizon's gravitational influence, has been observationally confirmed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). While theoretical models of shadows in vacuum are mature, real astrophysical black holes like M87* and Sgr A* are enveloped in plasma, which can alter photon trajectories through dispersion. Current understanding, based on foundational work, indicates that only specific plasma distributions allow for an analytical treatment via the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we build upon this framework to systematically investigate the propagation of light rays in Kerr spacetime surrounded by a pressureless, non-magnetized cold plasma. We explicitly derive the separability condition, identifying the exact class of plasma densities that permit a generalized Carter constant. For these models, we compute the photon regions and shadow boundaries, characterizing how the shadow's size and shape deviate from the vacuum case in a frequency-dependent manner. Our results provide analytical benchmarks for the distortion of shadows in dispersive media and determine the critical plasma frequency beyond which the shadow is erased, offering a direct link between observable shadow features and the properties of the ambient plasma environment and providing a foundation for studying more dynamic, non-separable plasma distributions.
