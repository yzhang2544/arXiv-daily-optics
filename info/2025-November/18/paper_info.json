This report presents a framework for the categorization of roles in the QISE industry based on 42 interviews of QISE professionals across 23 companies, as well as a description of the method used in the creation of this framework. The data included information on over 80 positions, which we have grouped into 29 roles spanning four primary categories. For each primary category we provide an overview of what unites the roles within a category, a description of relevant subcategories, and definitions of the individual roles. These roles serve as the basis upon which we generate profiles of these roles, which include information about role critical tasks, necessary knowledge and skills, and educational requirements. Our next report will present such profiles for each of the roles presented herein.         ",

    "abstract": "           In flexible-grid elastic optical networks (EONs), the ordering of frequency channels plays a crucial role in managing inter-channel interference and ensuring signal quality. We address the Channel Ordering Problem (COP) by reformulating it as a Bottleneck Traveling Salesman Problem (BTSP), where interference among channels is represented as edge weights in a graph structure. To tackle this challenge efficiently, we develop a scalable approach that integrates statistical exploration with guidance from large language models (LLMs). Extensive simulations using both the Gaussian Noise (GN) model and the split-step Fourier method demonstrate that our method achieves near-optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance and offers robust scalability across diverse network settings, making it well-suited for practical deployment in large-scale optical communication systems.

    "abstract": "           Multistability -- the emergence of multiple stable states under identical conditions -- is a hallmark of nonlinear complexity and an enabling mechanism for multilevel optical memory and photonic computing. Its realization in a compact footprint, however, is limited by intrinsically weak optical nonlinearities and the enlarged free spectral range that raises the multistability threshold. Here, we overcome this constraint by engineering a pair of spectrally close, ultra-high-Q resonances in a photonic crystal microcavity. Leveraging structural perturbations that deliberately introduce non-Hermitian coupling through a shared radiation channel, we drive the resonances toward an exceptional point with nearly degenerate wavelengths and balanced quality factors approaching $10^6$. This configuration substantially enhances thermo-optical nonlinearity and produces pronounced tristability and hysteresis loops within a footprint of 20 {\\mu}m at input powers below 240 {\\mu}W. We further demonstrate proof-of-concept optical random-access memory through controlled switching among multistable states. These results establish a general strategy for nonlinear microcavities to achieve energy-efficient multistability for reconfigurable all-optical memories, logic, and neuromorphic processors.

    "abstract": "           Strong light-matter interactions in silicon metasurfaces give rise to photothermal nonlinearities. While the effect of this strong coupling on light has been extensively studied, its impact on matter remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate photothermal energy harvesting using strong light-matter interactions in high-quality-factor metasurfaces. First, we show that maximum metasurface temperatures can differ by $90^\\circ C$ based on the spectral excitation pathway: direct excitation of the metasurface from its nominal equilibrium by a single wavelength results in lower metasurface temperatures compared to continuous spectral scans. Investigating the temporal dynamics of this thermo-optic nonlinearity, we show an initial linear rise to a critical temperature over $~10s$ of seconds, followed by a rapid rise to the high temperature steady state in $~33ms$ around the bistable transition point. This linear rise time increases sharply around the bistable transition point. Most significantly, we show emergence of a Q-factor-dependent temperature band splitting and energy gap of around $60^\\circ C$ between the critical temperature and the high temperature steady state of the metasurface under single wavelength illumination. This forbidden equilibrium temperature band signifies that the high temperature steady state of the metasurface resonance after transitioning across the laser wavelength is further away from its nominal resonance than its linewidth. Interestingly, hyperspectrally accumulated nonlinearities from prior wavelengths effectively dope the metasurface with optical states within this bandgap. These thermal nonlinearities are tunable using the geometry and material of the metasurface. Collectively, these results show how high-Q metasurfaces enable strongly localized, path-dependent photothermal heating to drive site-selective on-chip catalytic and biochemical transformations.

    "abstract": "           Non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanics (CMM), which incorporates the magnon-photon and magnon-phonon interactions simultaneously, enables rich physical phenomena, including exceptional-point-enhanced sensing, and offers pathways toward topological transitions and nonreciprocal quantum transformation. These interactions exert a pivotal influence on the optical response of a weak probe field and pave the way for novel applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we consider a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere coupled to a microwave cavity. The magnon mode of the YIG sphere is directly excited through microwave field coupling, whereas the cavity mode is probed via a weak-field interrogation scheme. The direct interaction of a traveling field with the magnon mode induces gain in the system, thereby establishing non-Hermitian dynamics. The parity-time (PT)-symmetric behavior of a hybrid non-Hermitian CMM is designed and investigated. Eigenvalue spectrum analysis demonstrates that a third-order exceptional point (EP_3) emerges under tunable effective magnon-photon coupling when the traveling field is oriented at an angle of \\pi/2 relative to the cavity's x-axis. The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in a reflected probe field is subsequently examined in such a system. Under balanced gain and loss conditions and in the presence of effective magnon-phonon coupling, tunable effective magnon-photon coupling enables coherent control of the PSHE across the broken PT-symmetric phase, at the EP_3, and in the PT-symmetric phase. Investigation reveals that the PSHE can be significantly enhanced or suppressed via effective magnon-photon coupling. The influence of intracavity length on the PSHE is further explored, providing an additional parameter for fine-tuning the transverse shift. These findings establish a direct correspondence between the PSHE and the underlying non-Hermitian eigenvalue spectrum.         ",

Time-resolved RIXS extends this capability through a stroboscopic optical pump-probe scheme to characterize the time evolution of the photoexcitation and subsequent relaxation dynamics of a sample. This technique is, however, extremely photon-hungry, requiring high-repetition-rate and intense X-ray facilities. The Heisenberg RIXS (hRIXS) spectrometer at the Spectroscopy and Coherent Scattering (SCS) instrument of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL) is designed to exploit high-repetition-rates, while maintaining optimal time and energy resolution. In this work, we demonstrate the successful deployment of a JUNGFRAU detector equipped with an inverse Low Gain Avalanche Diode (iLGAD) sensor for time-resolved RIXS studies in the soft X-ray range, using the hRIXS spectrometer. A spatial resolution of $19.71 \\pm 0.7~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and a resolving power exceeding 10,000 were achieved at an unprecedented frame rate of 47 kHz. Intra-train resolved data measured with a high FEL peak fluence of $1.8~\\mathrm{mJ/cm^{2}}$ for a 928.5 eV ph photon energy and 1.1 MHz repetition rate from cupric oxide (CuO) revealed a decrease in the emitted signal by ~10% over a time interval of $340~\\mu\\mathrm{s}$, indicating FEL-induced effects that require monitoring when conducting high-repetition-rate experiments. These results establish the JUNGFRAU-iLGAD as a promising detector to harvest the full potential of the hRIXS spectrometer, and validate its suitability for soft X-ray applications.         ",

Integration of lithium niobate into optical devices, however, is hampered by significant top-down fabrication challenges due to its exceptional chemical resistance. Scalable fabrication methods that preserve material quality while reducing fabrication complexity and cost are, therefore, crucial to advancing lithium niobate devices. We present a photochemical metal-organic decomposition technique for the scalable patterning of lithium niobate at ambient conditions, eliminating the need for harsh etching conditions and cleanroom protocols. The method utilizes a solution of a custom-prepared photosensitive organometallic precursor as a negative photoresist. The UV light exposure of the thin films of the precursor through a photomask, followed by rinsing with ethanol, yields amorphous patterns, which transform into crystalline lithium niobate after a calcination step. This method enables a scalable fabrication of a range of complex geometric shapes with a feature resolution down to $30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The patterned lithium niobate structures exhibit a tunable second harmonic generation activity with an isotropic optical response. This approach offers a scalable and low-cost pathway for manufacturing lithium niobate photonics and the potential to fabricate other materials (e.g., barium titanite and lithium tantalate).

This study presents a differentiable inverse design framework for such metasurfaces, creating an accurate mapping between meta-atom geometries and their multi-channel optical responses across diverse optical dimensions. Using a deep neural network-driven, end-to-end optimization pipeline, the framework enables intelligent, iterative refinement of rotatable metasurface within constrained design space. Using this approach, we show high-fidelity holographic video display by rotating a single element in a cascaded metasurface doublet around the optical axis. The doublet enables pixel-resolved holographic imaging with 288 independent channels, and by switching input/output polarization states, the system demonstrates four distinct full-color dynamic holographic videos. This work establishes an alternative paradigm for optical parameter multiplexing and end-to-end inverse design in mechanically reconfigurable metasurfaces, suggesting applications in compact optical systems, dynamic holography, information processing, and optical computing.

    "abstract": "           Exponential parallelism, a defining principle of advanced computational systems, holds promise for transformative impacts across several scientific and industrial domains. This feature paper provides a comparative overview of Quantum Computing (QC) and Instantaneous Noise-based Logic (INBL), focusing on their practical strengths, limitations, and applications rather than exhaustive technical depth. Both paradigms leverage exponentially large Hilbert spaces: quantum computing achieves this via quantum superposition, while INBL realizes it through the product space of classical noise processes. Quantum computers attain universality for all computational operations, whereas current INBL frameworks are universal only for Boolean logic; notably, essential superposition operations-such as AND and OR gates-are absent, precluding implementations of algorithms like Shor's. However, for certain problem classes where full universality is not required, INBL and quantum computing can offer equivalent time and hardware complexity, as observed with the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. Remarkably, for search tasks such as phonebook lookup, Grover's quantum algorithm provides a quadratic O(n^0.5) speedup compared to the classical approach, while INBL achieves an exponential speedup, requiring only logarithmic time in the size n of the phonebook O(log n). Such INBL algorithms could, in principle, be adapted to quantum hardware to attain similar performance. Importantly, INBL hardware is considerably simpler, being implementable with modest modifications to conventional PC architectures equipped with a true random number generator, and it inherently avoids the decoherence and error correction challenges of quantum systems.

In this work, we develop a staged-annealing topological optimization (SATO) framework tailored for the design of integrated terahertz (THz) beam-shaping devices. Employing this inverse-designed framework, we experimentally demonstrate a class of compact THz vortex beam emitters on an all-silicon on-chip platform.

However, achieving precise control over the emission and disentangling the complex interplay between intraband and interband quantum pathways remains a central challenge. Here, we demonstrate through first-principles simulations that HHG in monolayer WS2 can be subjected to precise, complementary control by combining all-optical two-color laser fields with mechanical strain engineering. This dual-mode strategy provides unprecedented, orthogonal control over harmonic yield, polarization, and spectral features. We reveal that sculpting the two-color field's relative phase provides a sub-femtosecond switch for the quantum coherence of electron-hole pairs, thereby maximizing harmonic emission. Crucially, we uncover that tensile strain acts as a powerful amplifier through a dual mechanism - while strain-modified band dispersion enhances the intraband current, a profound reshaping of the Berry curvature (BC) dramatically boosts the anomalous velocity contribution to the interband response. This quantum geometric effect manifests as a robust, linear dependence of the harmonic yield on strain and a significant amplification of the perpendicularly polarized harmonics, providing a clear experimental signature for probing quantum geometric effects. Our findings establish a versatile framework for optimizing solid-state HHG and introduce a powerful all-optical method to map strain and quantum geometric properties of materials, positioning monolayer WS2 as a model system for exploring attosecond physics at the nexus of bulk and atomic scales.

Our general-purpose photonic Ising machine paves the way for implementing large-scale, programmable architectures for solving optimization problems.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present a comprehensive study of spin relaxation dynamics at cryogenic temperatures in a rare-earth-doped crystal used for quantum memory applications: $^{171}$Yb:Y$_2$SiO$_5$. Spin relaxation is indeed a major limiting factor for both the efficiency and storage time of quantum memory protocols based on atomic frequency combs in rare-earth materials. The relaxation dynamics among the four ground-state hyperfine levels were simultaneously investigated by optically perturbing the spin population distribution and monitoring its return to thermal equilibrium through optical absorption spectroscopy. By applying different types of perturbations, we were also able to distinguish between two types of relaxation processes, induced by spin-phonon and spin-spin interactions. Below 1 K, we observed that the re-thermalization of the Yb$^{3+}$ ion population takes several hours, driven solely by direct phonon absorption or emission. However, the effective lifetime of individual spin states is much shorter - on the order of several seconds in low-doped (2 ppm) samples and of milliseconds in 10 ppm samples - due to spin-spin interactions. These findings provide valuable guidelines for optimizing doping levels and operating temperatures in rare-earth-doped crystals for quantum applications. Notably, they suggest that atomic frequency combs with lifetimes of several hours could be realized using $^{171}$Yb:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals with slightly less than 2 ppm doping and operating near 1 K.

Here, we report on the detection and quantification of both HNC and HCN isomers in low-temperature plasmas generated from N$_2$/H$_2$/CH$_4$ mixtures using quantum cascade laser and frequency comb absorption spectroscopy. The identification of HNC is confirmed by comparison with molecular spectroscopic databases. The observed [HNC]/[HCN] abundance ratio of $\\sim 10^{-4}$ is far lower than reported values in interstellar media, where ratios can reach unity. We attribute this stark difference to fundamentally different kinetics, dominated by an interplay between formation of vibrationally 'hot' intermediates (HCN* and HNC*) and their subsequent stabilization and destruction. This mechanism contrasts with cold interstellar environments, where dissociative recombination reactions dominate and the formed HNC persists and accumulates over astrochemical timescales. Our results highlight the overlooked role of HNC in plasma chemistry containing carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, with implications for plasma-assisted HCN synthesis and nitrogen-carbon plasma processes in surface modification and material treatments.

On-wafer noise characterization of cryogenic low-noise transistors is desirable because it facilitates more rapid characterization of devices prior to packaging, but obtaining accurate noise measurements is difficult due to the uncertainty arising from the input loss and temperature gradients prior to the device-under-test (DUT). Here, we report a calibration method that enables the simultaneous determination of the backend noise temperature and effective-noise-ratio at the input plane of the DUT. The method is based on measuring the S-parameters and noise power of a series of attenuators at two or more distinct physical temperatures. We validate our method by measuring the noise temperature of InP HEMTs in 4-8 GHz. The calibration method can be generalized to measure the microwave noise temperature of any two-port device so long as a series of attenuators can be measured at two or more distinct physical temperatures.

Our ZAPT2 frozen natural orbital (ZAPT-FNO) selection scheme significantly outperforms the canonical molecular orbital virtual space truncation scheme based on Hartree-Fock orbital energies, especially when using large multiple-polarized and augmented basis sets. We demonstrate that the ZAPT-FNO-selected virtual orbitals lead to a systematic convergence of the correlation energies, but more importantly to the singlet-triplet T$_1$-S$_ 0$ energy gaps with respect to the complete active space (CAS) [occupied + virtual] size. We confirm our findings by simulating T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps in H$_2$O$_2$ and O$_2$ molecules using the traditional complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) approach, as well as in stretched CH$_2$, for which we also employed the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method as a quantum eigensolver. Finally, we applied the iQCC method with ZAPT-FNO-selected active space to the phosphorescent Ir(ppy)$_3$ complex with 260 electrons, where extended basis sets are required to achieve chemical (ca. 1 m$E_h$) accuracy. In this case, CASCI results are not available; however, the iQCC-computed T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps show robust convergence with enlarging basis set and CAS size, approaching the experimental value. Thus, the ZAPT-FNO method is very promising for improving the accuracy of quantum chemical modelling in a resource-efficient manner, and opens the door to simulating open-shell states of large materials within realistic active space sizes and without compromising on basis-set quality.

The versatility of this in-situ growth method for single crystals on fiber end facets of various sizes has also been verified. In a separate approach, the controllable in-situ preparation of CsPbBr3 polycrystalline thin films was achieved through vacuum-assisted rapid crystallization. Our strategy provides a controllable platform for the integration of perovskite materials and optical fibers, enabling further development in optical applications.         ",

We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation. Overall, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a dual role-stabilizing skyrmionic qubits while simultaneously inducing decoherence during gate operations.         ",

Building upon previous research, the present study further investigates the termination of the approximation at an optimal spatial resolution, addressing the absence of higher frequencies in typical ear canal measurements and enhancing the accuracy of the inverse solution. Compared to the geometric reference, more precise area functions were achieved by extrapolating simulated input impedances of ear canal geometries up to a frequency of 3.5 MHz, corresponding to 0.1 mm spatial resolution. The low pass of the previous work was adopted but adjusted for its cut-off frequency depending on the highest frequency of the band-limited input impedance. Robust criteria for terminating the area function at the approximated ear canal length were found. Finally, three-dimensional simulated and measured ear canal transfer impedances were replicated well employing the previously introduced and herein validated one-dimensional electro-acoustic model fed by the area functions.

However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.

    "abstract": "           Frequency combs are multimode photonic systems that underlie countless precision sensing and metrology applications. Since their invention over two decades ago, numerous efforts have pushed frequency combs to broader bandwidths and more stable operation. More recently, quantum squeezing and entanglement have been explored in single frequency comb systems for quantum advantages in sensing and signal multiplexing. However, the production of quantum light across multiple frequency combs remains unexplored. In this work, we theoretically explore a mechanism that generates a series of nonlinearly coupled frequency combs through cascaded three-wave upconversion and downconversion processes mediated by a single idler comb. We show how this system generates inter- and intracomb two-mode squeezing and entanglement spanning a very large spectral range, from ultraviolet to mid-IR frequencies. Finally, we show how this system can be engineered to produce on-demand multimode quantum light through covariance matrix optimization. Our findings could enable tunable broadband ghost spectroscopy protocols, squeezing-enhanced pump-probe measurements, and broadband entanglement between spectrally-multiplexed quanta of information.

    "abstract": "           The random nature of spontaneous emission leads to unavoidable fluctuations in a laser's output. This is often included through random Langevin forces in laser rate equations, but this approach falls short for nanolasers. In this paper, we show that the laser quantum noise can be quantitatively computed for a very broad class of lasers by starting from simple and intuitive rate equations and merely assuming that the number of photons and excited electrons only takes discrete values. The success of the model is explained by showing that it constitutes a Markov chain, which can be derived from the full master equations. We show that in the many-photon limit, the model simplifies to Langevin equations. We perform an extensive comparison of different approaches for computing quantum noise in lasers, identifying the best approach for different system sizes, ranging from nanolasers to macroscopic lasers, and different levels of excitation, i.e., cavity photon number. In particular, we find that the numerical solution to the Langevin equations is inaccurate below the laser threshold, while the laser Markov chain model, on the other hand, is accurate for all pump values and laser sizes when collective emitter effects are excluded.

We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.         ",

I show the coherent quantum behavior persists at scales far beyond atoms and circuits: in Earth's (10^51) resonant geophysical cycles, manifesting astro-macroscopic time-crystalline behavior. Thus, based on arguably the most accurate and precise spectral analysis of the most accurate global geomagnetism calibration (CKGPTS95), macroscopic and microscopic phenomena are interconnected through gravitational resonance networks across the cosmos, annulling conventional views of quantum invariance. The analyses unveiled a planet-dominating 9.35-My fundamental cycle arising from Earth's orbital and stellar gravitational influences, which resonantly governs long-term geomagnetic reversals, planetary growth, stratigraphic anomalies that mimic periodic mass extinctions, and the Great Unconformity. The resonances exhibit non-geophysical features of quantum coherence classically confined to microscopic systems, such as time crystals: discrete time-translation symmetry, fractional harmonic locking, and many-body entrainment. Given the ubiquity of the tidal phenomenon, a resonance-based framework exists in which large-scale celestial dynamics calibrate quantum analogously to how extragalactic dynamics calibrate stellar - thereby constraining particle masses, coupling constants, and universal parameters. This data-driven proof completes my 2006 theoretical derivation of G (and thus gravity) from c at both quantum and everyday scales, and confirms the Hyperresonance Unifying Theory, which unified those domains using only high-school algebra arXiv:0801.0876.

This complexity makes it challenging to find and meet the conditions under which an analog optimization algorithm can be successful.

In particular, the B centres, with their narrow linewidth, low wavelength spread and controllable positioning, have raised a particular interest for integrated quantum photonics. However, to date, either their excitation or their detection has been performed non-resonantly due to the difficulty of rejecting the backreflected laser light at the same wavelength, thereby preventing to take full benefit from their high coherence in quantum protocols. Here, we make use of a narrow-linewidth emitter integrated in a hybrid metal-dielectric structure to implement crossed-polarisation laser rejection. This allows us to observe resonantly scattered photons, with associated experimental signatures of optical coherence in both continuous-wave (cw) and pulsed regimes, respectively the Mollow triplet and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference from zero-phonon-line emission. The measured two-photon interference visibility of 0.93 +/- 0.21 and 0.92 +/- 0.26 we measured for two emitters demonstrate the potential of B centres in hBN for applications to integrated quantum information.

We use a single trapped atomic ion, confined to approximately 40 nm X 40 nm X 180 nm to sense a laser light field at a wavelength of 370 nm. With its spatial extent smaller than the absorption cross-section of a resonant detector, the ion-sensor operates at the fundamental limit of spatial resolution. Our technique relies on developing an analytical model of the ion-light interaction and using the model to extract the intensity and polarization. An important insight provided in this work is also that the inverse of this model can be learned, in a restricted sense, on a deep neural network, speeding up the intensity and polarization readout by five orders of magnitude. This speed-up makes the technique field-deployable to characterize optical instruments by probing light at the sub-wavelength scale.         ",

To cope with these high rates in the pixel trackers, per-pixel time measurements are required, which implies the need for fast sensors. The inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) is one of the fast sensor options that is being investigated. This paper will show the results of an inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) with a pitch of 55 $\\mu$m, a thickness of 250~$\\mu$m and a large-area (2~cm$^2$), bump bonded to a Timepix4 ASIC. Timepix4 has 195~ps time binning on each pixel and therefore an excellent ASIC to test the sensor. The sensor is characterised with radio-active source measurements in the lab, and during beam test at the CERN SPS North Area H8 beamline, where the Timepix4 telescope was used. The telescope has a time reference of 12~ps and a pointing resolution of 2.4 $\\pm$ 0.1~$\\mu$m. The iLGAD shows an almost uniform gain of approximately 4 and an efficiency of 99.6 $\\pm$ 0.1\\%. Without any corrections the obtained time resolution is about 750~ps. After timewalk and clock corrections the time resolution becomes 377 $\\pm$ 7~ps. Grazing angle measurements have been done, which allow to measure the time resolution as function of depth of the charge deposition in the sensor. This provides more insight for the perpendicular time resolution.         ",

    "abstract": "           Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors built on photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) have recently become a promising category of optical sensing platforms. This is primarily due to their high sensitivity, compact structural design and ability to work with a wide variety of analytes. The overall sensing performance can significantly be enhanced by carefully tailoring the fiber geometry to strengthen the coupling between the guided core mode and the plasmon mode. This study designs and thoroughly investigates a polarization-dependent SPR-based PCF sensor that delivers strong mode coupling, wide detection range and high refractive-index (RI) sensitivity using finite element method (FEM). In the proposed configuration, air holes with different diameters and a rectangular core slot are used to create birefringence along with four outer microchannels coated with a 30 nm gold film create distinct plasmonic regions that support multiple resonances. The simulated results yield maximum wavelength sensitivities of 77500 $nmRIU^-{1}$ and 92500 $nmRIU^-{1}$, along with amplitude sensitivities of 3930 $RIU^-{1}$ and 3139 $RIU^-{1}$ and figures of merit of 517 $RIU^-{1}$ and 356 $RIU^-{1}$ for the x- and y-polarizations respectively, over an analyte RI range of 1.32-1.42. The parametric study verifies that the design is highly tolerant to fabrication deviations and the coupling behavior is primarily sensitive to the smallest air holes and the height of the core slot. Since the sensing region is external, analytes can be reused conveniently. Consequently, the proposed sensor provides a compact, highly sensitive and practically realizable platform for biochemical and chemical sensing applications.         ",

However, existing simulators lack comprehensive experimental validation, especially for non-contact configurations with oblique illumination. This study rigorously evaluates three widely used open-source simulators, including MMC, NIRFASTer, and Toast++, using time-resolved experimental data. Approach: All simulations employed a unified mesh and point-source illumination. Virtual source correction was applied to FEM solvers for oblique incidence. A time-resolved DOI system with a 32 $\\times$ 32 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array acquired transmission-mode data from 16 standardized phantoms with varying absorption coefficient $\\mu_a$ and reduced scattering coefficient $\\mu_s'$. The simulation results were quantified across five metrics: spatial-domain (SD) precision, time-domain (TD) precision, oblique beam accuracy, computational speed, and mesh-density independence. Results: Among three simulators, MMC achieves superior accuracy in SD and TD metrics, and shows robustness across all optical properties. NIRFASTer and Toast++ demonstrate comparable overall performance. In general, MMC is optimal for accuracy-critical TD-DOI applications, while NIRFASTer and Toast++ suit scenarios prioritizing speed with sufficiently large $\\mu_s'$. Besides, virtual source correction is essential for non-contact FEM modeling, which reduced average errors by > 34% in large-angle scenarios. Significance: This work provides benchmarked guidelines for simulator selection during the development phase of next-generation TD-DOI systems. Our work represents the first study to systematically validate TD simulators against SPAD array-based data under clinically relevant non-contact conditions, bridging a critical gap in biomedical optical simulation standards.

Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup.

Here, we employ a Rydberg quantum simulator to adiabatically prepare critical ground states of both a one-dimensional ring and a two-dimensional square lattice. By accounting for and tuning the openness of our quantum system, which is well-captured by the introduction of a single phenomenological length scale, we are able to directly observe power-law correlations and extract the corresponding scaling dimensions. Moreover, in two dimensions, we observe a decoupling between phase transitions in the bulk and on the boundary, allowing us to identify two distinct boundary universality classes. Our work demonstrates that direct adiabatic preparation of critical states in quantum simulators can complement recent approaches to studying quantum criticality using the Kibble-Zurek mechanism or digital quantum circuits.

We demonstrate the algorithm on the two-dimensional Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm (MBB) beam problem. By restricting design variables to binary values, we reformulate the compliance minimization task as a combinatorial satisfiability problem solved using Grover's algorithm. Within Grover's oracle, the compliance is computed through the finite-element method (FEM) using established quantum algorithms, including block-encoding of the stiffness matrix, Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) for matrix inversion, Hadamard test, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). The complete algorithm is implemented and validated using classical quantum-circuit simulations. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the method evaluates the compliance of exponentially many structures in quantum superposition in polynomial time. In the global search, our approach maintains Grover's quadratic speedup compared to classical unstructured search. Overall, the proposed quantum workflow demonstrates how quantum algorithms can advance the field of computational science and engineering.         ",
