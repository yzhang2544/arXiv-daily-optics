    "abstract": "           We propose an extended neural adjoint (ENA) framework, which meets six key criteria for artificial intelligence-assisted inverse design of optical multilayer thin films (OMTs): accuracy, efficiency, diversity, scalability, flexibility, and interpretability. To enhance the scalability of the existing neural adjoint method, we present a novel forward neural network architecture for OMTs and introduce a material loss function into the existing neural adjoint loss function, facilitating the exploration of material configurations of OMTs. Furthermore, we present the detailed formulation of the regression activation mapping for the presented forward neural network architecture (F-RAM), a feature visualization method aimed at improving interpretability. We validated the efficacy of the material loss by conducting an ablation study, where each component of the loss function is systematically removed and evaluated. The results indicated that the inclusion of the material loss significantly improves accuracy and diversity. To substantiate the performance of the ENA-based inverse design, we compared it against the residual network-based global optimization network (Res-GLOnet). The ENA yielded the OMT solutions of an inverse design with higher accuracy and better diversity compared to the Res-GLOnet. To demonstrate the interpretability, we applied F-RAM to diverse OMT structures with similar optical properties, obtained by the proposed ENA method. We showed that distributions of feature importance for various OMT structures exhibiting analogous optical properties are consistent, despite variations in material configurations, layer number, and thicknesses. Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility of the ENA method by restricting the initial layer of OMTs to SiO2 and 100 nm.         ",

    "abstract": "           Strong light-matter interactions in 2D materials have garnered significant interest for their potential in nonlinear optics and quantum photonics. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), with their robust excitonic responses, serve as promising materials for exploring these interactions. Importantly, tailoring such strong coupling giving rise to tunable quantum and non-linear emissions are under explored. In this study, we propose a novel approach that employs liquid crystals (LCs) as a tunable medium to modulate the strong coupling between TMDC excitons and photonic modes and hence gives rise to tunable quantum emissions. LCs offer high birefringence and anisotropic optical properties, which can be dynamically tuned using external stimuli such as electric fields or temperature variations. By embedding TMDCs within an LC environment and coupling them to photonic quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC), we demonstrate precise control over the exciton-photon interactions. The orientation of the LCs, governed by applied external fields, directly influences the coupling strength, enabling real-time modulation of exciton-polariton states and Rabi-splitting. Our system exhibits Rabi splitting energy of 182.5 MeV in air, and 139, 153.7, and 131 meV under different LC orientations. Additionally second order autocorrelation function calculated at zero delay yields \\( g^{(2)}(0) = 0.89 \\), demonstrating photon anti-bunching, confirming the quantum nature of emission. Our findings establish a versatile platform where TMDCs and LCs synergistically enable electrically controllable strong coupling, offering a scalable and responsive architecture for next-generation quantum photonic devices.

Metasurfaces, two-dimensional arrays of nanostructures, have been studied intensively to enhance and control pair generation via spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).

The nanoresonators support quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) with a quality factor of up to 120, enhancing light-matter interactions. This design achieves a 20-fold increase in SPDC rate compared to an unstructured film and significantly higher brightness, resulting in enhanced quantum photon-pair generation.

    "abstract": "           Silicon's inherently indirect bandgap severely limits its radiative efficiency, posing a fundamental challenge to the development of practical silicon-based light sources. While strategies such as nanoscale confinement of electrons and holes (quantum dots), Mie resonators, and hybrid plasmonic structures have improved emission, they typically require complex fabrication workflows. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually distinct and scalable approach to enable light emission from a bulk silicon wafer by decorating its surface with gold or copper nanoparticles. Remarkably, the effect is nearly identical for Au and Cu, with particle size emerging as the dominant factor. We show that strong luminescence from the bulk wafer emerges only when the nanoparticle diameter is below 2 nm. We attribute this effect to the formation of spatially confined photonic states with broadened momentum distributions, which must enable diagonal, phonon-independent optical transitions that bypass the limitations imposed by silicon's indirect bandgap. This mechanism yields broadband emission across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, with quantum efficiencies comparable to direct bandgap semiconductors, representing a 10^5-fold increase in integrated spectral intensity. This discovery challenges the conventional understanding of silicon's optical constraints and opens a practical pathway toward high-performance silicon-based optical and optoelectronic components.

While successful for model Hamiltonians, their application to molecular systems remains challenging for several reasons. In this work, we introduce three innovations to overcome some of the key limitations. (1) We propose two novel ans\u00e4tzet hat hybridize tensor network and neural network states for addressing initialization challenges and enhancing the expressivity of tensor networks. First, we develop a bounded-degree graph recurrent neural network (BDG-RNN) ansatz that leverages graph-based updates, enabling applications to molecular electronic structure problems. Second, we introduce restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) inspired correlators to further enhance expressivity and improve accuracy, without dramatically modifying the underlying variational Monte Carlo (VMC) optimization framework. (2) We introduce a semi-stochastic algorithm for local energy evaluation, which significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. Combining these advances, we demonstrate that our approaches can achieve chemical accuracy in challenging systems, including the one-dimensional hydrogen chain H50, the iron-sulfur cluster [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]^{2-}, and a three-dimensional $3 \\times 3 \\times 2$ hydrogen cluster H18.

Here, we present an approach which combines structured light irradiation with tailored sample morphology for enhanced and highcontrast optical magnetic field excitation, and we test this technique on Eu$^{3+}$ ions. We generate spectrally tunable, narrowband, polarization-shaped ultrashort laser pulses, which are specifically optimized for the spectral and the spatial selective excitation of magnetic dipole and electric dipole transitions in Eu$^{3+}$ : Y$_2$O$_3$ nanostructures integrated into a metallic antenna. In the presence of the metallic antenna, the excitation with an azimuthally polarized beam is shown to provide at least a 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of the magnetic dipole transition as compared to a radially polarized beam or a conventional Gaussian beam.

    "abstract": "           The exceptionally low-energy isomeric transition in $^{229}$Th at around 148.4 nm offers a unique opportunity for coherent nuclear control and the realisation of a nuclear clock. Recent advances, most notably the incorporation of large ensembles of $^{229}$Th nuclei in transparent crystals and the development of pulsed vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) lasers, have enabled initial laser spectroscopy of this transition. However, the lack of an intense, narrow-linewidth VUV laser has precluded coherent nuclear manipulation. Here we introduce and demonstrate the first continuous-wave laser at 148.4 nm, generated via four-wave mixing (FWM) in cadmium vapor. The source delivers 100 nW of power with a linewidth well below 100 Hz and supports broad wavelength tunability. This represents a five-orders-of-magnitude improvement in linewidth over all previous single-frequency lasers below 190 nm, marking a major advance in laser technology. We develop a spatially resolved homodyne technique to place a stringent upper bound on the phase noise induced by the FWM process and demonstrate sub-hertz linewidth capability. These results eliminate the final technical hurdle to a $^{229}$Th-based nuclear clock, opening new directions in quantum metrology, nuclear quantum optics and precision tests of the Standard Model. More broadly, they establish a widely tunable, ultranarrow-linewidth laser platform for applications across quantum information science, condensed matter physics, and high-resolution VUV spectroscopy.

In this paper, a fully quantum derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed.

Multiple estimates come from the multiple bins of the spectrum with spectroscopy, multiple times with dynamic imaging, or multiple frequencies when utilizing spectral excitation. The method presented in this manuscript, called the L2 optimal method, is compared to the commonly used RefPeak method which uses the spectral bin with the highest energy to estimate the sensitivity maps. The L2 optimal method yields more accurate sensitivity maps when imaging a numerical phantom and is shown to yield a higher signal-to-noise ratio when imaging the brain, pancreas, and heart with hyperpolarized pyruvate as the contrast agent with hyperpolarized MRI.

Continuous crystallization is a promising method for producing battery-grade lithium carbonate, but its optimization is challenged by a complex parameter space and limited data. This study introduces a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the continuous crystallization of lithium carbonate.

Boostlets are spatiotemporal functions parametrized with dilations, Lorentz boosts, and translations in space--time.

We formulate a discrete boostlet frame using Meyer wavelets and bump functions and examine its sparsity properties. An analysis with experimentally measured fields indicates that discrete boostlet coefficients decay significantly faster and attain superior reconstruction performance than wavelets, curvelets, shearlets, and wave atoms.

    "abstract": "           The inverse design of metasurfaces poses a considerable challenge because of the intricate interdependencies that exist between structural characteristics and electromagnetic responses. Traditional optimization methods require significant computational resources and frequently do not produce the most effective solutions. This study presents a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning approach known as Latent Style-based Quantum GAN (LaSt-QGAN). This method integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to enhance the optimization of metasurface designs aimed at achieving narrow-band absorption and unidirectionality. The proposed method results in a reduction of training time by 10X and a decrease in data requirements by 40X when compared to traditional GAN-based approaches. The produced metasurface designs demonstrate a high fidelity in relation to the target absorption spectra compared to the classical GAN based methods. Additionally, the integration of a material look-up table facilitates manufacturability by allowing for the substitution of predicted material properties with viable alternatives, all while preserving performance accuracy. Moreover the model is able to generate Q-factor upto the order of $10^4$, while the training dataset has Q-factor upto the order of $10^3$.         ",

    "abstract": "           It is known that line optical tweezers (LOT) can measure potential of mean force (PMF) between colloidal particles in the bulk. However, PMF obtained with LOT is empirically modified before showing the result of the final form in order to correct the potential rise at long distances. In the present letter, we derive theoretical correction methods for acquisition of PMF by using statistical mechanics. Using the new methods, PMF can be obtained without the empirical fitting equation. Through the new methods, external potential acting on the trapped two colloidal particles induced by LOT can also be obtained. As an additional study, we explain two methods for obtaining PMF between colloidal particles on a substrate surface, in which a normal single optical tweezers with a fixed focal point is used, and for obtaining PMF between colloidal particles trapped by dual-beam optical tweezers in the bulk. These methods can also obtain the external potential acting on the trapped two colloidal particles.         ",

    "title": "Self-ion implantation and structural relaxation in amorphous silicon",
    "abstract": "           Self-ion implantation amorphization is an established approach to study the structure and properties of amorphous silicon (a-Si). Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM) has consistently observed Medium-Range Order (MRO) in this system that is not consistent with the Continuous Random Network (CRN) model. Using this technique we find that the degree of MRO first increases on thermal annealing and then decreases before finally recrystallizing. We discuss this new result in the light of previous experimental studies and recent theoretical observations on the favorability of the paracrystalline (PC) model over the CRN in a-Si. At ion doses far above the minimum required to amorphize, a high defect density is found in the PC phase, which anneals out at 500oC. The PC structure after 500oC annealing is independent of the initial implantation conditions and appears to represent a metastable and highly-ordered structure. Higher-temperature annealing causes a reduction in the degree of MRO and the structure approaches but does not reach a fully continuous random network before eventually crystallizing above 600oC. The effect of high dose implantation is to increase the defect density in the as-implanted state and the annealing of these defects is likely responsible for the large characteristic heat evolution at low temperature.

    "abstract": "           Cavity polaritons, quasiparticles formed by coherent light-matter coupling, are at the heart of fundamental concepts of quantum optics. The quintessential signature of this coherent coupling is the Rabi oscillation, which results from the neglect of the counter-rotating-wave (CRW) effect in the weak-coupling regime. The goal of this letter is to predict resonant beatings that envelop the Rabi oscillation on the second or higher excitation manifold. These polariton beatings arise from the CRW term in the Dicke or Pauli-Fierz model and are directly correlated with the asymmetry in polariton eigenenergies. Our findings highlight the relevance of the CRW effect even in the weak-coupling regime, offer novel perspectives about coherent polariton dynamics, and shed new light on experiments of coupled quantum systems.
