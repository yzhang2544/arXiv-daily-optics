    "abstract": "           Nonlinear optical (NLO) imaging platforms traditionally rely on refractive microscope objectives, which suffer from chromatic aberrations and temporal dispersion of pulsed excitation light. These issues degrade spatial imaging properties and signal brightness. Furthermore, the limited transmission range of refractive materials restricts NLO imaging, especially for applications requiring short- to mid-wave infrared excitation. While reflective microscope objectives offer an achromatic solution and broader transmission range (from visible to mid-infrared), conventional Schwarzschild designs have a central obscuration, which limits transmission throughput, imparts diffraction effects into the images, and, more generally, hinders the adoption of reflective optics in NLO microscopy. We overcome these obscuration-based limitations by developing a novel, reflective microscope objective using freeform mirrors in a non-coaxial geometry. This innovative, obscuration-free design boasts a 0.65 numerical aperture (NA), near diffraction-limited imaging performance, and offers significantly improved transmission with wider fields-of-view. We demonstrate its utility by integrating it into a standard laser-scanning microscope and performing NLO microscopy across a wide range of excitation wavelengths. Our freeform microscope objective outperforms standard reflective designs, providing an achromatic, dispersion-free alternative to refractive lenses for NLO imaging.         ",

    "abstract": "           Biomolecules that constitute life on Earth are chiral, but the precise mechanism by which homochirality emerged remains a mystery. In this work it is demonstrated that reactions of radical pairs, where one of the radical electron spins is polarised, can be enantioselective. This phenomenon arises from transient coherent quantum dynamics of the radical pair electron spins, which is known to occur even in warm and noisy condensed phase environments, where energetic perturbations much smaller than thermal energy can have large effects on reactivity. A quantitative theory is presented based on the molecular theory of chirality induced spin selectivity (CISS), where electron exchange interactions and chirality-dependent spin-orbit coupling effects control enantioselectivity. This theory provides useful bounds on the maximum enantiomeric excess for these reactions, which are found to be consistent with previous experiments. The enantioseletive radical pair mechanism presented here provides an alternative mechanistic basis to a recent proposal that spin-polarised photoelectrons from magnetite provided the initial chiral symmetry breaking necessary for the inception of homochirality in Nature, as well as suggests a new strategy for asymmetric synthesis using spin-polarised electrons.

    "abstract": "           Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) provides a powerful platform for investigating low-energy excitations in quantum materials. Because these materials are often limited in size, experimental setups typically rely on tightly focused beams and metallic holders with small apertures. In this work, we perform a systematic study of how aperture geometry influences THz signal transmission in a standard free-space configuration. By analyzing time- and frequency-domain data for circular apertures of varying diameters and thicknesses, we quantify the spatial and spectral filtering effects imposed by aperture size. We show that small apertures progressively attenuate low-frequency components of the transmitted signal, while higher-frequency content remains comparatively unaffected. These effects become especially significant for apertures smaller than typical THz beam waists, resulting in amplitude suppression and phase distortions that compromise the accuracy of frequency-domain analysis and optical parameter retrieval. The transmitted intensity as a function of aperture diameter also provides a straightforward method for estimating the beam waist at the focus. In contrast, standard aperture thicknesses do not introduce measurable distortions, confirming the adequacy of treating thick, non-resonant apertures as dielectric slabs. These findings establish practical guidelines for aperture selection in THz-TDS and underscore the importance of preserving low-frequency response for reliable characterization of quantum materials.

In this study, we investigate the potential benefits and limitations of PQCs on two chemically meaningful datasets: (1) the BSE49 dataset, containing bond separation energies for 49 different classes of chemical bonds, and (2) a dataset of water conformations, where coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wavefunctions are predicted from lower-level electronic structure methods using the data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) approach.

A simple example is the far-field speckle pattern in 1D light scattering: classical light forms 1D speckles defined by the numerical aperture, whereas biphoton scattering depends in addition on the photon correlation length, forming 2D elliptical speckles. To date, the behavior of quantum speckles for shorter propagation distances has not been considered. We remedy this here by considering the paraxial evolution of two-photon entanglement at arbitrary propagation distances from an isotropic scatterer. We show, theoretically, numerically, and experimentally, that the two length scales of the biphoton introduce a new Fresnel regime between the conventional near and far fields. Further, we show that the quantum near field is characterized by speckles with a square shape that remain constant during propagation. In contrast, the intermediate regime can be engineered to have a constant speckle size along the sum coordinate but a linearly expanding speckle size along the difference coordinate, with a speckle shape that transitions from square to elliptical. The results merge quantum coherence with scattering statistics and suggest new regimes of operation for correlation-based quantum sensing and imaging.         ",

    "abstract": "           This paper presents numerical investigations of flow-acoustic resonances in deep and inclined cavities using wall-resolved large-eddy simulations. A cavity with $D/L = 2.632$ is subjected to ($M_\\infty=0.2$ and $0.3$) at three inclination angles ($\\alpha=30^{\\circ}$, $60^{\\circ}$, and $90^{\\circ}$). Fully turbulent boundary layers from precursor simulations are employed upstream of the cavities. The simulation results show significant differences between inclined and orthogonal cavity flows, particularly at $M_{\\infty} = 0.3$, where the inclined cavities exhibit stronger resonances (by more than 20 dB) at a lower peak frequency ($St=0.276$) than the orthogonal cavity, whose peak occurs at $St=0.849$. Acoustic modal analysis identifies these frequencies as the 1st and 2nd eigenmodes. Further analysis shows that the mode selection is linked to the hydrodynamic modes that pair with the acoustic modes. In the orthogonal cavity, the 2nd hydrodynamic mode prevails, in which two small vortices travel across the cavity opening. In the inclined cavities, however, a single large-scale roll-up vortex is generated owing to the strong Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the shear layer. Importantly, this vortex spends much of its lifetime growing in size rather than traveling rapidly downstream, resulting in a longer crossing time per cycle that correlates with the 1st acoustic eigenmode frequency. Furthermore, aeroacoustic resolvent analysis indicates that inclined cavities amplify acoustic responses effectively and exhibit weaker source-sink cancellation than the orthogonal cavity. These mechanisms are the primary contributors to the enhanced aeroacoustic response of the inclined cavities. Finally, it is proposed that the ratio of acoustic particle displacement to momentum thickness can be used for predicting the onset of deep cavity resonance associated with the identified distinctive vortex dynamics.

    "abstract": "           Fano resonance, arising from the interference between a discrete resonance and a continuum of states, results in sharp and asymmetric line shapes and has significant applications in advanced photonic devices, particularly in sensing, filtering, and nonlinear optics. Nowadays, metasurfaces comprised of engineering microstructures play a crucial role in generation and manipulation of Fano resonance in photonics. However, current metasurfaces dominantly rely on local symmetry breaking of the microstructures to induce Fano resonances, which significant limits their tunability and scalable fabrication for practical applications. To address the challenge, a metal-dielectric hybrid metasurface is demonstrated to achieve nonlocal generation of Fano resonance with no symmetry breaking in the terahertz (THz) band. The Fano resonance, including its existence and peak frequency, is sensitively controlled by the thickness and dielectric constant of the dielectric layer, which is experimentally observed. Our analysis elucidates that the metallic layer with a pair of dumbbell holes leads to the band folding and coupling of guided modes within the dielectric layer. When the thickness or dielectric constant surpasses a critical value, the guided mode resonance falls below the diffraction limit, resulting in a unique nonlocal Fano resonance due to the interaction between the resonance and background transmission facilitated by dumbbell holes. Furthermore, the Fano transmission peak corresponds to an anapole excitation, revealed by multipole calculations. Benefiting from the ability to control the Fano resonance with no symmetry breaking, the proposed hybrid THz metasurface will advance broad applications in the fields of sensors, optical switches, and tunable filters.

In this work, we investigate the capabilities and limitations of a square-lattice ($C_4$-symmetric) photonic crystal composed of a single dielectric material that supports interface-localized modes at the boundary between regions characterized by distinct obstructed atomic limits (OALs). These modes are confined to a common band gap and exhibit high transmission, even in the presence of structural perturbations. Our analysis reveals that the interface modes are stabilized by a mismatch in the position of Wannier centers between the two adjoining crystals. We demonstrate nearly lossless transmission around sharp turns and through localized defects, though the robustness depends asymmetrically on the side of perturbation, reflecting the partial nature of the protection. We also show that increasing the number of photonic crystal periods surrounding the interface enhances both modal confinement and spectral stability. These findings establish polarization mismatch between OALs as a practical and fabrication-compatible mechanism for engineering robust photonic transport in \\(C_4\\)-symmetric systems.         ",

We evaluate the quantum Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (QCRB) for different quantum states, including single-mode coherent states, multi-frequency coherent states, and phase-averaged coherent states. Our results show that the proposed setup can achieve the QCRB of sensitivity and outperform iSCAT for all considered quantum states for mass and phase estimation of a particle.         ",

    "title": "Fluctuation-dominated phase ordering in the one dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model",
    "abstract": "           Many physical systems, including some examples of active matter, granular assemblies, and biological systems, show fluctuation-dominated phase ordering (FDPO), where macroscopic fluctuations coexist with long-range order. Most of these systems are out of equilibrium. By contrast, a recent work has analytically demonstrated that an equilibrium one-dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model shows FDPO. The analytical results rely on a cluster representation of the model that we term TIDSI-CL and are governed by the ratio, $c$, of the long-range interaction strength to the critical temperature. We show that the allowed range of $c$ is very narrow in the TIDSI model while it is unbounded in TIDSI-CL. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations for the TIDSI model and show consistency with the analytical results in the allowed range of $c$. The correlation length grows strongly on approaching the critical point, leading to a broad near-critical region. Within this region, $\\alpha$, which is the cusp exponent of the power-law decay of the scaled correlation function at criticality, changes to $\\alpha^\\text{eff}$. We also investigate the coarsening dynamics of the model: the correlation function, domain size distribution, and aging behavior are consistent with the equilibrium properties upon replacing the system size, $L$, with the coarsening length, $\\mathcal{L}(t)$. The mean largest cluster size shows logarithmic corrections due to finite $L$ and waiting time, $t_w$. The aging autocorrelation function exhibits two different scaling forms, characterized by exponents $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$, at short and long times compared to $t_w$, where $\\beta=\\alpha/2$.

    "title": "Entanglement dynamics of Multi-Level Atoms embedded in Photonic Crystals: Leveraging Resonant Dipole Interactions and Quantum Interference",
    "abstract": "           We present a comprehensive investigation of entanglement dynamics in multi-level V-type atomic systems embedded within PC cavities. We mainly focus on the synergistic roles of resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference through analytical modeling and numerical simulations using the Schrodinger equation. Key findings reveal that resonant interaction dominates when interatomic distances align with the localization length of photon-atom bound states lying in the bandgap region. The entanglement is preserved for extended times due to stronger RDDI, when dipoles of each atom are aligned parallel or anti-parallel for both quantum-correlated and separable initial states. For orthogonally oriented atomic dipoles, initially entangled states display a distinctive oscillatory entanglement behavior characterized by non-Markovian effects such as delayed feedback and entanglement revival. In contrast, initially separable states experience a more rapid decay of entanglement under these conditions. It is mainly driven by destructive interference between vacuum-mediated pathways and bandgap-engineered photonic density of states. We further demonstrate that positioning the atomic excited states deeper within the photonic bandgap accelerates the decay of entanglement oscillations due to the exponential suppression of resonant energy exchange mediated by evanescent modes. Our analysis establishes RDDI and quantum interference as potential tools for controlling entanglement lifetimes in photonic crystal environments, offering new strategies for engineered quantum coherence.

    "abstract": "           Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through the information content of their measurements alone, enabling application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed to automate this process through gradient-based optimization. In this work, we study IDEAL across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage, long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for real-world imaging system design.
