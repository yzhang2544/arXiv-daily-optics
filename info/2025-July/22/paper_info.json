In this spacetime, which encompasses both a black hole and a white hole, we place a massless scalar field that propagates at the speed of light, which is modified by the curvature. We simulate this system using an SQUID array, in which we can alter the propagation of light using an external magnetic field. We consider both infalling and outfalling radiation, giving rise to two different scenarios: downstream and upstream radiation. We compute the magnetic flux profile required by the simulation in both cases and find out that the former is more experimentally suitable.         ",

    "abstract": "           The realization of ultra stable optical frequency transmission through fiber networks is critical for advancing global optical frequency standards and enabling applications such as redefining the second in the International System of Units, geophysical sensing, quantum network construction, and fundamental physics experiments. However, achieving high reliability and low instability optical frequency carrier transmission links over distances exceeding thousands of kilometers remains technically challenging, thereby limiting the scalability and reliability of such networks. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that the noise accumulation in long distance optical links can be mitigated by narrowband purification of the optical signal's phase noise, enabling optical links of theoretically unlimited length. Additionally, we implemented digital optical phase measurement and feedback technology to calibrate noise compensation deviations caused by inconsistencies in round trip optical frequencies, enhancing link stability. By adopting digital phase measurement instead of traditional phase detectors, we expanded the dynamic noise tolerance range of the optical phase-locked loop, significantly improving system reliability. Ultimately, on a 2067 km telecommunications fiber link with a noise level exceeding 5000 rad^2/Hz.km, we achieved an optical frequency transfer with a daily instability of 2.9 E-21 without experiencing any optical cycle slips maintaining continuous operation for four days. This work establishes a technical foundation for leveraging existing fiber resources to construct global scale optical frequency standard networks.         ",

    "abstract": "           Microscopes face a trade-off between spatial resolution, field-of-view, and frame rate -- improving one of these properties typically requires sacrificing the others, due to the limited spatiotemporal throughput of the sensor. To overcome this, we propose a new microscope that achieves snapshot gigapixel-scale imaging with a sensor array and a diffractive optical element (DOE). We improve the spatiotemporal throughput in two ways. First, we capture data with an array of 48 sensors resulting in 48x more pixels than a single sensor. Second, we use point spread function (PSF) engineering and compressive sensing algorithms to fill in the missing information from the gaps surrounding the individual sensors in the array, further increasing the spatiotemporal throughput of the system by an additional >5.4x. The array of sensors is modeled as a single large-format \"super-sensor,\" with erasures corresponding to the gaps between the individual sensors. The array is placed at the output of a (nearly) 4f imaging system, and we design a DOE for the Fourier plane that generates a distributed PSF that encodes information from the entire super-sensor area, including the gaps. We then computationally recover the large-scale image, assuming the object is sparse in some domain. Our calibration-free microscope can achieve ~3 {\\mu}m resolution over >5.2 cm^2 FOVs at up to 120 fps, culminating in a total spatiotemporal throughput of 25.2 billion pixels per second. We demonstrate the versatility of our microscope in two different modes: structural imaging via darkfield contrast and functional fluorescence imaging of calcium dynamics across dozens of freely moving C. elegans simultaneously.

    "abstract": "           We present a new method that efficiently solves TO problems and provides a practical pathway to leverage quantum computing to exploit potential quantum advantages. This work targets on large-scale, multi-material TO challenges for three-dimensional (3D) continuum structures, beyond what have been addressed in prior studies. Central to this new method is the modified Dantzig-Wolfe (MDW) decomposition, which effectively mitigates the escalating computational cost associated with using classical Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers to solve the master problems involved in TO, by decomposing the MILP into local and global sub-problems. Evaluated on 3D bridge designs, our classical implementation achieves comparable solution quality to state-of-the-art TO methods while reducing computation time by orders of magnitude. It also maintains low runtimes even in extreme cases where classical MILP solvers fail to converge, such as designs involving over 50 million variables. The computationally intensive local sub-problems, which are essentially Binary Integer Programming (BIP) problems, can potentially be accelerated by quantum computing via their equivalent Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. Enabled by the MDW decomposition, the resulting QUBO formulation requires only sparse qubit connectivity and incurs a QUBO construction cost that scales linearly with problem size, potentially accelerating BIP sub-problem solutions by an additional order of magnitude. All observed and estimated speedups become increasingly significant with larger problem sizes and when moving from single-material to multi-material designs. This suggests that this new method, along with quantum computing, will play an increasingly valuable role in addressing the scale and complexity of real-world TO applications.         ",

We present a novel framework that combines a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) with a tandem network, enabling robust and efficient on-demand inverse design of photonic structures. Unlike prior approaches that use CVAEs or tandem networks in isolation, our method integrates spectral adjustment and structural prediction in a unified architecture. Specifically, the CVAE adjusts the idealized target spectra, such as Lorentzian-shaped notches, making them more physically realizable and consistent with the training data distribution. This adjusted spectrum is then passed to the tandem network, which predicts the corresponding structural parameters. The framework effectively handles both narrowband (<50 nm) and highly complex spectra, while addressing the one-to-many mapping challenge inherent in inverse design. The model achieves high accuracy, and the designed spectra closely match full-wave simulation results, validating its practicality for advanced nanophotonic applications.         ",

Recently, silicates have emerged as a promising new class of 2D materials, but their nonlinear optical properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate layer-dependent nonlinear absorption and optical limiting capabilities of 2D muscovite using femtosecond laser excitation at 450 nm. The two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient is highly sensitive to both the number of layers and excitation intensity, increasing markedly from (3.91+/-0.06)x10^3 cm GW^-1 in multilayer structures to (6.94+/-0.17)x10^5 cm GW^-1 in the monolayer limit at a peak intensity of 68 GW cm^-2, highlighting a strong layer-dependent enhancement in nonlinear absorption. Additionally, monolayer muscovite exhibits an optical limiting threshold of 1.46 mJ cm^-2, outperforming graphene and other 2D dichalcogenides. This enhanced TPA arises from quantum confinement and intrinsic lattice defects that facilitate nonlinear optical transitions. Density functional theory reveals that liquid-phase exfoliation disrupts potassium interlayers and induces oxygen vacancies, generating mid-gap electronic states that significantly enhance TPA. These insights open new avenues for designing low-fluence, high-efficiency optical limiters using 2D silicates.         ",

Therefore, this paper proposes an ultrasonic mode-conversion transducer consisting of a Langevin transducer and an ABH wedge radiant plate to investigate the potential applications of ABH in ultrasonic levitation and multifunctional particle manipulation. The theoretical model of flexural vibration of the radiant plate is established by utilizing Timoshenko beam theory and transfer matrix method, and the calculated vibration frequencies demonstrated good agreement with those obtained from finite element simulations (FES). The electrical impedance frequency response characteristics, vibration modes and the near-field sound pressure distribution of the transducer in air were also simulated. The results revealed that the amplitude of the ABH wedge radiant plate increases stepwise, and the sound pressure exhibits a gradient distribution. A prototype of the transducer was fabricated and experimentally tested, confirming the accuracy of FES and the feasibility of the design approach.

A two-order-of-magnitude enhancement in Raman intensity is observed when the pump energy is tuned near the exciton resonance. Under Stokes-resonant conditions, additional Raman lines accompanied by excitonic photoluminescence are observed, suggesting the participation of non-Bloch intermediate states in the scattering process.

However, the observation of these unique properties at optical frequencies remains elusive, as the necessary modulation amplitudes of the permittivity to show notable momentum bandgaps are relatively high, inaccessible with available materials. While it has been known that structuring photonic time crystals at the sub-wavelength scale can enhance the momentum bandgap, we push this concept to the extreme by leveraging the nanophotonic toolbox. Specifically, we demonstrate that nanophotonic structures composed of scatterers supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum can significantly reduce the required amplitude of temporal permittivity modulation by enhancing the interaction time between light and time-varying matter. This allows us to observe extremely wide momentum bandgaps despite the material properties having tiny modulation amplitudes. Our approach bridges the concepts of bound states in the continuum and time-varying metamaterials, paving the way toward realizable photonic time crystals at optical frequencies.         ",

    "abstract": "           River water quality monitoring is important for aquatic life, livestock, and humans because clean water is critical to meeting food demand during the global food crisis. Excessive contaminants, including phosphate, deplete dissolved oxygen and trigger eutrophication, leading to serious health and ecological problems. Continuous sensors that track phosphate levels can therefore help prevent eutrophication. In this work we present a lithography-free phosphate sensor (P-sensor) that detects phosphate in river water at parts-per-billion levels. The device uses a solid-state indicator electrode formed by 3D-printed periodic polymer patterns (8 um feature size) coated with a thin phosphate ion-selective membrane. The P-sensor detects as little as 1 ppb phosphate across 0 - 475 ppm with a response time under 30 seconds. We validated the sensor on Rappahannock River water, Virginia (less than 0.8 ppm phosphate) at sites upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant and benchmarked the results against a commercial phosphate meter. A feed-forward neural network was trained to predict phosphate levels, achieving a mean-squared error below 1e-3, zero standard deviation, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.997 for river samples. These results demonstrate a practical tool for continuous water-quality monitoring that can inform stakeholders and policymakers and ultimately improve public health.         ",

In particular, we develop a rigorous approximation framework that enables precise frequency estimation from a finite number of signal samples. Our analysis builds on new results involving prolate spheroidal wave functions and yields error bounds that reveal a sharp accuracy transition governed by the observation time and spectral density of the signal. These results are very general and thus carry far. As one important example application we consider the quantum computation for molecular systems. By combining our spectral method with a quantum subroutine for signal generation, we define quantum prolate diagonalization (QPD) - a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm. QPD simultaneously estimates ground and excited state energies within chemical accuracy at the Heisenberg limit. An analysis of different input states demonstrates the robustness of the method, showing that high precision can be retained even under imperfect state preparation.         ",

Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed exactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this structure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as killer operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations. We showcase this framework using examples based on homogeneous catalysts of industrial relevance and validate tunable difficulty through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) convergence behavior.

This process, while resembling quantum cloning, adheres to the no-cloning theorem due to its state-dependent and non-universal nature.

    "abstract": "           Biological systems rely on ions and molecules as information carriers rather than electrons, motivating the development of devices that interface with biochemical systems for sensing, information processing, and actuation via spatiotemporal control of ions and molecules. Iontronics aims to achieve this vision by constructing devices composed of ion-conducting materials such as polyelectrolyte hydrogels, but advancing beyond simple single-stage circuit configurations that operate under steady-state conditions is a challenge. Here, we propose and model more complex ionic circuits, namely bistable flip-flop and ring oscillators, consisting of multiple ionic bipolar junction transistors (IBJTs). We begin by modeling and characterizing single IBJTs using both a simplified one-dimensional Nernst-Planck model and a more-detailed two-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck model, elucidating the effects of geometry, size, and fixed charge on the IBJT performance and response time. The one- and two-dimensional models exhibit good agreement, indicating negligible transverse inhomogeneities. Additionally, these models show that reducing the base width improves current amplification, a behavior analogous to electronic BJTs. Building on this understanding, by using the IBJTs as voltage inverters and buffers, we design and model more complex ionic circuits that dynamically change their states in response to ionic signals. Specifically, we demonstrate that the ionic flip-flop retains one-bit memory and that the ring oscillator achieves autonomous periodic self-oscillation without an external clock. Our work provides a foundation for designing dynamic iontronic circuitry using ionic conductors, enabling biochemical signal processing and logic operations based on ionic transport.         ",

    "abstract": "           Tight-binding models can accurately replicate the band structure and topology of crystalline systems. They have been widely used in solid-state physics due to their versatility and low computational cost. It is straightforward to build an accurate tight-binding model of any crystalline system using the crystal's maximally localized Wannier functions as a basis. Unfortunately, in 3D photonic crystals, the transversality condition of Maxwell's equations precludes the construction of a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions via usual techniques. As a result, building reliable tight-binding models of 3D photonic crystals has not been straightforward up to now. In this work, we show how to overcome this problem using topological quantum chemistry, allowing us to express the band structure of the photonic crystal as a difference of band representations. This can be achieved by introducing a set of auxiliary modes, as recently proposed in Christensen et al., Phys. Rev. X 12, 021066 (2022), which regularizes the Gamma-point obstruction arising from the transversality constraint of Maxwell's equations. The decomposition into elementary band representations allows us to isolate a set of pseudo-orbitals that permit us to construct an accurate transversality-enforced tight-binding model that matches the dispersion, symmetry content, and topology of the 3D photonic crystal under study. Moreover, we show how to introduce the effects of a gyrotropic bias in the framework, modeled via non-minimal coupling to a static magnetic field. Our work provides the first systematic method to analytically model the photonic bands of the lowest transverse modes over the entire Brillouin zone via a transversality-enforced tight-binding model.

    "abstract": "           We argue that measurement data in quantum physics can be rigorously interpreted only as a result of a statistical, macroscopic process, taking into account the indistinguishable character of identical particles. Quantum determinism is in principle possible on the condition that a fully-fledged quantum-field-theoretic model is used to describe the measurement device in interaction with the studied object as one system. In contrast, any approach that relies on Born's rule discriminates the dynamics of a quantum system from that of the detector with which it interacts during measurement. In this work, we critically analyze the validity of this measurement postulate applied to single-event signals. In fact, the concept of ``individual'' particle becomes inadequate once both indistinguishability and a scattering approach allowing an unlimited interaction time for an effective detection, are considered as they should be, hence preventing the separability of two successive measurement events. In this context, measurement data should therefore be understood only as a result of statistics over many events. Accounting for the intrinsic noise of the sources and the detectors, we also show with the illustrative cases of the Schr\u00f6dinger cat and the Bell experiment that once the Born rule is abandoned on the level of a single particle, realism, locality and causality are restored. We conclude that indiscernibility and long-time detection process make quantum physics not fundamentally probabilistic.         ",
