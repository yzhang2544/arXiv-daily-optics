    "abstract": "           We present a microfluidic device that enables trapping, analysis, and on-demand release of individual microparticles through membrane deformation driven by pneumatic actuation. Inspired by Pachinko-style architectures, the system features an array of traps supported by a deformable PDMS membrane, actuated via pressure control in a pneumatic chamber bonded above. Unlike conventional rigid designs, our configuration enhances membrane flexibility using a wide elliptical cavity and suspended rectilinear flow guides. Device characterization was performed using confocal microscopy to measure membrane deformation under controlled negative pressure. The displacement profiles obtained were compared to several theoretical models, showing strong agreement with a thick-membrane approximation. Vertical membrane displacement exceeded 120 $\\mu$m under -100 mbar, allowing release of 80 $\\mu$m particles. We demonstrated rapid and repeatable particle trapping and release by applying coordinated fluidic and pneumatic pressures. The system was further integrated with a Python-based control interface using $\\mu$Manager libraries, enabling automated sequences of particle trapping, imaging, and release. The protocol includes automated priming to eliminate air bubbles in the microchannels. This work introduces a robust and fully automated microfluidic platform capable of reversible microparticle immobilization. It is well suited for applications such as high-throughput screening, mechanobiology, or real-time imaging workflows that require precise control over individual object handling.         ",

Here we show through start-to-end simulations how to realise compact, robust and tunable X-ray lasers in the water window, based on ultra-bright electron beams from plasma wakefield accelerators. First, an ultra-low-emittance electron beam is released by a plasma photocathode in a metre-scale plasma wakefield accelerator. By tuning the beam charge, space-charge forces create a balance between beam fields and wakefields that reduces beam energy spread and improves energy stability - both critical for beam extraction, transport, and focusing into a metre-scale undulator. Here, the resulting ultra-bright beams produce wavelength-tunable, coherent, femtosecond scale photon pulses at ultra-high gain. This regime enables reliable generation of millijoule-gigawatt-class X-ray laser pulses across the water window, offering tunability via the witness beam charge and robustness against variations in plasma wakefield strength. Our findings help democratise access to coherent, high-power, soft X-ray radiation.         ",

    "abstract": "           Emerging computational measurement techniques for acquiring multi-dimensional optical field information, such as spectrum and polarization, are rapidly advancing and offer promising solutions for realizing high-performance miniature systems. The performance of these computational measurement approaches is critically influenced by the choice of random media, yet a general framework for evaluating different implementations remains absent. Here, we propose a universal analytical model for computational measurement systems and reveal that the system resolution is fundamentally determined by the maximum optical path difference (OPD) permitted within the random medium. Building on this theoretical foundation, we present a resonant leaky-mode (RLM) spectropolarimeter that achieves a record high resolution-footprint-product metric. The RLM spectropolarimeter leverages the complex coupling between leaky modes in a tapered coreless optical fiber and whispering-gallery modes (WGM) of microsphere to significantly enhance the maximum OPD within a compact footprint. We simultaneously achieve an ultrahigh spectral resolution of 0.02 pm, a spectral measurement bandwidth of 150 nm, and full-Stokes polarization measurement with an accuracy of $4.732 \\times 10^{-6}$, all within a sub-square-millimeter footprint. The proposed theoretical model clarifies the key factors governing the performance of computational measurement systems based on random media and may inspires novel design of advanced computational measurement systems for optical field. The demonstrated RLM spectropolarimeter offers a potential approach for highly integrated, high-performance multi-dimensional optical field measurement.         ",

Yet this predictability often limits their expressivity, constraining complex interactions essential for advanced functionalities in computing, sensing, and security. Here we demonstrate how low symmetry integrated photonic circuits can unlock enhanced mode diversity and rich spectral complexity, enabling highly non-linear transformations of input signals into outputs. Our devices, physically unclonable moir\u00e9 quasicrystal interferometers integrated on a silicon photonics platform, exhibit aperiodic and reconfigurable spectral responses and are characterized by analyticity breaking and erasable mutual information. Using dynamic thermo-optic control to drive their complex spectral dynamics, we demonstrate that these devices function as reconfigurable physical unclonable functions (rPUFs). We also highlight their ability to perform high-dimensional input--output transformations, emulating reservoir-inspired information processing in a compact photonic platform. This work bridges the gap between engineered and natural complexity in photonic systems, revealing new opportunities for scalable, energy-efficient, and information-dense opto-electronics with applications in secure communications, hardware security, advanced sensing, and optical information processing.

Such equilibria are typically modeled by the ideal magnetohydrostatic (MHS) equation. The nonlinear, overdetermined nature of the quasisymmetric MHS equations severely complicates our understanding of the interplay between 3D shaping, equilibrium properties such as pressure and rotational transform, and B. Progress has been made through expansions near the magnetic axis; however, a more comprehensive theory is desirable. Using a combination of analysis and regression on a large dataset of numerically optimized quasisymmetric stellarators, we demonstrate that there is a hidden lower dimensionality of B on a magnetic flux surface with connections to the theory of periodic solitons. We show that $B$ on a flux surface is determined by three or at most four flux functions, each of which is a critical value of the derivative of B along the field line. While being consistent with the near-axis models, our results are global and hold even on the last closed flux surface.         ",

The orthogonal expansion (OE) technique is then applied to compute Fourier coefficients using 'natural' orthogonality. An analytical solution for composites with constant heat sources is developed by combining the SOV method and OE technique. Additionally, a Green's function (GF) based approach is formulated to handle transient heat sources and other non-homogeneous conditions, including temperature-dependent thermal conductivity. The results demonstrate that the proposed method offers significantly faster computations compared to finite element (FE) methods, while maintaining high accuracy.

    "abstract": "           Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in future optical quantum technologies. For most applications, scalable on-demand fabrication is a key requirement. Recent advances using localized electron irradiation have demonstrated near-identical emitters in the blue and yellow spectral regions. While the blue emitters have been demonstrated in cryogenic temperatures, the yellow emitters remain uncharacterized under such conditions. In this work, we therefore extended the study of yellow emitters to cryogenic temperatures. Initially, multiple spectral features were observed, prompting a systematic investigation that led to the identification of a defect emission centered around 547.5 nm with high brightness and excellent photostability. By tuning the excitation wavelength, we are able to distinguish Raman scattering peaks from the emitter emission. Further analysis of the vibronic emissions allowed us to identify an optical phonon mode, whose contribution becomes increasingly dominant at elevated temperatures. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy (PLE) reveals excitation through this phonon mode enhances the emission by almost 5-fold in cryogenic temperature. Temperature-dependent studies further elucidate the role of phonons in the emission process. These observations deepen our understanding of the nature of the emitters, opening new avenues for precise tuning of quantum light sources.         ",

Going beyond isolated EPs, here we report on the existence of exceptional rings (ERs) in planar optical resonators with specific form of circular dichroism and TE-TM splitting. Such exceptional rings possess intriguing topologies as discussed earlier for condensed matter systems, but they remain virtually unexplored in presence of nonlinearity, for which our photonic platform is ideal. We find that when Kerr-type nonlinearity (or saturable gain) is introduced, the linear ER splits into two concentric ERs, with the larger-radius ring being a ring of third-order EPs. Transitioning from linear to nonlinear regime, we present a rigorous analysis of spectral topology and report enhanced and adjustable perturbation response in the nonlinear regime. Whereas certain features are specific to our system, the results on non-Hermitian spectral topology and nonlinearity-enhanced perturbation response are generic and equally relevant to a broad class of other nonlinear non-Hermitian systems, providing a universal framework for engineering ERs and EPs in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems.

Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These \"Fibonacci waveguides\" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.

Transcatheter native outflow tract pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) has become common, but assessment of patient candidacy and selection of the optimal device remains challenging. We demonstrate an integrated open-source workflow for simulation of TPVR in image-derived models to inform device selection. Methods - Machine learning-based segmentation of CT scans was implemented to define the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). A custom workflow for device positioning and pre-compression was implemented in SlicerHeart. Resulting geometries were exported to FEBio for simulation. Visualization of results and quantification were performed using custom metrics implemented in SlicerHeart and FEBio. Results - RVOT model creation and device placement could be completed in under 1 minute. Virtual device placement using FE simulations visually mimicked actual device placement and allowed quantification of vessel strain, stress, and contact area. Regions of higher strain and stress were observed at the proximal and distal end locations of the TPVs where the devices impinge the RVOT wall. No other consistent trends were observed across simulations. The observed variability in mechanical metrics across RVOTS, stents, and locations in the RVOT highlights that no single device performs optimally in all anatomies, thereby reinforcing the need for simulation-based patient-specific assessment. Conclusions - This study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel open-source workflow for the rapid simulation of TPVR which with further refinement may inform assessment of patient candidacy and optimal device selection.

    "abstract": "           Controlling the functional properties of quantum materials with light has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, leading to the discovery of various light-induced phases of matter, such as superconductivity, ferroelectricity, magnetism and charge density waves. However, in most cases, the photoinduced phases return to equilibrium on ultrafast timescales after the light is turned off, limiting their practical applications. Here we use intense terahertz pulses to induce a metastable magnetization with a remarkably long lifetime of more than 2.5 milliseconds in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. The metastable state becomes increasingly robust as the temperature approaches the antiferromagnetic transition point, suggesting that critical order parameter fluctuations play an important part in facilitating the extended lifetime. By combining first-principles calculations with classical Monte Carlo and spin dynamics simulations, we find that the displacement of a specific phonon mode modulates the exchange couplings in a manner that favours a ground state with finite magnetization near the N\u00e9el temperature. This analysis also clarifies how the critical fluctuations of the dominant antiferromagnetic order can amplify both the magnitude and the lifetime of the new magnetic state. Our discovery demonstrates the efficient manipulation of the magnetic ground state in layered magnets through non-thermal pathways using terahertz light and establishes regions near critical points with enhanced order parameter fluctuations as promising areas to search for metastable hidden quantum states.

    "abstract": "           Here we investigate the quantum frequency conversion of entangled photons driven by a classically non-separable laser beam. We show that the frequency conversion dynamics is described by a quantum channel that stems from the classical drive field through the channel-state duality - the quantum channel is dual to the classical coherence matrix of the drive field. This implies that the evolution of entanglement in the conversion process is bound by the classical non-separability of the drive field, a result that we confirm experimentally. Furthermore, we show that the conversion dynamics can be understood as a swapping operation between classical non-separability and entanglement, unveiling a physical connection between two fundamentally different concepts.

    "abstract": "           The occurrence of several crystal phases within nanostructures of a single material presents both challenges and opportunities. While unintended phase mixing can degrade optoelectronic performances, deliberate control of polytypism enables novel heterostructures with unique quantum properties, crystal phase quantum dots (CPQDs). However, since tailoring the formation of CPQDs is difficult, applications remain scarce. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-driven crystal phase switching in GaAs nanowires during vapor-liquid-solid growth, enabling precise control of crystal phases and creations of CPQDs with monolayer precision. Nanowires are epitaxially grown on custom-made silicon micro-substrates using chemical vapor deposition within an in-situ TEM. Real-time imaging reveals that the electric field switches instantaneously the crystal phase between zinc blende and wurtzite, creating atomically sharp interfaces. Numerical simulations are developed to investigate the impact of the electric field on the catalyst droplet geometry, which largely governs the crystal phase. This constitutes a key progress towards unlocking the potential of CPQDs.         ",

    "abstract": "           Achieving optimal force sensitivity with nanomechanical resonators requires the ability to resolve their thermal vibrations. In two-dimensional resonators, this can be done by measuring the energy they absorb while vibrating in an optical standing wave formed between a light source and a mirror. However, the responsivity of this method -- the change in optical energy per unit displacement of the resonator -- is modest, fundamentally limited by the physics of propagating plane waves. We present simulations showing that replacing the mirror with a photonic crystal supporting guided resonances increases the responsivity of graphene resonators by an order of magnitude. The steep optical energy gradients enable efficient transduction of flexural vibrations using low optical power, thereby reducing heating. Furthermore, the presence of two guided resonances at different wavelengths allows thermal vibrations to be resolved with a high signal-to-noise ratio across a wide range of membrane positions in free space. Our approach provides a simple optical method for implementing ultrasensitive force detection using a graphene nanomechanical resonator.         ",

Motivated by the recent experiments realizing the sine-Gordon model in a split one-dimensional (1D) BEC, we demonstrate that this system naturally supports various density and phase solitons. We explore the physics using the bosonization technique, in which the phase and density are conjugate pairs, and determine its effective Language equation and the associated equation of motion. We show that in the presence of asymmetry between the two condensates, new solutions beyond those in the sine-Gordon model emerge. We calculate the traveling wave solutions and soliton solutions in this model and determine their corresponding energy densities analytically. Finally, we discuss the relevance of these solutions to the experiments and discuss their observations. This theory does not rely on the mechanism of quasi-particle excitation, which yields the Lee-Huang-Yang correction in higher dimensions, and is thus much more suitable to describe the physics in 1D systems. Since the physical models have already been realized in experiments, this work opens a new frontier for the realization of various soliton and periodic solutions using two coupled condensates.

However, studying $\\mathrm{H}_2^+$ experimentally presents significant challenges: Standard control methods such as laser cooling are not applicable due to the long lifetimes of its rotational and vibrational states. Here we solve this issue by combining buffer gas cooling to quench the $\\mathrm{H}_2^+$ rovibrational excitation with quantum logic operations between $\\mathrm{H}_2^+$ and a co-trapped 'helper' ion to control the molecule's hyperfine structure. This enables us to perform pure quantum state preparation, coherent control, and non-destructive readout, which we use to demonstrate high-resolution microwave spectroscopy in the hyperfine structure of $\\mathrm{H}_2^+$ with a precision of 2 Hz. Our results pave the way for high precision spectroscopy of $\\mathrm{H}_2^+$ in both the microwave and optical domains. Due to the wide applicability of buffer gas cooling, our method provides a general tool for molecular ion species that are hard to control with quantum logic tools alone.         ",

    "abstract": "           Conical wire arrays with different opening angles are used as load of a 400kA, 1kA/ns generator. The differences in opening angle allow the study of the influence of the array geometry on the jet properties. The characterization of the jets is performed using a combination of advanced diagnostic techniques, including moir\u00e9 schlieren deflectometry, visible self-emission spectroscopy, and optical Thomson scattering. The results reveal that, under the experimental conditions, the plasma jets exhibit electron temperatures ranging from $8$ to $17$ eV, increasing along the axial direction. In contrast, the ion temperature decreases from approximately $35$ eV near the base of the jet to about $20$ eV at higher axial positions. The electron density profile peaks at $\\sim 4 \\times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ in the central lower region of the jet and decreases with height exponentially with a characteristic lenght $L_n = $2.86 mm. This behavior is reproducible and independent of the conical array geometry. However, the cone opening angle significantly affect the jet propagation velocity, with larger opening angles producing higher axial velocities ($V_{\\phi=40^\\circ} \\approx 125\\pm3$ km/s, $V_{\\phi=20^\\circ} \\approx 98\\pm5$ km/s), demonstrating that the cone geometry provides effective control over the jet propagation velocity.

This spectral approach bypasses the need for Hamiltonians or energy gaps and remains applicable to both quantum density matrices and classical polarization coherency matrices. The SET framework naturally describes the divergence of inverse temperature near pure, non-degenerate states, consistent with the third law. Using entropy-SET diagrams, we explore spectral bounds in two-, three-, and four-level systems, which reveal physically realizable entropy regions, rank-dependent constraints, and cusp-like features. A Hamiltonian-free parametric spectrum ansatz provides a universal reference curve within these bounds. Furthermore, we derive spectral bounds on ergotropy as a function of entropy and SET, which quantify the maximum extractable work under passive constraints and introduce the notion of structured-states, engineered spectral configurations that saturate these bounds. Our analysis shows that SET serves as a thermodynamically meaningful and operationally relevant quantity for bounding entropy and ergotropy in both classical polarization systems and quantum thermal states.

We demonstrate that the HHG spectra can be drastically altered by tuning the real-space path traced by the laser electric field. This controllability is explained by the dynamical symmetry argument. We also show that both the magnitude and the direction of photocurrent (zeroth order harmonics) can be controlled by varying the frequency, intensity, ellipticity, and relative phase of the two-color laser. Furthermore, the nature of photocurrent is shown to be classified into shift- or injection-current types, depending on the phase of two-color laser. Our findings indicate that even in centrosymmetric electron systems, photocurrent and HHG can be quantitatively controlled by adjusting various external parameters if we utilize multicolor laser with a lower spatial or temporal symmetry.

An alternative, called unconventional photon blockade, can occur under weak nonlinearity by relying on quantum interference between fine-tuned cavities. A serious limitation is the very short antibunching time window, orders of magnitude less than the cavity lifetime. We present a method to achieve photon blockade over a large time window of several cavity lifetimes, even exceeding that of conventional photon blockade, while still requiring only weak nonlinearity. This ``long-lived photon blockade'' (LLPB) occurs when the single-photon Green's function exhibits a zero at a large cavity loss rate, which is satisfied by an exemplary configuration of four coupled cavities under weak driving. Our analytical results agree well with wavefunction Monte Carlo simulations.
