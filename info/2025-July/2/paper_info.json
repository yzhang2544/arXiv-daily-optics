    "abstract": "           The rapid expansion of biomolecular datasets presents significant challenges for computational biology. Quantum computing emerges as a promising solution to address these complexities. This study introduces a novel quantum framework for analyzing TART-T and TART-C gene data by integrating genomic and structural information. Leveraging a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), we classify hotspot mutations, utilizing quantum superposition to uncover intricate relationships within the data. Additionally, a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is employed to estimate molecular ground-state energies through a hybrid classical-quantum approach, overcoming the limitations of traditional computational methods. Implemented using IBM Qiskit, our framework demonstrates high accuracy in both mutation classification and energy estimation on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. These results underscore the potential of quantum computing to advance the understanding of gene function and protein structure. Furthermore, this research serves as a foundational blueprint for extending quantum computational methods to other genes and biological systems, highlighting their synergy with classical approaches and paving the way for breakthroughs in drug discovery and personalized medicine.

    "abstract": "           Modelocked frequency comb lasers have always operated with a single pulse circulating in the laser cavity. This meant that each laser technology had an associated limit on pulse repetition rate. Achieving higher rates required different technology, for example exchanging optical fiber for solid state gain media. However, this is a perceived, rather than a fundamental limit. We demonstrate a new fiber laser design with multiple pulses circulating in the fiber gain cavity with the same high precision as a conventional fiber frequency comb. This has the immediate benefit of bringing mature fiber technology to higher repetition rate frequency combs. More generally, it adds great design freedom to laser engineering, where the laser can be separated into an optical cavity and a gain medium that are combined using standard frequency comb techniques. Fundamental frequency comb performance improvements may even be possible from the filtering intrinsic to our design, or by incorporating high stability cavities directly into the laser itself.

    "abstract": "           Classical Heider balance theory models the evolution of social networks towards balanced states with stress minimization. Triad relationships are classically either balanced or imbalanced. However, real-world relationships often exhibit uncertainty, complexity, and interconnected dynamics that transcend this classical framework, and we will sometimes see the synchronicity of balance and imbalance states. When these triadics are simultaneously balanced and imbalanced, they form superposition and entanglement states that necessitate the introduction of quantum balance. This study introduces a framework that extends classical Heider balance theory from social network analysis by incorporating principles of quantum mechanics. In the framework, each triad is a quantum state of spin systems embedded in various network topologies. Using a quantum transformation operator, we investigate the emergence of balanced and imbalanced states and identify ground and steady states. In the quantum state, developments towards balance will occur by introducing the Hamiltonian within the creation and annihilation operators framework. In these developments, we witness the emergence of superposition and entanglement quantum states with no classical equivalent, which form an uncertainty in the states. When the quantum evolution is a functional temperature, we investigate the emergence of balanced and imbalanced states, analyze ground and steady states, and examine phase transitions as a function of temperature. Our results reveal novel dynamical behaviors unique to quantum social systems and offer a new perspective on collective decision-making, conflict resolution, and emergent order in complex networks.

    "abstract": "           Metasurface lenses are miniature flat lenses that can precisely control the phase, amplitude, and polarization of incident light by modulating the parameters of each unit on the substrate. Compared with conventional optical lenses, they have the advantages of small size, light weight, and high integration, and are the core components of photonic chips. Currently, the hot topics for metasurface lens are broadband and achromatic devices, and there is still less attention paid to the resolution improvement. To break through the diffraction limit and further improve the focusing performance and imaging resolution of metasurface lenses, we use unit cells to perform multi-dimensional modulation of the incident light field. Specifically, in this paper, we combine phase modulation of metasurface lens with a pupil filtering, which has been widely applied to traditional microscopy imaging and adaptive optics and has demonstrated powerful resolution enhancement effects. The integrating of these two technologies will continue to improve the imaging performance of metasurface lenses and thus expanding their application fields. This result preliminarily demonstrates the super-resolution performance of the integrated meta-surface lens. With the comprehensive regulation of multi-dimensional information, such as amplitude, polarization, and vortex, the integrated meta-surface optical lens will achieve more excellent super-resolution focusing and imaging performance, and will also be widely used in the fields of super-resolution imaging, virtual reality, and three-dimensional optical display, due to its characteristics of high resolution, high integration, and high miniaturization.

Previous studies linked rHHG to the 3p -> 3d giant resonance, suggesting a modified four-step model where recolliding electrons are first captured in the autoionizing state before recombining into the ground state, potentially leading to an emission delay associated with the resonance lifetime. While both the 1D-model and TDDFT reproduce experimental spectra, TDDFT reveals that rHHG counterintuitively originates from spin-down 3p states, while spin-up 3d electrons negligibly contribute. The IPA fails to reproduce rHHG, highlighting the significance of electron correlations. Furthermore, TDDFT revealed a correlation induced ~480 attosecond time delay, accompanied by a strong phase shift across the resonance, potentially explaining earlier RABBIT measurements. Our work sheds light on long-standing open questions in rHHG and should advance novel ultrafast spectroscopies of electron correlations and resonances.         ",

Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact, latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management, geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints, and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.

Previous studies in quantum control have shown that, beyond transform-limited pulses, those with antisymmetric spectral phases can drive nonresonant multiphoton transitions with comparable efficiency. However, in resonant multiphoton transitions, the material's spectral-phase response introduces dispersion that degrades nonlinear efficiency. Pre-shaping the pulse to compensate for the material's impulse response can restore and enhance nonlinear interactions beyond the transform-limited case. Yet, is this the only spectral phase that can yield such enhancement? Here, we study sub-10 fs single-pulse four-wave mixing in resonant plasmonic nanostructures using arctangent spectral-phase-shaped pulses. We uncover two distinct enhancement regimes: one compensating for material dispersion, and a counterintuitive regime where the arctangent phase induces an antisymmetric polarization response, driving constructive multiphoton pathway interference. Our theoretical analysis provides clear physical explanation for both phenomena. Notably, it predicts that both enhancement mechanisms scale exponentially with harmonic order, offering a powerful strategy for dramatically enhancing high-order harmonic generation in resonant systems.

    "abstract": "           Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has become a powerful tool for investigating the optical properties of thin films, offering direct access to the complex permittivity in the terahertz range. However, in transmission-based measurements of thin films on thick substrates, multiple reflections and limited time windows can introduce artifacts that obscure resonant features such as phonon modes. Time-domain windowing is widely employed to mitigate these effects, yet systematic guidelines on its application remain scarce. In this work, we organize a practical routine for extracting the complex permittivity from THz-TDS data, focusing on when and how to apply time-domain windowing. The routine incorporates decision points for truncation versus smooth apodization, and emphasizes tailoring the window length and shape to specific signal conditions. We demonstrate the approach using representative measurements on PbTe thin films, highlighting cases in which truncation suffices, where apodization is essential, and how different window functions and lengths influence the resulting spectra. We also propose simple metrics to assess signal continuity and guide window selection. Our results show that the choice of window parameters can significantly affect the accuracy of extracted material parameters, particularly for sharply resonant systems. This work provides an accessible framework for improving spectral fidelity in THz-TDS of thin-film samples.         ",

Understanding their dynamic behavior at the single-particle level is crucial for optimizing performance. However, traditional bulk characterization methods such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), provide only ensemble-averaged data, thereby limiting analytical insights. Here, we introduce a dual-laser optical tweezers approach for real-time, single-particle analysis of HMGs under controlled light exposure. Combining direct imaging and mean-square displacement (MSD) analysis, our method quantifies the precise laser power required for actuation and accurately tracks the particle size. We benchmark our results against an existing dual-laser DLS, demonstrating comparable precision while offering the unique advantage of single-actuator resolution. Thus, our method provides as a robust platform for precise optimization of programmable actuators with applications in soft robotics, microswimmers, and biomedical applications.         ",

The photonic crystal is designed with a checkerboard structure in the $\\left( x\\text{,}% y\\right) $ plane, while the second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $d(z)$, is modulated along the propagation direction as a chains of rectangles with two different periods. This structure can be fabricated by means of available technologies.

Working with IBM Qiskit quantum computing platform, we show that two types of quantum circuits named TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz can outperform the popular EfficientSU2 circuits which have been routinely used in the recent quantum physics literature to run VQE. With their more customizable constructions that allow for more flexibility beyond choosing the types of parameterized rotation gates, both types of new circuit ansatzes used in this work have led to performances that are either better than or at least comparable to EfficientSU2 in the setting of $SU(2)$ matrix models. In particular, in the strong coupling regime of the bosonic model, both TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits provided a better approximation to the exact ground state, while in the supersymmetric model, shallow EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits, with a small number of parameters, attained a comparable or even better performance compared to the much deeper EfficientSU2 circuits with around 8 to 9 times more parameters.

    "abstract": "           Achieving high NV center conversion efficiency remains a key challenge in advancing diamond-based quantum technologies. The generally accepted mechanism for NV formation is that irradiation-induced vacancies become mobile during annealing and are trapped by substitutional nitrogen. However, the suggested mechanism does not consider the presence and role of hydrogen in the diamond and its influence on the NV formation pathway. This is despite ab-initio calculations, which strongly suggest the formation of hydrogen-passivated NV centers during CVD diamond growth. Recent experimental observations showing a strong spatial correlation between NV centers, brown coloration, and the 468 nm luminescence center in as-grown CVD diamonds prompted us to investigate the atomistic origin of these phenomena in the presence of NxVHy-type complex defects. We used hybrid density functional theory DFT calculations and spectroscopic analysis of CVD diamonds grown with varying nitrogen content to investigate defect equilibria during growth. We identified the 468 nm center as the NVH- defect, a hydrogen-passivated NV center, and assigned the characteristic UV-VIS absorption bands at 270 360 and 520 nm to NxVHy complexes. Our findings reveal that hydrogen plays a central role in stabilizing these defects during growth. We further showed that NVHx complex defects dissociate into NV centers and interstitial hydrogen during post-growth irradiation and annealing, complementing vacancy trapping by substitutional nitrogen. These results provide a unified picture of the defect chemistry underlying brown coloration, 468 nm center, and NV formation in CVD diamonds, offering new insights for optimizing diamond synthesis and processing for quantum applications by taking advantage of hydrogens role and dissociation of NVHx complexes.

    "title": "Influence of oxygen-defects on intraband terahertz conductivity of carbon nanotubes",
    "abstract": "           The exceptional charge transport properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) enable numerous ultrafast optoelectronic applications. Modifying SWCNTs by introducing defects significantly impacts the performance of nanotube-based devices, making defect characterization crucial. This research tracked these effects in oxygen plasma-treated SWCNT thin films. Sub-picosecond electric fields of varying strengths and additional photoexcitation were used to assess how defects influence charge carrier transport. Changes in effective conductivity within the terahertz (THz) range were found to be strongly dependent on impurity levels. The plasmon resonance shift to higher THz frequencies aligns with the defect-induced reduction in conductivity and slowed carrier migration within the network. An increase in THz field strength resulted in diminished conductivity due to intraband absorption bleaching. To address the emergence of hot charge carriers, a modified Drude model, which considers non-equilibrium charge carrier distribution via fielddependent scattering rates, was applied. The dominant charge-impurity scattering rate in plasma-treated samples corresponded with an increase in defects. Additionally, the impact of defects on charge carrier dynamics on a picosecond timescale was examined. The modeled plasma-treated SWCNTs wire-grid polarizer for the THz range reveals the potential for multi-level engineering of THz devices to customize properties through controlled defect populations.

    "abstract": "           The particle acceleration and transport process during solar eruptions is one of the critical and long-standing problems in space plasma physics. Through decades of research, it is well accepted that particles with higher energies released during a solar eruption arrive at observers earlier than the particles with lower energies, forming a well-known structure in the dynamic energy spectrum called particle velocity dispersion (VD), as frequently observed by space missions. However, this picture is challenged by new observations from NASA's Parker Solar Probe and ESA's Solar Orbiter which show an unexpected inverse velocity dispersion (IVD) phenomenon, where particles with higher-energies arrive later at the observer. Facing on the challenge, we here report the recent discovery of such IVD structures with 10 solar energetic proton events observed by Solar Orbiter, and then analyze the mechanisms causing this unusual phenomenon. We suggest that shock diffusive acceleration, with respect to magnetic reconnection, is probably a dominant mechanism to accelerate protons to tens of MeV in such events where particles need longer time to reach higher energies. And we determine, innovatively, the physical conditions and time scales during the actual shock acceleration process that cannot be observed directly.         ",

    "title": "Annealing behaviour of charge collection of neutron irradiated diodes from 8-inch p-type silicon wafers",
    "abstract": "           To face the higher levels of radiation due to the 10-fold increase in integrated luminosity during the High-Luminosity LHC, the CMS detector will replace the current Calorimeter Endcap (CE) using the High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) concept. The electromagnetic section as well as the high-radiation regions of the hadronic section of the CE will be equipped with silicon pad sensors, covering a total area of 620 $\\rm m^2$. Fluences up to $\\rm1.0\\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and doses up to 2 MGy are expected considering an integrated luminosity of 3 $\\rm ab^{-1}$. The whole CE will normally operate at -35\u00b0C in order to mitigate the effects of radiation damage. The silicon sensors are processed on novel 8-inch p-type wafers with an active thickness of 300 $\\mu m$, 200 $\\mu m$ and 120 $\\mu m$ and cut into hexagonal shapes for optimal use of the wafer area and tiling. With each main sensor several small sized test structures (e.g pad diodes) are hosted on the wafers, used for quality assurance and radiation hardness tests. In order to investigate the radiation-induced bulk damage, these diodes have been irradiated with reactor neutrons at the TRIGA reactor in JSI (Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana) to 13 fluences between $\\rm6.5\\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $\\rm1.5\\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$. The charge collection of the irradiated silicon diodes was determined through transient current technique (TCT) measurements. The study focuses on the isothermal annealing behaviour of the bulk material at 60\u00b0C. The results have been used to extend the usage of thicker silicon sensors in regions expecting higher fluences and are being used to estimate the expected annealing effects of the silicon sensors during year-end technical stops and long HL-LHC shutdowns currently foreseen with a temperature around 0\u00b0C.

The unit cell of our metamaterial is a ring of metamolecules, each consisting of a metal nanoparticle and a two-level semiconductor quantum dot (QD). Without the QDs, the ring of the unit cell is known to act as an artificial optical magnetic resonator. By adding the QDs we show that a Fano interference profile is introduced into the magnetic field scattered from the ring. This induced interference is shown to cause an appreciable effect in the collective magnetic resonance of the unit cell. We find that the interference provides a means to tune the response of the negative permeability metamaterial. The exploitation of the QD's inherent nonlinearity is proposed to modulate the metamaterial's magnetic response with a separate control field.         ",

    "abstract": "           The interaction between the electric dipole moments of a quantum emitter and a metal nanoparticle gives rise to unique optical properties, such as interference-induced photon correlations, that could be useful for enhanced intensity-based sensing. Using the quantum theory of photodetection, we propose a nanosensor system comprising a quantum emitter and a metal nanoparticle that explores the possibility of utilizing higher-order photon correlations for refractive index sensing. Both the refractive index sensitivity and resolution of the nanosensor, whose scattering spectrum lies within the visible region, are predicted. The sensor is supported by a substrate and driven weakly by a coherent field. By calculating the mean photocount and its second factorial moment resulting from the scattered field of the system, the sensing performance of the intensity and intensity-intensity correlation, are compared at optimal driving wavelengths. The mean photocount was found to be inherently low, inhibiting the role of interference-induced photon antibunching in minimizing the sensor's intensity shot noise. However, a regime in which the noise could be reduced below the shot noise limit is identified, leading to a quantum enhancement in the sensing performance.         ",

    "abstract": "           Estimating expectation values on near-term quantum computers often requires a prohibitively large number of measurements. One widely-used strategy to mitigate this problem has been to partition an operator's Pauli terms into sets of mutually commuting operators. Here, we introduce a method that relaxes this constraint of commutativity, instead allowing for entirely arbitrary terms to be grouped together, save a locality constraint. The key idea is that we decompose the operator into arbitrary tensor products with bounded tensor size, ignoring Pauli commuting relations. This method -- named $k$-NoCliD ($k$-local non-Clifford diagonalization) -- allows one to measure in far fewer bases in most cases, often (though not always) at the cost of increasing the circuit depth. We introduce several partitioning algorithms tailored to different Hamiltonian classes. For electronic structure, we numerically demonstrate the existence of threshold values of $k$ for which $k$-NoCliD leads to the lowest shot counts, though we leave improved partitioning algorithms to future work. We focus primarily on three Hamiltonian classes -- molecular vibrational structure, Fermi-Hubbard, and Bose-Hubbard -- and show that $k$-NoCliD reduces the number of circuit shots, often by a very large margin, and often even for $k$ as small as 2.

In this work, we theoretically demonstrate (e.g., on a (001)-oriented substrate) that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.         ",
