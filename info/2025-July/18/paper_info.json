    "abstract": "           An optical centrifuge is a laser pulse which enables controlled rotational excitation of molecules. Centrifuged molecules rotating with well-defined angular frequencies are ideal candidates to probe many-body quantum systems at the nanoscale. Because the interaction with the quantum environment increases the effective moment of inertia of the embedded molecular probes, the required rotational acceleration of the optical centrifuge must be lowered to accommodate adiabatic spinning. We demonstrate a new design of an optical centrifuge, based on the method of spectral focusing, which enables extremely low, down to zero, rotational accelerations. We discuss the potential of using such constant frequency centrifuge to investigate molecular rotation inside helium nanodroplets.         ",

    "abstract": "           Cold Rydberg atoms, known for their long lifetimes and strong dipole-dipole interactions that lead to the Rydberg blockade phenomenon, are among the most promising platforms for quantum simulations, quantum computation and quantum networks. However, a major limitation to the performance of Rydberg atom-based platforms is dephasing, which can be caused by atomic motion within the trap. Here, we propose a trap for $^{87}$Rb cold atoms that confines both the electronic ground state and a Rydberg state, engineered to minimize the differential light shifts between the two states. This is achieved by combining a fictitious magnetic field induced by optical nanofibre guided light and an external bias magnetic field. We calculate trap potentials for the cases of one- and two-guided modes with quasi-linear and quasi-circular polarisations, and calculate trap depths and trap frequencies for different values of laser power and bias fields. Moreover, we discuss the impact of the quadrupole polarisability of the Rydberg atoms on the trap potential and demonstrate how the size of a Rydberg atom influences the ponderomotive potential generated by the nanofibre-guided light field. This work expands on the idea of light-induced fictitious magnetic field traps and presents a practical approach for creating quantum networks using Rydberg atoms integrated with optical nanofibres to generate 1D atom arrays.

    "abstract": "           Nonlinear frequency conversion offers powerful capabilities for applications in telecommunications, signal processing, and computing. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a promising integrated photonics platform due to its strong electro-optic effect and second-order nonlinearity, which can be exploited through periodic poling. However, conventional poling techniques in x-cut TFLN are limited to minimum period sizes on the order of microns, preventing the efficient generation of interactions involving counter-propagating waves. Here we report scalable periodic poling of x-cut TFLN with periods down to 215 nm and realize devices for counter- and back-propagating phase matching. We estimate conversion efficiencies of 1474 $\\%$/W/cm$^2$ and 45 $\\%$/W/cm$^2$ respectively, and measuring sum frequency generation we confirm that the nonlinear generation takes place in the desired direction. We report spontaneous parametric down conversion for the counter-propagating and, for the first time, for a backward propagating device. This technological advance provides the control of domain geometry in TFLN with an unprecedented precision and leads into the generation of photon pairs with spatial and spectral properties tailored for quantum signal processing, quantum computing and metrology.

The amplifier under test (DUT) is inserted in one arm of a symmetrical Mach-Zehnder interferometer, with an AOM in the other arm. We measure the phase noise of the RF beat detected at the Mach-Zehnder output. The phase noise floor of the amplifier decreases proportionally to the reciprocal of the laser power at the amplifier input, down to $-125$ $\\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=100$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$. The DUT flicker noise cannot be measured because it is lower than the background of the setup.

    "abstract": "           One-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs) are widely used platforms for guiding, filtering, and enhancing light at the nanoscale. Traditionally, designs have favored high refractive index contrast to maximize the photonic band gap (PBG) size. Here, we demonstrate that low-index contrast systems offer a powerful and underexplored route to achieving improved optical functionalities. In particular, we show that low index contrast enables more closely aligned PBGs for transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations, allowing for broadband superposition of TE and TM Bloch Surface Waves (BSWs). As a demonstration of this functionality, we use this approach to design 1DPCs capable of generating planar superchiral fields for enhanced circular dichroism spectroscopy. To realize such structures, we use an automated design framework based on multi-objective genetic optimization. By comparing optimized designs in both high and low index contrast regimes, we find that low index contrast systems yield significantly greater overlap between the TE and TM BSW dispersion relations and exhibit a pronounced reduction in optical anisotropy - both of which contribute to enhanced optical chirality across the operational bandwidth. Furthermore, simulations reveal that these low index contrast structures offer improved robustness to fabrication tolerances and support a wider dynamic range of chiral analyte concentrations. In addition to their optical performance advantages, low-index contrast systems are naturally compatible with polymeric materials, which offer benefits such as low cost, sustainability, and mechanical flexibility. While this work focuses on mode alignment and its consequences for surface wave behavior, the underlying principles have broader implications for polarization-independent photonic technologies, including optical sensing, computing, and spectral filtering.

However, current light detection and ranging technologies struggle to simultaneously achieve high measurement speed, accuracy, and a large non-ambiguity range. Here, we present a time-of-flight optical ranging technique based on a repetition-frequency-modulated femtosecond electro-optic comb and balanced nonlinear cross-correlation detection. In this approach, a target distance is determined as an integer multiple of the comb repetition period. By rapidly sweeping the comb repetition frequency, we achieve absolute distance measurements within 500 ns and real-time displacement tracking at single-pulse resolution (corresponding to a refresh rate of 172 MHz). Furthermore, our system attains an ultimate ranging precision of 5 nm (with 0.3 s integration time). Our method uniquely integrates nanometer-scale precision, megahertz-level refresh rates, and a theoretically unlimited ambiguity range within a single platform, while also supporting multi-target detection. These advances pave the way for high-speed, high-precision ranging systems in emerging applications such as structural health monitoring, industrial manufacturing, and satellite formation flying.

Combining the tight-binding model and the single-particle density matrix approach, we derive a semiconductor Bloch equation under a static-screened Hartree-Fock approximation. This framework characterizes the electron-electron interaction through local Hartree potentials for direct Coulomb interaction and nonlocal Fock potentials for exchange interaction. Distinct confgurations of Hartree and Fock terms yield various approximation methods, including independent-particle approximation, mean-feld approximation, random phase approximation, and excitonic effects. We thoroughly analyze how these approximation methods affect the electronic energy levels, linear optical absorption, and nonlinear harmonic generation. Within excitonic effects, we present the dependence of harmonic generation on the geometric variations of graphene quantum dots (sizes, triangular/hexagonal shapes, and armchair/zigzag edges) and the amplitude and polarization of electric fields. Our findings show that excitonic effects significantly enhance optical responses of graphene nanostructures. For a dot ensemble formed by randomly oriented graphene quantum dots, only odd-order harmonics exist along the polarization direction of the incident light. Crucially, harmonic generation in graphene quantum dots exhibits high tunability via geometric configuration, making them promising candidates for nonlinear optical nanodevices.         ",

Instead, we identify post-selection and the emergence of dark states -- arising naturally through destructive interference in simple photonic settings -- as the essential mechanisms. By avoiding the need for special bath engineering or non-Hermitian symmetries, our approach significantly simplifies the design and architecture, enhances universality, and extends applicability beyond previously studied dimer configurations.

This is essential for applications such as qubit readout, quantum sensing, and communication, where signal fidelity and coherence preservation are critical. Unlike CMOS and HEMT amplifiers used in conventional RF systems, JPAs are specifically optimized for millikelvin (mK) cryogenic environments. CMOS amplifiers offer good integration but perform poorly at ultra-low temperatures due to high noise. HEMT amplifiers provide better noise performance but are power-intensive and less suited for mK operation. JPAs, by contrast, combine low power consumption with ultra-low noise and excellent cryogenic compatibility, making them ideal for quantum systems. The first part of this study compares these RF amplifier types and explains why JPAs are preferred in cryogenic quantum applications. The second part focuses on the design and analysis of JPAs based on both single Josephson junctions and junction arrays. While single-junction JPAs utilize nonlinear inductance for amplification, they suffer from gain compression, limited dynamic range, and sensitivity to fabrication variations. To overcome these challenges, this work explores JPA designs using Josephson junction arrays. Arrays distribute the nonlinear response, enhancing power handling, linearity, impedance tunability, and coherence while reducing phase noise. Several advanced JPA architectures are proposed, simulated, and compared using quantum theory and CAD tools to assess performance trade-offs and improvements over conventional designs.         ",

Specifically, a virtual laboratory activity based on the Bell test has been developed using a commercially available Quantum Optical Simulation Laboratory, QLab. The experiential activity is designed to help undergraduates from diverse academic disciplines understand the counterintuitive yet foundational concept of quantum entanglement. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations conducted over three academic years using carefully designed questionnaires indicated that the virtual laboratory enabled over 80% of students to grasp the complex concepts of quantum entanglement. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the virtual laboratory in making abstract quantum concepts accessible and engaging, regardless of students' prior knowledge of advanced mathematics or technical skills. Despite certain limitations, such as the relatively small sample sizes in the last two semesters, this study offers valuable insights and a practical framework for addressing the challenges of teaching quantum information science in undergraduate curricula, particularly within general education courses designed for both science and non-science students.

    "abstract": "           Diluted bitumen spills in freshwater environments pose significant challenges for detection and remediation due to the complex behaviour of the material once released, rendering traditional oil monitoring techniques, such as aerial surveys and fluorometry, ineffective. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing interdigital capacitive sensors to detect dilbit in water via frequency-dependent impedance measurements. Three sensor designs were fabricated and tested with a vector network analyzer across samples with varying dilbit concentrations. All sensor designs detected electrical changes, exhibiting linear regions and strong potential for quantitative sensing. These findings support the integration of the sensors into autonomous underwater robotic platforms for real-time, distributed monitoring of dilbit spills in freshwater systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Topological photonic systems offer a robust platform for guiding light in the presence of disorder, but their interplay with quantum emitters remains a frontier for realizing strongly correlated quantum states. Here, we explore a ring-shaped Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) photonic lattice interfaced with multiple quantum emitters to control topologically protected chiral quantum dynamics. Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad dynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the bath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters. These interactions lead to rich manybody spin phenomena, including robust coherence, directional energy transfer, and emergent double N\u00e9el ordering, captured by an effective spin Hamiltonian derived from the system topology. We show that topological bound states enable unidirectional emission, protect coherence against dissipation, and imprint nontrivial entanglement and mutual information patterns among the emitters. In particular, we showed that under circularly polarized excitation, the emitters not only inherit spin angular momentum from the field but also serve as transducers that coherently launch the spin-orbit-coupled topological photonic modes into the far field. Our results establish a direct bridge between topological photonic baths and emergent quantum magnetism, positioning this architecture as a promising testbed for studying chiral quantum optics, topologically protected entangled states, and long-range quantum coherence.

    "abstract": "           Field emission under ultra-fast intense terahertz fields provides a promising approach for generating electron bunches with ultrashort pulse duration and high charge densities. It is generally believed that the field emission current described by traditional field emission theory increases dramatically with the applied electric field. However, we conducted extensive field emission experiments using quasi-single-cycle strong-field terahertz radiation at various energy levels and different temperatures and observed an intriguing phenomenon where the emitted charge reached saturation. A novel model is proposed to interpret this phenomenon, which considers the contribution of surface valence electrons and the dynamic replenishment of free electrons from the bulk to the surface. The experimentally observed convex relationship between the emitted charge and terahertz energy is consistent with the model prediction, unlike the concave relationship derived from the traditional field emission formula. In addition, another observed counter-intuitive phenomenon, the inverse correlation between the cathode temperature and saturated emission charge, is also well interpreted by the model. This work offers comprehensive insights into field emission dynamics under ultra-fast intense fields, paving the way for generating electron bunches with unprecedented temporal resolution.         ",

Quantum computers suffer from high readout errors, making quantum simulations with high accuracy requirements particularly challenging. This paper implements practical techniques to reach accuracies essential for quantum chemistry by addressing key overheads and noise sources. Specifically, we leverage locally biased random measurements for reducing shot overhead, repeated settings with parallel quantum detector tomography for reducing circuit overhead and mitigating readout errors, and blended scheduling for mitigating time-dependent noise. We demonstrate these techniques via molecular energy estimation of the BODIPY molecule on a Hartree-Fock state on an IBM Eagle r3, obtaining a reduction in measurement errors by an order of magnitude from 1-5% to 0.16%. These strategies pave the way for more reliable quantum computations, particularly for applications requiring precise molecular energy calculations.         ",

Here, we report mixed quantum--classical simulations showing similar resonances to primarily contribute to valley depolarization in monolayer MoS$_2$. The applied simulation framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure, electron--hole interactions, and carrier--phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations. This enables low-cost excited-state dynamics simulations that are microscopic, non-Markovian, and non-perturbative in the carrier--phonon interaction. The framework furthermore retains explicit information on transient phonon occupancies, through which we show a resonance between the dominant optical phonon branch and the lowest exciton band to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle--Silva--Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.         ",

By allowing the weak field to interfere with the strong trapping beam, we significantly enhance the optical force compared to the case without interference. This amplified optical force enables the detection of the weak field through the particle's motion, reaching picowatt-level sensitivity under moderate vacuum conditions.

    "title": "The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics",
    "abstract": "           The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.         ",

However, to harness the full potential of the photonics platform, several engineering feats need to be accomplished, among those is the quest for a scalable source of pure single photons. While single photon sources can be implemented in a variety of different ways, integrated lithium niobate stands out as a prime contender for a monolithic quantum photonics platform, given its second-order nonlinearity and proven classical scalability. Despite the extensive effort put into developing the platform, integrating suitable photon pair sources remains a hurdle limiting the scalability of quantum photonic systems in lithium niobate. We engineer three-wave-mixing in a nanophotonic lithium niobate device, integrating multiple near-perfect spectrally separable heralded single photon sources. By mixing photons generated via the developed sources, we show bosonic interference between indistinguishable photons, a crucial interaction for many photonic quantum computing protocols. This demonstration of the first proof-of-principle multi-source interference in integrated lithium niobate contributes to developing a truly scalable quantum photonics platform.         ",
