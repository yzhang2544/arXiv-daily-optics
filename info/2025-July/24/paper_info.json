    "abstract": "           This work investigates the fractional time description of a generalized quantum light-matter system modeled by a time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings (JC) interaction. Distinct fractional effects are included by considering two approaches for the power in the imaginary unit of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Additionally, we consider various time modulations in the coupling (constant, linear, exponential, and sinusoidal) and analyze their consequences on population inversion and entanglement. The assumption of fractional order leads to distinct consequences in the considered quantities, such as oscillations with decreasing amplitude around a fixed value or decay to an asymptotic value. The time-dependent couplings influence how these effects occur, eventually resulting in high or low degrees of entanglement. Notably, with sinusoidal coupling, we find that non-periodic behavior is preserved under both treatments of the imaginary unit; however, with decreasing fractional order, the non-periodic dynamics can be suppressed.

    "abstract": "           We propose a unified theoretical study of the recently observed threshold enhancement in top-antitop production at the LHC known as toponium. First, we extend the finite, nonlocal quantum field theories to derive a modified Bethe-Salpeter equation for heavy quark-antiquark bound states, incorporating exp wential regulator functions that render all loop amplitudes ultraviolet finite. We show that nonlocal propagators induce characteristic shifts in the resonance mass and width, which can be contrasted directly with LHC data. Second, we analyse the renormalization group flow of the strong coupling near the top-pair threshold, introducing a holomorphic deformation inspired by unified field-theoretic constructions. We find that the modified $\\beta$-function softens the running of \\(\\alpha_s\\) around \\(2m_t\\), giving a subtle enhancement of the threshold cross-section. Third, we present a systematic comparison of charmonium, bottomonium, and toponium, quantifying differences in binding energies, lifetimes, and production signatures. In particular, the top quark's large width precludes long-lived bound states, so that toponium appears only as a transient threshold resonance. Taken together, our results demonstrate that toponium not only probes nonlocal UV completions of QCD but also offers a novel window onto holomorphic renormalization group dynamics and the broader phenomenology of heavy quarkonium.

Recent developments in integrated optical references and soliton microcombs have paved the way for miniaturizing OFD oscillators to chip scale. Critical to this realization is a rapid tunable frequency comb that is stabilized to the optical references, thereby coherently linking optical and electronic frequencies. In this work, we advance the on-chip OFD technology using an integrated high-speed PZT stress-optic actuator on the SiN soliton microcomb resonator. The integrated PZT actuator tunes the resonance frequency of the soliton-generating microresonator with a bandwidth exceeding 10s MHz and independently adjusts the soliton repetition rate without perturbing the frequency comb offset. Optical frequency division and low-noise mmWave generation are demonstrated by feedback control of the soliton repetition rate through the integrated PZT-actuator, and the soliton microcomb is stabilized to a pair of reference lasers that are locked to an integrated 4-meter SiN coil reference cavity. Our approach provides a fast, versatile and integrated control mechanism for OFD oscillators and their applications in advanced communications, sensing, and precise timing.         ",

    "abstract": "           Silicon nitride Dissipative Kerr Soliton (DKS) microcombs have emerged as a future solution to bring metrological optical frequency comb capabilities into a photonic integrated platform with mass-scale fabrication benefits. Precision applications demand low comb line phase noise as well as high repetition rate stability, but current approaches to achieve this involve complex architectures, multiple lasers, and high-power components, which are challenging to integrate to the chip scale. To achieve this goal, new architectures are needed to simplify the comb generation, actuation, and pump laser requirements, while enabling chip-integrated solutions. Here we demonstrate a greatly simplified stabilized DKS comb architecture with a single laser and a single point electronic control of both the microcomb generation and its stabilization to a coil-resonator reference. The silicon nitride microcomb is integrated with a low power, broadband PZT actuator that is driven by a simple electronic control sequence that generates a soliton and stabilizes it to the 16-meter silicon nitride coil resonator. PZT-enabled control brings flexibility and simplicity to the soliton generation and stabilization using a single CW pump laser, resulting in significantly reduced electronic and optical infrastructure. We demonstrate coil-resonator locking which suppresses the 1 kHz frequency noise by 40 dB over the 35 nm wide comb spectrum, with comb line linewidths as low as 66 Hz and 108 GHz soliton repetition rate phase noise equivalent to -118 dBc/Hz when divided down to 10 GHz. The low power PZT actuator consumes nW bias power and the coil resonator allows flexible dual locking using arbitrary comb lines. These results show a clear path towards full chip integration of stabilized soliton microcombs with simplicity and versatility absent in other schemes.         ",

    "abstract": "           We propose a compact and robust system architecture for soliton microcomb generation, based on two key techniques: direct fiber coupling using high numerical-aperture polarization-maintaining single-mode fibers (high-NA PMFs) and active temperature control of the microresonator. These complementary strategies address two major challenges in microcomb implementation: environmental sensitivity and resonance instability. Building on prior work using single-mode fiber (SMF)-based direct coupling, which demonstrated device miniaturization and partial suppression of thermal drift in coupling efficiency, our PMF-based approach offers enhanced thermal stability and significantly greater robustness to environmental disturbances such as temperature fluctuations and vibration. In our system, precision alignment using microscopes or multi-axis stages is no longer required, enabling a simplified optical setup and stable long-term operation. The direct coupling scheme achieved a coupling efficiency of 57.7% and maintained soliton operation for over 24 hours under external perturbations. In parallel, active temperature control of the microresonator was quantitatively evaluated, reducing the wavelength variation of the pump and auxiliary lasers by 79% and 97%, respectively. This stability enables reproducible soliton generation even in thermally dynamic environments. Comparative experiments with SMF-based direct coupling and lensed-SMF-based free-space coupling systems confirmed the superior performance of the PMF-based design in terms of coupling stability, soliton lifetime, and immunity to environmental noise. The architecture developed in this study lays a strong foundation for future integration into compact modules, paving the way for portable and robust microcomb sources in real-world photonic systems.

Using particle-in-cell simulations, we study the impact of radiation reaction on the dynamics of an underdense plasma target struck by counterpropagating circularly polarized laser pulses. By varying the relative wavelengths and intensities of the pulses, we find a range of parameters where radiation reaction can detrap electrons from the interference beat wave. The resulting charge separation field and the dominant direction of ion expulsion are thus reversed by radiative effects. Based on the electron dynamics during the interaction, we estimate the bounds on the parameter regime where the reversal occurs. The bounds take the form of three simple inequalities which depend only on the wavelength, normalized vector potential, and pulse duration ratios of the two lasers as well as the product of the pulse duration with a dimensionless radiation reaction parameter. Our estimates, which predict whether radiation reaction will change the final ion direction for a given set of laser parameters, broadly agree with the simulated results. Finally, we outline an experimental procedure by which the reversal could be used to observe the transition to radiation-dominated dynamics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Femtosecond (fs) laser sintering enables ultrafast and spatially localized energy deposition, making it attractive for additive manufacturing of metal nanoparticles. However, undesired ablation during fs irradiation of copper (Cu) nanoparticles often disrupts uniform sintering, and the underlying ablation mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the fragmentation and coalescence behavior of Cu nanoparticles subjected to fs laser scanning under fluence conditions relevant to sintering applications. Particle size distributions extracted from scanning electron microscopy reveal a bimodal transformation: emergence of sub-60\\,nm debris and formation of large aggregates up to 750 nm. We evaluate two candidate mechanisms -- Coulomb explosion and hot electron blast -- by estimating electron emission, electrostatic pressure, and hot electron temperature using the Richardson--Dushman equation and two-temperature modeling. Our analysis shows that Coulomb explosion is unlikely under the laser fluence used ($\\sim$27\\,mJ/cm$^2$), as the estimated electrostatic pressure ($\\sim$4 kPa) is orders of magnitude below the cohesive strength of Cu. In contrast, hot electron blast is identified as the dominant ablation pathway, with electron temperatures exceeding 5,000 K and resulting blast pressures above 4 GPa. Thermal modeling also suggests moderate lattice heating ($\\sim$930\\,K), enabling softening and fusion of partially fragmented particles. These results confirm that fs laser-induced ablation in Cu nanoparticles is driven predominantly by nonthermal electron dynamics rather than classical melting or evaporation. Importantly, this work highlights that reducing hot electron temperature -- such as through double-pulse irradiation schemes -- can effectively suppress ablation and expand the sintering window, offering a promising strategy for precision nanoscale additive manufacturing.

    "abstract": "           Diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs), which perform computation using light instead of electrons, offer a promising pathway toward accelerating artificial intelligence by leveraging the inherent advantages of optics in speed, parallelism, and energy efficiency. However, conventional multi-layer D2NNs suffer from inter-layer misalignments that significantly increase system complexity and degrade performance, particularly under visible-light operation where optical alignment is highly sensitive. Here, we present a compact, single-layer dual-wavelength differential D2NN that combines wavelength-division multiplexing with differential intensity detection to enable high-accuracy all-optical classification while substantially reducing hardware complexity. By encoding complementary spatial frequency information at two distinct wavelengths, the proposed network overcomes non-negativity constraints and feature loss inherent to single-wavelength systems. Our numerical experiments achieve outstanding classification accuracies of 98.59% on MNIST and 90.4% on Fashion MNIST using only 40k trainable parameters surpassing the performance of conventional five layer D2NNs (91.33% and 83.67%, respectively) with merely 20% of the parameter count. Furthermore, the network maintains strong performance with only 10k parameters and demonstrates enhanced robustness against random phase perturbations, optical occlusions, and input noise. To best of our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of a single layer diffractive optical network that achieves such high classification accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for compact, robust, and shallow photonic computing architectures.

Recent research on discrete systems showed that this effect can pose a barrier for waves hitting an interface between reciprocal and non-reciprocal systems. Under certain conditions, however, waves can tunnel through this barrier, similar to the tunneling of particles in quantum mechanics. This work proposes and investigates an active acoustic metamaterial design to realize this tunneling phenomenon in the acoustical wave domain. The metamaterial consists of an acoustic waveguide with microphones and loudspeakers embedded in its wall. Starting from a purely discrete non-Hermitian lattice model of the system, a hybrid continuous-discrete acoustic model is derived, resulting in distributed feedback control laws to realize the desired behavior for acoustic waves. The proposed control laws are validated using frequency and time domain finite element method simulations, which include lumped electro-acoustic loudspeaker models. Additionally, an experimental demonstration is performed using a waveguide with embedded active unit cells and a digital implementation of the control laws. In both the simulations and experiments the tunneling phenomenon is successfully observed.         ",

A rapid optical transition at the point where the molecules come to a standstill in the electric field potential irreversibly transfers them into a ~7mK optical dipole trap. For a pulsed Stark decelerated beam, we estimated the per-shot efficiency to be ~0.04% or up to ~103 molecules, with a potential factor 20 improvement when the fields are synchronously modulated with the arriving velocity components. The irreversibility of the scheme allows for larger numbers to be built up over time. Since this scheme does not rely on a closed cycling transition for laser cooling, it broadens the range of molecules that can be used for research on cold molecular chemistry, quantum information, and fundamental interactions in optical traps.

Here we demonstrate phase-adaptive feedback cooling of silica nanoparticles optically trapped in standing-wave potential formed by two co-linearly polarized counterpropagating diffraction-free guided modes in a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber at room temperature. Unlike standard laser intensity- or Coulomb force-based feedback, our approach modulates the relative optical phase between the counterpropagating fundamental modes proportionally to the particle's axial momentum. This generates a Stokes-like dissipative force which effectively damps the center-of-mass motion without introducing excess heating and can also work with uncharged particles. At 2 mbar air pressure, the axial center-of-mass temperature of a 195 nm silica particle is reduced by half upon application of the feedback and to 58.6 K at 0.5 mbar. The measured mechanical spectra agree well with our analytical model, validating the cooling mechanism. We envision this approach will open up pathways towards long-range, coherent control of mesoscopic particles inside hollow-core fibers, offering a fiber-integrated versatile platform for future quantum manipulation.

    "title": "Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD): An Informational Ontology",
    "abstract": "           Quantum mechanics has transformed our understanding of reality, yet deep philosophical puzzles remain unresolved. Is there a consistent way to describe quantum measurement, the emergence of space and time, and the role of observers within one coherent ontology? This paper introduces Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD), an interpretation that places relationships and information, not isolated objects, at the foundation of physics. Unlike traditional views, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, Everett's many-worlds theory, or hidden-variable approaches, RQD denies a single observer-independent reality, instead proposing that facts only become definite within specific observational contexts. It explicitly addresses foundational no-go results, including Bell's theorem, the Kochen-Specker theorem, and the Frauchiger-Renner paradox, by replacing absolute facts with relational, context-dependent truths. RQD rests on five interlocking principles: (1) quantum states are contextual and observer-relative, (2) time emerges from quantum interactions rather than existing as an external parameter, (3) space is constructed from patterns of quantum entanglement, (4) observers emerge as systems with highly integrated information, and (5) classical reality appears through quantum decoherence without special wavefunction collapse. Philosophically, RQD aligns with ontic structural realism, proposing that the fundamental ontology of the universe consists entirely of informational relations. It avoids collapsing into relativism or solipsism by ensuring intersubjective agreement through physical interactions. Ultimately, RQD may offer a unified picture in which quantum mechanics, spacetime, and observers are no longer separate domains but aspects of one interconnected informational web.         ",

They are particularly attractive for multi-pixel, large-scale heterodyne focal plane arrays in space observatories, where a flat metalens array on a silicon wafer can replace individual lenses, greatly simplifying system integration and beam alignment. In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, a superconducting niobium nitride (NbN) hot electron bolometer (HEB) mixer coupled with a silicon-based metalens operating at terahertz frequencies. The metalens phase profile was derived from a finite-size Gaussian beam source using the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral, and its focusing behavior was validated through 2D simulation. Experimentally, the metalens-coupled NbN HEB receiver exhibited a noise temperature of 1800 K at 1.63 THz. The power coupling efficiency from free space to the mixer via the metalens was measured to be 25 %. Measured far-field beam profiles are Gaussian-like with sidelobes below -14 dB. These results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating metalenses with HEB mixers for THz detection, offering a scalable path for compact focal plane arrays in space-based THz instrumentation.

    "abstract": "           Modern medical imaging technologies have greatly advanced neuroscience research and clinical diagnostics. However, imaging data collected across different scanners, acquisition protocols, or imaging sites often exhibit substantial heterogeneity, known as \"batch effects\" or \"site effects\". These non-biological sources of variability can obscure true biological signals, reduce reproducibility and statistical power, and severely impair the generalizability of learning-based models across datasets. Image harmonization aims to eliminate or mitigate such site-related biases while preserving meaningful biological information, thereby improving data comparability and consistency. This review provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts, methodological advances, publicly available datasets, current challenges, and future directions in the field of medical image harmonization, with a focus on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We systematically cover the full imaging pipeline, and categorize harmonization approaches into prospective acquisition and reconstruction strategies, retrospective image-level and feature-level methods, and traveling-subject-based techniques. Rather than providing an exhaustive survey, we focus on representative methods, with particular emphasis on deep learning-based approaches. Finally, we summarize the major challenges that remain and outline promising avenues for future research.         ",

This effect has since been generalized to other anomalous relaxation behaviors even beyond classical domains, such as symmetry restoration in quantum systems. This work demonstrates that resource theories, widely employed in information theory, provide a unified organizing principle to frame Mpemba physics. We show how the conventional thermal Mpemba effect arises naturally from the resource theory of athermality, while its symmetry-restoring counterpart is fully captured by the resource theories of asymmetry. Leveraging the framework of modes of asymmetry, we demonstrate that the Mpemba effect due to symmetry restoration is governed by the initial overlap with the slowest symmetry-restoring mode -- mirroring the role of the slowest Liouvillian eigenmode in thermal Mpemba dynamics. Through this resource-theoretical formalism, we uncover the connection between these seemingly disparate effects and show that the dynamics of thermalization naturally splits into a symmetry-respecting and a symmetry-breaking term.

In this article, we employ state-of-the-art quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT) to study the modifications of the electronic and structural properties of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered materials by the cavity vacuum field fluctuations. We find that cavity photons modify the electronic density through localization along the photon polarization directions, a universal effect observed for all the 2D materials studied here. This modification of the electronic structure tunes the material properties, such as the shifting of energy valleys in monolayer h-BN and 2H-MoS$_2$, enabling tunable band gaps. Also, it tunes the interlayer spacing in bilayer 2H-MoS$_2$ and T$_\\text{d}$-MoTe$_2$, allowing for adjustable ferroelectric, nonlinear Hall effect, and optical properties, as a function of light-matter coupling strength. Our findings open an avenue for engineering a broad range of 2D layered quantum materials by tuning vdW interactions through fluctuating cavity photon fields.         ",

We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat bands emerging exclusively $4n$-site graphs ($n\\in \\mathbf{N}$). We analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.

Using the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.

Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel strategy that enables independent control of optical and mechanical modes in periodically segmented silicon waveguides. Our approach combines two distinct periodic lattices: one with a period shorter than half of the optical wavelength, providing light guiding by metamaterial-induced index contrast, and another that creates a complete phononic bandgap confining acoustic modes. This dual-lattice strategy opens new degrees of freedom to optimize optomechanical confinement and coupling simultaneously. Based on this approach, we experimentally demonstrate remarkably high Brillouin gain of $G_\\mathrm{B}=2673$ W$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$, resulting in a Stokes gain of 3 dB and an anti-Stokes loss of 4 dB with 6.4 MHz mechanical linewidth.

    "abstract": "           Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) provides a new key tool for the control and stabilization of the repetition rate of a cavity soliton frequency comb. It enables direct external control of a given comb tooth of a dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) thanks to its capture by an injected reference laser. Efficient KIS requires its coupling energy to be sufficiently large, and hence both the comb tooth and intracavity reference power must be optimized, which can be achieved through higher-order dispersion that enables phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), where comb teeth are on resonance. However, such a design is highly restrictive, preventing arbitrary use of reference wavelengths away from the DW(s). In particular, for large spectral separations from the main pump the cavity dispersion yields large detuning between comb teeth and their respective cavity resonances, thereby decreasing the coupling energy and rendering KIS to be highly inefficient or practically impossible. Here, we demonstrate an alternative KIS method where efficient synchronization can be tailored at arbitrary modes as needed. Using a multi-color DKS created from multi-pumping a microresonator, a synthetic DW at the second-color wavepacket can be selectively created where otherwise dispersion is far too large for KIS to be experimentally feasible. Since a unique group velocity for both colors exists thanks to cross-phase modulation, the repetition rate disciplining of the secondary color wavepacket through its KIS automatically translates into the DKS microcomb control. We first investigate this color-KIS phenomenon theoretically, and then experimentally demonstrate its control and tuning of the soliton microcomb repetition rate. As a consequence, we demonstrate optical frequency division that is uncoupled from the main pump that generates the DKS.         ",

These microcombs are, however, sensitive to stochastic thermal fluctuations of the integrated cavity refractive index, with its impact becoming more significant as the cavity size becomes smaller. This tradeoff between microcomb noise performance and footprint stands as a prominent obstacle to realizing applications beyond a controlled lab environment. Here, we demonstrate that small footprint and low noise become compatible through the all-optical Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) method. Our study unveils that the phase-locking nature of the synchronization between the cavity soliton and the injected reference pump laser enables the microcomb to no longer be limited by internal noise sources. Instead, the microcomb noise is mostly limited by external sources, namely, the frequency noise of the two pumps that doubly pin the microcomb. First, we theoretically and experimentally show that the individual comb tooth linewidths of an octave-spanning microcomb remain within the same order-of-magnitude as the pump lasers, contrary to the single-pumped case that exhibits a more than two order-of-magnitude increase from the pump to the comb edge. Second, we theoretically show that intrinsic noise sources such as thermorefractive noise in KIS are quenched at the cavity decay rate, greatly decreasing its impact. Experimentally, we show that even with free-running lasers, the KIS microcomb can exhibit better repetition rate noise performance than the predicted thermorefractive noise limitation in absence of KIS.

We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling's advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to $^{40}$Ca$^+$, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.

    "abstract": "           This paper presents a study of the radiation hardness of the hadronic Tile Calorimeter of the ATLAS experiment in the LHC Run 2. Both the plastic scintillators constituting the detector active media and the wavelength-shifting optical fibres collecting the scintillation light into the photodetector readout are elements susceptible to radiation damage. The dedicated calibration and monitoring systems of the detector (caesium radioactive sources, laser and minimum bias integrator) allow to assess the response of these optical components. Data collected with these systems between 2015 and 2018 are analysed to measure the degradation of the optical instrumentation across Run 2. Moreover, a simulation of the total ionising dose in the calorimeter is employed to study and model the degradation profile as a function of the exposure conditions, both integrated dose and dose rate. The measurement of the relative light output loss in Run 2 is presented and extrapolations to future scenarios are drawn based on current data. The impact of radiation damage on the cell response uniformity is also analysed.         ",

    "abstract": "           The results of a study of the dynamics of atomic moments alignment in cesium under optical pumping by linearly polarized resonant light in ultra-weak magnetic field are presented. It is shown that there are alignment components whose relaxation does not depend on spin-exchange broadening. The effect of suppression of spin-exchange relaxation in zero magnetic fields is detected, which is similar in its manifestations to the SERF (Spin-Exchange Relaxation Free) effect observed in orientation signals. This observation is interesting from the standpoint of general theory, since the law of conservation of angular momentum responsible for maintaining orientation in the SERF mode should not guarantee the preservation of alignment under the same conditions. A comparison with theoretically calculated parameters of SERF resonances in orientation is given. A qualitative explanation of the observed effect is presented.         ",

    "abstract": "           This letter presents miniature millimeter wave (mmWave, above 30 GHz) acoustic resonators based on a single-layer thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform. More specifically, we present high performance third-order antisymmetric (A3) mode laterally excited bulk acoustic resonators (XBAR). Compared to prior demonstrations, the proposed platform features a compact footprint due to a smaller lateral wavelength and aperture. We showcase an A3 mode device operating at 39.8 GHz with a high extracted electromechanical coupling (k^2) of 4%, a high 3-dB series resonance quality factor (Q_s) of 97, and a high 3-dB anti-resonance quality factor (Q_p) of 342, leading to a figure of merit (FoM=k^2*Q_p) of 13.7 with a footprint of 32x44 micron^2. To demonstrate frequency scalability, the piezoelectric film thickness is varied while keeping the device layout. As a result, we present a multitude of high-performance devices covering a wide frequency range of 30-50 GHz, validating the proposed XBAR design at mmWave.         ",

    "abstract": "           The unprecedented pace of evolution in nanoscale architectures for cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has posed crucial challenges for theory, where the quantum dynamics arising from the non-perturbative dressing of matter by cavity electric and magnetic fields, as well as the fundamentally non-hermitian character of the system are to be treated without significant approximation. The lossy electromagnetic resonances of photonic, plasmonic or magnonic nanostructures are described as quasinormal modes (QNMs), whose properties and interactions with quantum emitters and spin qubits are central to the understanding of dissipative nano-optics and magnetodielectric cQED. Despite recent advancements toward a fully quantum framework for QNMs, a general and universally accepted approach to QNM quantization for arbitrary linear media remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical framework, based on macroscopic QED and complex coordinate transformations, that achieves QNM quantization for a wide class of spatially inhomogeneous, dissipative (with possible gain components) and dispersive, linear, magnetodielectric resonators. The complex coordinate transformations equivalently convert the radiative losses into non-radiative material dissipation, and via a suitable transformation that reflects all the losses of the resonator, we define creation and annihilation operators that allow the construction of modal Fock states for the joint excitations of field-dressed matter. By directly addressing the intricacies of modal loss in a fully quantum theory of magnetodielectric cQED, our approach enables the exploration of modern, quantum nano-optical experiments utilizing dielectric, plasmonic, magnetic or hybrid cQED architectures, and paves the way towards a rigorous assessment of room-temperature quantum nanophotonic technologies without recourse to ad hoc quantization schemes.

    "abstract": "           Precision measurements of molecules offer an unparalleled paradigm to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The rich internal structure within these molecules makes them exquisite sensors for detecting fundamental symmetry violations, local position invariance, and dark matter. While trapping and control of diatomic and a few very simple polyatomic molecules have been experimentally demonstrated, leveraging the complex rovibrational structure of more general polyatomics demands the development of robust and efficient quantum control schemes. In this study, we present reinforcement-learning quantum-logic spectroscopy (RL-QLS), a general, reinforcement-learning-designed, quantum logic approach to prepare molecular ions in single, pure quantum states. The reinforcement learning agent optimizes the pulse sequence, each followed by a projective measurement, and probabilistically manipulates the collapse of the quantum system to a single state. The performance of the control algorithm is numerically demonstrated for the polyatomic molecule H$_3$O$^+$ with 130 thermally populated eigenstates and degenerate transitions within inversion doublets, where quantum Markov decision process modeling and a physics-informed reward function play a key role, as well as for CaH$^+$ under the disturbance of environmental thermal radiation. The developed theoretical framework cohesively integrates techniques from quantum chemistry, AMO physics, and artificial intelligence, and we expect that the results can be readily implemented for quantum control of polyatomic molecular ions with densely populated structures, thereby enabling new experimental tests of fundamental theories.
