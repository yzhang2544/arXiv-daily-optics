We present results for three- and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gases and ab initio simulations of bulk materials, showing that significant speedups of up to a factor of 2.5 can be achieved by the use of GPUs when several hundred particles are included in the simulations.

Conversely, we reveal that Hermiticity and parity-time $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry phase transition are possible under the temporal $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in time-modulated photonic media. We prove that, for a homogeneously modulated photonic medium with complex-valued modulation, temporal $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is a necessary but insufficient condition for obtaining a real eigenvalue spectrum, giving rise to $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry phase transition. Specifically, the $\\mathcal{PT}$ phase transition critically depends on the contrast between the modulation depth of the real and imaginary parts of permittivity when they are sinusoidally modulated with a $\\pi/2$ phase difference. We generalize the discretized temporal-interface transfer matrix method to a continuous differential operator framework, which facilitates the confirmation of the phase transition condition via Magnus expansion analysis. Full-wave simulations and analytical calculations jointly confirm the occurrence of $\\mathcal{PT}$-transition by examining the scattering behavior of a propagating pulse in such a type of modulated medium. The findings provide a temporal $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric paradigm for controlling Hermiticity and non-Hermiticity in spatiotemporal photonic systems.         ",

However, in WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, charge noise from fluctuations in their local electrostatic environment remains a major obstacle to achieving transform-limited single-photon emission and high photon indistinguishability. Here, we systematically investigate two noise mitigation strategies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation and electrostatic biasing. We demonstrate that hBN encapsulation alone suppresses spectral wandering (from $\\sim$170 $\\mu$eV to $\\sim$40 $\\mu$eV) and narrows emission linewidths (from $\\sim$500 $\\mu$eV to $\\sim$150 $\\mu$eV), while applied bias enables stable Stark tuning over a 280 $\\mu$eV range and further linewidth narrowing down to $\\sim$100 $\\mu$eV reaching the resolution-limited regime. Time-resolved and second-order correlation measurements confirm stable mono-exponential decay and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0) \\approx 0.01$) with no observable blinking.

    "abstract": "           The interplay between viscous and frictional dissipation is key to understanding quantum turbulence dynamics in superfluid $^4$He. Based on a coarse-grained two-fluid description, an original scale-by-scale energy budget that identifies each scale's contribution to energy dissipation is derived. Using the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) model to further characterize mutual friction, direct numerical simulations at temperatures $1.44 \\, \\mathrm{K} \\lesssim T \\lesssim 2.16 \\, \\mathrm{K}$ indicate that mutual friction promotes intense momentum exchanges between the two fluids to maintain a joint energy cascade despite their viscosity mismatch. However, the resulting overall frictional dissipation remains small (compared to the viscous dissipation) and confined to far-dissipative scales. This remarkable feature allows us to define an effective Reynolds number for the turbulence intensity in a two-fluid system, helping to disentangle the effects of Reynolds number and temperature in quantum turbulence. Thereby, simple physical arguments predict that the distance $\\ell$ between quantized vortices (normalized by the turbulence integral scale $L_0$) should behave as $\\ell/L_0 \\approx 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{Re}_\\kappa^{-3/4}$ with the Reynolds number based on the quantum of circulation $\\kappa$. This law is well supported by a large set of experimental and numerical data within the temperature range of the HVBK model. Finally, this new approach offers the possibility of revisiting the ongoing controversy on intermittency in quantum turbulence. It is shown that observed changes in intermittency arise from Reynolds number effects rather than from temperature variations, as proposed in recent studies.         ",

Therefore, the achievement of a desirable and practical plasma with specific characteristics is of particular importance. The frequency of the applied voltage is one of the important factors that play a role in the physical and chemical characteristics. In this research, changes in the density of active species produced in an electrical discharge using a dielectric barrier and air working gas have been investigated from a frequency of 500 Hz to 500 kHz, and by applying a constant voltage of 2 kV, have been investigated. For this purpose, 87 different reactions with specific collision cross-sections were defined in COMSOL Multiphysics. Other parameters, including current-voltage waveform, electric field, and species densitywere evaluated. The results show that under completely identical conditions, the electron temperature distribution changes with increasing applied frequency, and the density of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species RONS decreases, but O shows an increasing trend. It should be noted that the simulation results are in good agreement with previous experimental and simulation reports. These results offer valuable insights into optimizing plasma parameters for different applications, potentially resulting in better treatment outcomes across a range of therapeutic domains.

    "abstract": "           Optimization of metasurface designs for specific functionality is a challenging problem due to the intricate relation between structural features and electromagnetic responses. Recently, many researchers resolved to inverse design of metasurfaces for efficient design parameters based on methods such as parameter optimization, evolutionary optimization and machine learning. In this paper a hybrid quantum machine learning method which uses quantum encoders to enhance the performance of a classical GAN is applied to implement inverse design of a metasurface. Aiming towards angle-independent unidirectional transmission, this approach combines a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to optimize metasurface designs. Incident-angle independent uni-directional transmission has potential applications in efficient solar cells, thermal cooling, non-reciprocal devices, etc. However, it is very challenging to achieve such a metasurface design via forward methods and hence very few studies exist till now in this direction. The methodology employed in this work reduces the data requirement for inverse design by 30% compared to conventional GAN-based methods. More importantly, the developed metasurface designs show high fidelity of 95% with regard to the targeted far-field radiation patterns. We also provide a material look-up table for feasible substitutes of the obtained material design with real materials and yet maintaining performance accuracy. Further, we embed the inverse-designed metasurfaces into Perovskite solar cell layers to demonstrate the improvement in its performance. We observe that the conversion efficiency of the example perovskite solar cell improves by 95% and remains independent of incident angle in the range -60$^\\circ$ to 60$^\\circ$ within the desired frequency range.

    "abstract": "           The photonic spin Hall effect, a hallmark of spin-orbit interaction in light, has emerged as a platform for spin-dependent applications in nanophotonics. Due to intrinsic weak spin-orbit interaction, the resultant shift is tiny with drastically low scattering efficiency, which necessitates signal amplification and high-precision weak measurements for detection - often at the cost of further lowering the intensity. This dilemma between the photonic spin Hall shift and the scattered intensity becomes even more pronounced when the geometry shrinks to the scale of a single particle. Here, we overcome this dilemma by breaking the rotational symmetry of the scatterer to induce multipolar coupling along with strong spin-orbit coupling, resulting in superscattering that boosts the scattering intensity at the maximal photonic spin Hall shift by two orders of magnitude compared to conventional dipolar particle. By tailoring the multipolar interference, the photonic spin Hall shift is enhanced at an angle feasible for direct observation. In doing so, we perform a post-selection-free experiment to bypass the loss in intensity and preserve both the spin Hall shift and the scattering efficiency. We have, for the first time, experimentally demonstrated the predicted photonic spin Hall shift for a standalone particle through measurable differences in far-field scattering intensity in the microwave regime. These findings pave the way for a deeper exploration of the spin Hall effect of light and open new avenues for applications in precision metrology and advanced optical imaging.         ",

These applications drive interest in shifting soliton spectra to frequency bands far detuned from the telecom's C-band pump sources. Recent demonstrations have utilized second-harmonic generation and degenerate optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) to shift soliton combs away from the primary pump. However, these approaches lack the tunability offered by nondegenerate OPOs. This work presents a proof-of-principle demonstration of solitons in a silicon-nitride microresonator-based nondegenerate OPO system with engineered dispersion and optimized coupling rates. By pumping a relatively low-Q resonance in the C-band, we excite a signal soliton comb centred around a far-detuned, high-Q O-band resonance. This process also generates repetition-rate-locked combs at the pump and idler frequencies, with the latter occurring at a wavelength beyond 2$\\mu$m. We demonstrate that the solitons supported by this platform are distinct from other families of dissipative solitons and call them - hyperparametric solitons. They emerge when the narrow-band signal mode, phase-matched under negative pump detuning, reaches sufficient power to drive bistability in the parametric signal. We investigate the properties of hyperparametric solitons, including their parametrically generated background and multisoliton states, both experimentally and through theoretical modelling.

This \"all-geometric\" approach has successfully advanced the manipulation of electrons in condensed matter physics and has sparked growing interest in its implementation within photonics, an area that has traditionally relied on sensitive dynamic phases. However, a major limitation of the topologically protected and inherently robust geometric phase is its lack of reconfigurability. In contrast, mainstream optical computing schemes demand high reconfigurability to compensate for fabrication errors and to support diverse computational tasks. Here, we demonstrate a reconfigurable non-Abelian geometric phase based on the non-volatile phase-change material Sb$_2$Se$_3$. By switching between its crystalline and amorphous states, the number of degenerate subspaces can be actively adjusted. Thus, multilevel second-order matrices and reconfigurable third-order matrices with 3-bit control is realized. For larger reconfigurable rotation angles, tunable braiding operations are also demonstrated. Furthermore, high-dimensional reconfigurable braiding shows promising potential for applications in optical switching.

They can also operate as sensitive two-photon absorption detectors due to the third-order nonlinearity of the heterostructure constituting the active region. The strong two-photon response at room temperature is highly desired in ultrafast optics, where such detectors are used for interferometric characterization of femtosecond light pulses for shape and duration. Another niche is pulse detection in dual-comb ranging. While prior studies have focused on the two-photon response of commercial photodiodes or proprietary semiconductor microcavities for intensity autocorrelation measurements, a systematic analysis of the semiconductor lasers ability to accurately characterize the optical pulse width is missing. To address this niche, here we measure autocorrelation traces of femtosecond pulses with varying durations from sub 50 fs to 250 fs at the common 1.5 $\\mu$m wavelength using AlGaAs and InGaAsP laser diodes designed to operate at emission wavelengths of 0.95 $\\mu$m and 1.3 $\\mu$m, respectively.

In this manuscript, we demonstrate that when eigenstates are fully localized at one boundary, the biorthogonal normalization of left and right eigenstates enables the tunability of skin modes through local potential modulation at the opposite boundary,a phenomenon termed as skin mode tunability, exclusive to non-Hermitian systems. With this technique, we show that certain skin modes are highly susceptible to the local potential, allowing wide-range control over the eigenvalues' imaginary components. We demonstrate these results utilizing a finite system of $L=100$ coupled waveguides and show that the SHE can be engineered and realized on this platform with experimentally accessible parameters. This research sheds new light on the distinctive behavior of non-Hermitian skin modes, and introduces a local tuning approach for skin modes, paving the way for engineering localized skin modes in non-Hermitian systems.

    "abstract": "           The enhancement of power conversion efficiency beyond the theoretical limit of single-junction solar cells is a key objective in the advancement of hot carrier solar cells. Recent findings indicate that quantum wells (QWs) can effectively generate hot carriers by confining charged carriers within their potential wells and by optimizing material properties. Here, we investigate the impact of quantum confinement on the thermodynamic properties of photogenerated hot carriers in p-i-n InGaAs/InAlAs heterostructure diodes, utilizing QW thicknesses of 4 nm, 5.5 nm, and 7.5 nm. The optical properties of these nanostructures reveal significant hot carrier effects at various lattice temperatures, with a pronounced effect noted at lower temperatures. The experimental results indicate that the widest QW exhibits stronger hot carrier effects than the thinner QWs. Additionally, the open-circuit voltage of the samples demonstrates a correlation with the degree of quantum confinement, mirroring trends observed in the quasi-Fermi level splitting of hot carriers. However, the magnitudes recorded exceed the bandgap of the quantum structures, suggesting that this behavior may be influenced by the barrier layer. Furthermore, the short-circuit current of the samples reveals a strong dependence on excitation power, but not on the degree of quantum confinement. This indicates that the majority of the photocurrent is generated in the barrier, with negligible contributions from photogenerated carriers within the QWs. This study provides insights into the role of quantum confinement on the opto-electrical properties of non-equilibrium hot carrier populations in QW structures.         ",

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene offer exceptional conductivity and lower dosage requirements, but face challenges related to high costs and complex fabrication processes. Here, we report a simple and cost-effective one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method for the ultra-high yield growth (7692.31%) of CNTs on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) substrate, forming a three-dimensional CNT@rGO composite with covalent integration. When employed as a conductive agent for lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) cathodes, the CNT@rGO composites significantly enhance rate performance across 1-6C rates, and demonstrate exceptional cycling stability, achieving 96.32% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1C. The synergistic structure facilitates multiple conductive pathways, minimizes catalyst residue (0.52%), and ensures uniform dispersion, providing an effective and cost-efficient solution for next-generation battery technology.

Theoretical results reveal a hybrid plasma wave, called $\\mu$-wave that exhibits ion-acoustic behavior in long-wavelength regime and Langmuir-like behavior in short-wavelength regime. Besides, the Landau damping of $\\mu$-wave is smaller than that of Langmuir wave. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations confirm the theoretical results of instabilities in$e^{-}$-$\\mu^{-}$-ion plasmas. The $\\mu$-wave enables efficient laser amplification by suppressing pump-driven spontaneous instabilities through enhanced Landau damping of Langmuir waves.

    "abstract": "           Compressed ultrafast photography (CUP) is applied to laser breakdown in argon and xenon under pressures up to 40atm to obtain 2D images of the plasma dynamics of single events with a spatial resolution of 250x100 pixels and an equivalent frame rate of 500 GHz. Light emission as a function of position and time is measured through red, green, blue, and broad-band filters. The spatially encoded and temporally sheared image normally used in CUP is now enhanced by the introduction of a constraint given by a spatially integrated and temporally sheared unencoded signal. The data yield insights into the temperature, opacity, the plasma formation process, and heat flow within the plasma and to the surrounding ambient gas. Contours of constant emission indicate that plasmas formed from sufficiently dense gas contract rather than expand despite having a temperature of a few eV. Plasmas formed from relatively low pressure gases such as 7atm argon can radiate with emissivity near unity. Modeling transport and opacity as arising from inverse Bremsstrahlung requires a degree of ionization that strongly exceeds expectations based on Saha's equation even as customarily modified to include density and screening. According to this model, both electrons and ions are strongly coupled with a plasma coefficient >1. During the first few nanoseconds after formation, Stefan-Boltzmann radiation and thermal conduction to ambient gas are too weak to explain the observed cooling rates, suggesting that transport within the plasma dominates its evolution. Yet, thermal conduction within the plasma itself is also small as indicated by the persistence of thermal inhomogeneities for far longer timescales. The fact that plasma is isolated from the surroundings makes it an excellent system for the study of the equation of state and hydrodynamics of such dense plasmas via the systems and techniques described.

The core innovation lies in predicting and assigning the asymptotic limit value for each parameter during iterations based on its own historical data, rather than processing and assigning the entire flow field at once. This approach fundamentally guarantees identical results between serial and parallel computations. Subsequently, a formula for representing the asymptotic limit based on historical data is derived and discretized, yielding a purely algebraic this http URL, the applicability scope of the method is discussed, along with the underlying reasons for its acceleration capability. A quantitative expression for estimating the speedup ratio is also provided. Extensive validation cases were tested, ranging from the simplest inviscid airfoil flow to complex three-dimensional viscous transonic cruise flow around a aircraft, and solving asymmetric linear systems via GMRES. These tests consistently demonstrate significant acceleration effects with speedup factors ranging from 2.5 to 4. Combined with the near-zero computational overhead of the purely algebraic formulation during the solving process and the inherently parallel-compatible pointwise prediction principle, the results strongly indicate that this method is highly suitable for large-scale industrial mesh computations.

The two frequency-calibrated lasers are mixed to create a beat signal at radio frequency to build a portable optical atomic clock (OAC) without an optical frequency comb (OFC). Removal of the OFC improves the portability of OAC, while the dual interferometer setup enhances the one second stability to $1.3\\times 10^{-15}$, which is better than the current portable OAC. Thermal noise in the OAC is minimized by choosing the double-lambda atomic scheme with co-propagating laser fields.

Precision experiments with heavy atoms and molecules can provide stringent constraints on CP violation via searches for effects due to permanent electric dipole moments and other CP-odd properties in leptons, hadrons, and nuclei. Radioactive molecules have been proposed as highly sensitive probes for such searches, but experiments with most such molecules have so far been beyond technical reach. Here we report the first production and spectroscopic study of a gas-phase actinium molecule, $^{227}$AcF. We observe the predicted strongest electronic transition from the ground state, which is necessary for efficient readout in searches of symmetry-violating interactions. Furthermore, we perform electronic- and nuclear-structure calculations for $^{227}$AcF to determine its sensitivity to various CP-violating parameters, and find that a realistic, near-term experiment with a precision of 1 mHz would improve current constraints on the CP-violating parameter hyperspace by three orders of magnitude.

The lossy electromagnetic resonances of photonic, plasmonic or magnonic nanostructures are described as quasinormal modes (QNMs), whose properties and interactions with quantum emitters and spin qubits are central to the understanding of dissipative nano-optics and magnetodielectric cQED. Despite recent advancements toward a fully quantum framework for QNMs, a general and universally accepted approach to QNM quantization for arbitrary linear media remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical framework, based on macroscopic QED and complex coordinate transformations, that achieves QNM quantization for a wide class of spatially inhomogeneous, dissipative (with possible gain components) and dispersive, linear, magnetodielectric resonators. The complex coordinate transformations effectively convert the radiative losses into non-radiative material dissipation, and via a suitable transformation that reflects all the losses of the resonator, we define creation and annihilation operators that allow the construction of modal Fock states for the joint excitations of field-dressed matter. By directly addressing the intricacies of modal loss in a fully quantum theory of magnetodielectric cQED, our approach enables the exploration of modern, quantum nano-optical experiments utilizing dielectric, plasmonic, magnetic or hybrid cQED architectures, and paves the way towards a rigorous assessment of room-temperature quantum nanophotonic technologies without recourse to ad hoc quantization schemes.

Mathematically, this means that their spectral density, $\\tilde{\\rho}({\\bf k})$, approaches zero for low wavenumber, $|\\textbf{k}|$. Crystalline lattices are hyperuniform, as are certain quasicrystals, maximally random jammed packing of spheres, and electrons in the fractional quantum Hall state. Stealthy-hyperuniformity is an even stronger constraint on the spectral density: it requires that $\\tilde{\\rho}({\\bf k})$ is strictly zero in a finite range of wavevectors around $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$, called the stealthy regime, or exclusion region. Since the degree of scattering by disorder is, to leading order, proportional to $\\tilde{\\rho}({\\bf k})$, waves propagating through such structures may do so without scattering for sufficiently long wavelengths and short distances. Here, we measure scattering by disorder in photonic crystal slabs with stealthy-hyperuniform disorder by measuring the linewidths of the photonic bands. We observe the transition between the stealthy and non-stealthy regimes, marked by a sharp increase in linewidth. We also observe the effects of multiple scattering in the stealthy regime, which implies diminishing transparency. Moreover, we show that residual single scattering in the stealthy regime arises from an intrinsically non-Hermitian effect: propagating light has a complex effective mass due to radiative loss out of the slab.

In particular, we consider the standard setup of HOME, which consists of two-photon sources firing single photons from the opposite sides of a 50/50 beam splitter and two perfect detectors placed at the output ports to record photodetection events. For single-photon sources, we consider two special cases: (1) two excited two-level atoms and (2) two atom-cavity setups with initially present single photons in both cavities. For both cases, we report analytic results as well as quantum jump-based Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the signatures of these single-photon sources on the HOME under different working conditions (for example, strong- and weak-coupling regimes of cavity quantum electrodynamics). Our results may have interesting applications in linear optics quantum computing as well as in protocols that test the indistinguishability of single-photon sources.         ",

However, real-world chemical systems often exhibit complex characteristics, including varying charges, spins, and environments. We introduce OrbitAll, a geometry- and physics-informed deep learning framework that can represent all molecular systems with electronic structure information. OrbitAll utilizes spin-polarized orbital features from the underlying quantum mechanical method, and combines it with graph neural networks satisfying SE(3)-equivariance. The resulting framework can represent and process any molecular system with arbitrary charges, spins, and environmental effects. OrbitAll demonstrates superior performance and generalization on predicting charged, open-shell, and solvated molecules, while also robustly extrapolating to molecules significantly larger than the training data by leveraging a physics-informed architecture. OrbitAll achieves chemical accuracy using 10 times fewer training data than competing AI models, with a speedup of approximately $10^3$ - $10^4$ compared to density functional theory.         ",

For combinatorial optimization prevalent in genomics, we discuss the limitations of theoretical complexity in practice and suggest carefully identifying problems genuinely suited for quantum acceleration. Given the competition from excellent classical approximate solvers, quantum computing could offer a speedup in the near future only for a specific subset of hard enough tasks in assembly, gene selection, and inference. These tasks need to be characterized by core optimization problems that are particularly challenging for classical methods while requiring relatively limited variables. We emphasize rigorous empirical validation through runtime scaling analysis to avoid misleading claims of quantum advantage.

The proposed formula is general and applicable to an arbitrary number of oscillators described by a rather general class of potential energy functions (not necessarily polynomials). Starting from the exact path integral expression of the partition function, we introduce a time-dependent Gaussian approximation for the potential contribution and, then, invoke a principle of minimal sensitivity to minimize the error. This leads to a system of coupled nonlinear equations whose solution yields the optimal parameters of the gaussian approximation. The resulting approximate partition function accurately reproduces thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy, average energy, and specific heat -- even at zero temperature -- with typical errors of only a few percent. We illustrate the performance of our approximate formula with numerical results for systems of up to ten coupled anharmonic oscillators. These results are compared to \"exact\" numerical results obtained via Hamiltonian diagonalization for small systems and Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations for larger ones.         ",

The only assumed inputs are the multi-time probability distributions estimated from the results of sequential measurements of quantum observables; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. In the concluding Part II of the paper, we carry out the deduction of the formalism from the phenomenological inputs described in Part I. We show that the resulting formalism exhibits an affinity with Hilbert spaces, and we derive an explicit representation in terms of those mathematical structures. Analogues of the obtained elementary building blocks -- such as projection operators -- are readily identifiable within the standard formalism. However, once these building blocks are assembled according to the blueprint of the deduced bi-trajectory formalism, it becomes evident that the new and the standard formalisms differ substantially at the conceptual level. These differences do not negate the fact that both formalisms are in perfect agreement with respect to empirically testable predictions. Rather, the emergence of a novel, non-standard formulation should be seen as a relatively rare opportunity to reassess, from a fresh perspective, some of the long-standing foundational issues in the theory. The hope is that the new approach may prove more successful in addressing problems that have resisted resolution within the established theoretical framework.         ",

Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum transport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple model to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we find that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.         ",

In this context, we present a monometallic Ru(II) complex (Ru-1), based on the 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole moiety, acting as a highly selective luminescent probe for \\ce{CN^-} recognition in pure water. Additionally, Ru-1 also functions as an efficient sensor for \\ce{F^-}, \\ce{AcO^-}, and \\ce{H2PO4^-} ions, along with \\ce{CN^-}, when acetonitrile is used as the solvent system. The binding constant ($K_b$) and detection limit (LoD) for \\ce{CN^-} were determined to be $3.05 \\times 10^6$~M$^{-1}$ and 12.8~nM, respectively, in water. The close proximity of the N--H site to the Ru(II) center, along with its notable acidity, were identified as the primary factors responsible for the high selectivity of Ru-1 toward \\ce{CN^-} in aqueous media. Job's plots and density functional theory (DFT) analyses were conducted to support the anion binding mechanism. Furthermore, time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) spectroscopy was employed to evaluate the \\ce{CN^-}-induced emission lifetime change of Ru-1 in water. To explore practical applicability, the Ru-1 probe was developed into paper-based strips capable of detecting \\ce{CN^-} ions in the millimolar range via the naked eye under 365~nm UV illumination. It was also effectively applied for the detection of \\ce{CN^-} in human breast cancer MCF-7 cell lines and natural food sources, such as apple seeds and sprouting potatoes.         ",

These defect-localized modes are expected to have robust properties owing to their topological origin. In this work, we show how to obtain topological defect modes in a lattice possessing both mirror and chiral symmetry. The defect is obtained by endowing a plaquette with a non-trivial gauge flux. We show that the bulk-defect correspondence is satisfied by introducing appropriate topological invariants. Moreover, the topological defect modes are shown to be highly robust to the introduction of symmetry-preserving disorder. The model is then realized in an acoustic system made of a network of tubes, and the presence of topological defect mode is experimentally clearly demonstrated.         ",

    "abstract": "           Wave front sensing of the surface of equal phase for a propagating electromagnetic wave is a vital technology in fields ranging from real time adaptive optics, to high accuracy metrology, to medical optometry. We have developed a new method of wavefront sensing that makes a direct measurement of the electromagnetic phase distribution, or path-length delay, across an optical wavefront. The method is based on techniques developed in radio astronomical interferometric imaging. The method employs optical interferometry using a 2-D aperture mask, a Fourier transform of the interferogram to derive interferometric visibilities, and self-calibration of the complex visibilities to derive the voltage amplitude and phase gains at each hole in the mask, corresponding to corrections for non-uniform illumination and wavefront distortions across the aperture, respectively. The derived self-calibration gain phases are linearly proportional to the electromagnetic path-length distribution to each hole in the aperture mask, relative to the path-length to the reference hole, and hence represent a wavefront sensor with a precision of a small fraction of a wavelength. The method was tested at $\\lambda=400\\,$nm at the Xanadu optical bench at the ALBA synchrotron light source using a rotating mirror to insert tip-tilt changes in the wavefront. We reproduce the wavefront tilts to within $0.1''$ ($5\\times 10^{-7}$~radians). We also derive the static metrology though the optical system for non-planar wavefront distortions to $\\sim \\pm1$~nm repeatability. Lastly, we derive frame-to-frame variations of the wavefront tilt due to vibrations of the optical components which range up to $\\sim 0.5\"$. These variations are relevant to adaptive optics applications. Based on the measured visibility phase noise after self-calibration, we estimate an rms path-length precision per 1~ms exposure of 0.6 nm.         ",

    "abstract": "           Many quantum technologies require a precise electrical current standard that can only be achieved with expensive cryogenics, or through the secondary standards, such as resistance or voltage. Silicon-based charge pumps could provide such a standard in an inherently scalable way, through their compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication methods. However, coherent quantized charge transfer has so far been demonstrated only in nanoscale devices that are custom-fabricated in academic cleanrooms or research technology foundries. Here, we show that a CMOS device manufactured with commercial 22-nm process node can be used to define a quantum current standard in the International System of Units (SI). We measure an accuracy of (1.2 +/- 0.1)E-3 A/A at 50 MHz with reference to SI voltage and resistance standards in a pumped helium system. We then propose a practical monolithic CMOS chip that incorporates one million parallel connected charge pumps along with on-chip control electronics. This chip could be operated as a table-top primary standard that can be easily integrated with CMOS electronics, generating quantum currents of up to microampere levels.         ",

However, a comprehensive understanding of USPL-induced filaments remains elusive due to the complexity of their dynamics and insufficient imaging techniques to accurately capture them. In this study, we propose a novel methodology to measure the transient complex refractive index of filaments through polarization analysis of a probe pulse. To our knowledge, this approach achieves, for the first time, accurate three dimensional mapping of the ultrafast fluctuations in complex refractive index. The present findings provide critical insights into the ablation mechanisms driven by USPLs, essential for optimizing laser parameters in micro- and nanoprocessing. Moreover, this work contributes valuable experimental data to condensed matter and computational physics by elucidating the physical properties of USPL-irradiated regions.         ",

However, existing ONN architectures, typically based on cascaded unitary transformations such as Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes, face inherent scalability limitations due to spatial encoding, which causes optical components and system complexity to scale quadratically with network size. A promising solution to this challenge is the use of synthetic dimensions to enhance scalability, though experimental demonstration has remained scarce. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of an all-optical, highly scalable, programmable ONN operating in a time-synthetic dimension. By implementing a time-cycle computation paradigm analogous to gate cycling in conventional spatial photonic circuits, our approach achieves a gate count surpassing that of state-of-the-art programmable photonic processors. Unlike conventional ONN architectures that rely on real-space wave interferences, our framework exploits time-reflection and time-refraction to perform computations, fundamentally eliminating backscattering errors through causality constraints. To bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we introduce an in-situ training framework that dynamically adapts to experimental errors, achieving performance exceeding traditional in silico learning paradigms. Our synthetic-dimension-based approach provides a compact, scalable, backscattering-free, and programmable neuromorphic computing architecture, advancing the potential for next-generation photonic AI systems.

We experimentally demonstrate up to a ninefold reduction in decoherence of warm cesium vapor, achieving simultaneous protection from both spin-exchange relaxation and partial depolarization from coated cell walls. The technique substantially enhances the spin precession quality factor and maintains a stable gyromagnetic ratio independent of spin polarization, even under frequent collisions.

We evaluate the acoustic and thermal performance of walls constructed with clay metaBricks, focusing on sound transmission loss and heat resistance. Both the finite element method and experimental analysis were employed to highlight the performance of metaBricks compared to standard clay bricks. Results show that metaBricks significantly enhance acoustic and thermal insulation, achieving an attenuation of $20$ \\si{dB} across a broad frequency range from $500$ to $2500$ \\si{Hz} and an $8$\\% increase in thermal resistance. However, compressive strength is reduced by $33$\\%, though it remains above the standard requirements for building materials.

The only assumed inputs are obtained through sequential probing of quantum systems; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. We demonstrate that it is indeed possible to derive, on this basis, a complete and fully functional formalism rooted in the structures of Hilbert spaces. However, the resulting formalism--the bi-trajectory formalism--differs significantly from the standard state-focused formulation. In Part I of the paper, we analyze the outcomes of various experiments involving sequential measurements of quantum observables. These outcomes are quantitatively described by phenomenological multi-time probability distributions, estimated from experimental data. Our first conclusion is that the theory describing these experiments must be non-classical: the measured sequences cannot be interpreted as sampling of a uni-trajectory representing the system's observable. The non-classical nature of the investigated systems manifests in a range of observed phenomena, including quantum interference, the quantum Zeno effect, and uncertainty relations between the measured observables.

    "abstract": "           Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side on timescales comparable to the phonon period. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum--classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.

Here, we present an intrinsic static/dynamic triboelectric sensor (iSD Sensor) capable of reliably perceiving both continuous static pressure and transient mechanical shocks through a DC/AC signal decoupling strategy. By pairing hydrophobic expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) with elastic conductive sponge, a pressure-adaptive triboelectric interface is formed, where microscale and large-scale separations enable static and dynamic pressure sensing, respectively. Furthermore, by employing a charge excitation strategy, the device delivers enhanced voltage outputs over 25X in static and 15X in dynamic modes. Combined with a 3D gradient conductive sponge structure, the sensor achieves multi-region sensitivities of 34.7 V/kPa (static) and 48.4 V/kPa (dynamic) under low pressure (less than 1.8 kPa), and a detection limit as low as 6.13 Pa. By perceiving continuous static pressure and transient shocks applied by the human hand, the iSD Sensor enables robotic arm control via proportional grasping and dynamic, trigger-based sign language communication.

    "abstract": "           High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels.
