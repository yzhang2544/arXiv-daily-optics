    "abstract": "           Nonlinear processes lie at the heart of many technologies such as frequency converters and entangled photon sources. Historically, observation and manipulation of these processes, for instance through nanostructures, has been limited to optical and lower frequencies. Recently, however, second-order nonlinear processes which couple X-ray and optical photons have been observed and used to probe the electronic structure and optical response of materials. Observing and controlling these processes remains challenging due to their low efficiency and the difficulty of fabricating devices with spatial features on the scale of X-ray wavelengths. Here, we show how optical nanostructures can be used to manipulate X-ray/optical nonlinear processes, using a quantum theory which describes these second-order nonlinear interactions. As an example, we show how photonic crystals shape both the spectral and spatial characteristics of X-rays emitted through X-ray to optical parametric down-conversion, leading to a fill-factor-normalized rate enhancement of 2.2 over an unstructured medium, in addition to control over the directionality of X-ray emission. The ability to control X-ray nonlinear processes may lead to more monochromatic, heralded X-ray sources, enhanced ghost imaging of lattice and electronic dynamics, and imaging and spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit. Our framework illuminates a path towards controlling quantum optical effects at X-ray frequencies.         ",

    "abstract": "           Heterogeneous networks provide a universal framework for extracting subsystem-level features of a complex system, which are critical in graph colouring, pattern classification, and motif identification. When abstracting physical systems into networks, distinct groups of nodes and links in heterogeneous networks can be decomposed into different modes of multipartite networks, allowing for a deeper understanding of both intra- and inter-group relationships. Here, we develop heterogeneous network modelling of wave scattering to engineer multiphase random heterogeneous materials. We devise multipartite network decomposition determined by material phases, which is examined using uni- and bi-partite network examples for two-phase multiparticle systems. We show that the directionality of the bipartite network governs the phase-sensitive alteration of microstructures. The proposed modelling enables a network-based design to achieve phase-sensitive microstructural features, while almost preserving the overall scattering response. With examples of designing quasi-isoscattering stealthy hyperuniform materials, our results provide a general recipe for engineering multiphase materials for wave functionalities.         ",

However, traditional tactile technologies based on total internal reflection (TIR) and frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) - such as those used in touchscreen systems - face significant limitations. These include reliance on multiple infrared light sources and cameras, as well as poor adaptability to the complex, curved geometries often found in robotic systems. To address these challenges, we recently introduced OptoSkin, an advanced optical tactile sensor based on direct Time-of-Flight (ToF) technology, enabling touch and pressure detection. In this study, we investigate how specific material properties, particularly light scattering, influence the sensitivity of contact point detection under direct ToF sensing. Four materials with distinct scattering coefficients were selected to assess their impact on signal quality across different contact scenarios involving various target surfaces.         ",

    "abstract": "           The interaction between acoustic waves and turbulent grazing flow over an acoustic liner is investigated using Lattice-Boltzmann Very-Large-Eddy simulations. A single-degree-of-freedom liner with 11 streamwise-aligned cavities is studied in a grazing flow impedance tube. The conditions replicate reference experiments from the Federal University of Santa Catarina. The influence of grazing flow (with a centerline Mach of 0.32), acoustic wave amplitude, frequency, and propagation direction relative to the mean flow is analysed. Impedance is computed using both the in-situ and the mode-matching methods. The in-situ method reveals strong spatial variations; however, averaged values throughout the sample show minimal differences between upstream and downstream propagating waves, in contrast to the mode-matching method. Flow analyses reveal that the orifices displace the flow away from the face sheet, with this effect amplified by acoustic waves and dependent on the wave propagation direction. Consequently, the boundary layer displacement thickness (${\\delta}$*) increases along the streamwise direction compared to a smooth wall and exhibits localised humps downstream of each orifice. The growth of ${\\delta}$* alters the flow dynamics within the orifices by weakening the shear layer at downstream positions. This influences the acoustic-induced mass flow rate through the orifices, suggesting that acoustic energy is dissipated differently along the liner. The role of near-wall flow features highlights the need to consider a spatially evolving turbulent flow when studying the acoustic-flow interaction and measuring impedance. The spatial development of the turbulent flow may also partly explain the upstream-downstream impedance differences, as current eduction methods do not account for it.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have been investigated as a method for generating synthetic data with the goal of augmenting training data sets for neural networks. This is especially relevant for financial time series, since we only ever observe one realization of the process, namely the historical evolution of the market, which is further limited by data availability and the age of the market. However, for classical generative adversarial networks it has been shown that generated data may (often) not exhibit desired properties (also called stylized facts), such as matching a certain distribution or showing specific temporal correlations. Here, we investigate whether quantum correlations in quantum inspired models of QGANs can help in the generation of financial time series. We train QGANs, composed of a quantum generator and a classical discriminator, and investigate two approaches for simulating the quantum generator: a full simulation of the quantum circuits, and an approximate simulation using tensor network methods. We tested how the choice of hyperparameters, such as the circuit depth and bond dimensions, influenced the quality of the generated time series. The QGAN that we trained generate synthetic financial time series that not only match the target distribution but also exhibit the desired temporal correlations, with the quality of each property depending on the hyperparameters and simulation method.

    "title": "Protected quantum gates using qubit doublons in dynamical optical lattices",
    "abstract": "           Quantum computing represents a central challenge in modern science. Neutral atoms in optical lattices have emerged as a leading computing platform, with collisional gates offering a stable mechanism for quantum logic. However, previous experiments have treated ultracold collisions as a dynamically fine-tuned process, which obscures the underlying quantum- geometry and statistics crucial for realising intrinsically robust operations. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a purely geometric two-qubit swap gate by transiently populating qubit doublon states of fermionic atoms in a dynamical optical lattice. The presence of these doublon states, together with fermionic exchange anti-symmetry, enables a two-particle quantum holonomy -- a geometric evolution where dynamical phases are absent. This yields a gate mechanism that is intrinsically protected against fluctuations and inhomogeneities of the confining potentials. The resilience of the gate is further reinforced by time-reversal and chiral symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We experimentally validate this exceptional protection, achieving a loss-corrected amplitude fidelity of $99.91(7)\\%$ measured across the entire system consisting of more than $17'000$ atom pairs. When combined with recently developed topological pumping methods for atom transport, our results pave the way for large-scale, highly connected quantum processors. This work introduces a new paradigm for quantum logic, transforming fundamental symmetries and quantum statistics into a powerful resource for fault-tolerant computation.         ",

    "abstract": "           Multiferroic hexagonal h-Lu0.6Sc0.4FeO3 single crystals with non-collinear spins were studied using the THz and Raman scattering spectroscopies and ellipsometry. Antiferromagnetic resonances, or magnons, were found at about 0.85 THz and 1.2 THz. These magnons harden as temperature increases and disappear above 130 K. This behavior is consistent with the magnetic susceptibility and a phase transition to a previously reported weak ferromagnetic state. A strong dichroism at the resonance with the AFM doublet has been observed at zero external magnetic field using both conventional circular polarization and THz vector vortex beams. This observation is attributed to the strong altermagnetic properties of h-Lu0.6Sc0.4FeO3 with a broken PT symmetry. The splitting of the magnon doublet in an external magnetic field applied long the c axis yields a g-factor of 3.0 for the Fe3+ ions. Raman spectra of the optical phonons revealed a Fano-type asymmetry due to their interaction with a continuum of polar excitations. Electronic transitions were studied with ellipsometry and the results were compared with the modelled using DFT+eDMFT.         ",

    "abstract": "           Wavelength calibration is a key factor for high-resolution spectroscopic measurements for precision radial velocities. Hollow-cathode lamps (e.g., ThAr), absorption cells (e.g., iodine cell), dielectric coated Fabry-P\u00e9rot etalons and laser frequency combs have been implemented over the years for precise wavelength calibration and wavelength drift measurements. However, due to their various impediments as wavelength calibrators, investigations of alternative methods remain of prime interest. In this paper, we examined the feasibility of low-cost (~ $1000) commercially available solid fused silica etalon with a broadband metallic coating as a calibrator. We studied the behaviour for two cavity spacings (free spectral range of 1/cm and 0.5/cm) with temperature from theoretical derivation and experimental data. Our setup had a temperature stability of 0.8 mK for a calibrator system using an off-the-shelf dewar flask with active stabilisation. Our result from radial velocity drift measurements demonstrated that such a calibration system is capable of providing higher signal-to-noise calibration and better nightly drift measurement relative to ThAr in the wavelength range between 470 nm and 780 nm. A similar result has been previously found for Fabry-P\u00e9rot etalons, and although the metalon solution lacks the efficiency of an etalon, it does offers a cost-effective broadband solution, which should be less prone to aging relative to complex dielectric mirror coatings. Nonetheless, long-term monitoring is required to understand the metalon behaviour in detail.         ",

Here, we reveal that quantum confinement persists in these flat, reconstructed regions. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy uncovers multiple, finely-spaced interlayer exciton states (~ 1 meV separation), and correlated emission lifetimes spanning sub-nanosecond to over 100 nanoseconds across a 10 meV energy window. Cascade-like transitions confirm that these states originate from a single potential well, further supported by calculations. Remarkably, at high excitation rates, we observe transient suppression of emission followed by gradual recovery, a process we term \"quantum siphoning\".

With the optimized laser system characterized by this technique, we achieve an average single-qubit Clifford gate fidelity of up to $F_1^2 = 0.99964(3)$ when simultaneously driving 3000 optical qubits with a homogeneous Rabi frequency ranging from \\SI{10}{Hz} to $\\sim$$\\SI{1}{kHz}$. This result represents the highest single optical-qubit gate fidelity for large number of atoms.         ",

Shot-by-shot characterization of the X-FEL pulses is crucial for analysis of many experiments as well as tuning the X-FEL performance. However, for the weak pulses found in advanced configurations, e.g. those needed for coherent, two-pulse studies of quantum materials, there is no current method for reliably resolving pulse profiles. Here we show that a physics-based U-net model can reconstruct the individual pulse power profiles for sub-picosecond pulse separation without the need for simulations. Using experimental data from weak X-FEL pulse pairs, we demonstrate we can learn the pulse characteristics on a shot-by-shot basis when conventional methods fail.         ",

    "abstract": "           This paper presents the findings of pedagogical research on the efficacy of a virtual laboratory platform in general education courses on quantum information science. Specifically, a virtual laboratory activity based on the Bell test has been developed using a commercially available Quantum Optical Simulation Laboratory, QLab. The experiential activity is designed to help undergraduates from diverse academic disciplines understand the counterintuitive yet foundational concept of quantum entanglement. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations conducted over three academic years using carefully designed questionnaires indicated that the virtual laboratory enabled over 80% of students to grasp the complex concepts of quantum entanglement. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the virtual laboratory in making abstract quantum concepts accessible and engaging, regardless of students' prior knowledge of advanced mathematics or technical skills. Despite certain limitations, such as the relatively small sample sizes in the last two semesters, this study offers valuable insights and a practical framework for addressing the challenges of teaching quantum information science in undergraduate curricula, particularly within general education courses designed for both science and non-science students.

    "abstract": "           First-order electric dipole response functions are implemented for cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) generalizations of Hartree-Fock (HF) and Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) in order to assess the degree to which static molecular response properties are impacted by interactions between electronic degrees of freedom and an optical cavity mode. Isotropically averaged static electric dipole polarizability tensors from QED-HF and QED-DFT are found to be somewhat insensitive to the presence of the cavity under realistic single-molecule coupling strengths. In contrast, the first hyperpolarizability tensor computed using QED-HF can be significantly modified by the cavity, depending on the relative orientation of the molecule and cavity mode polarization axis. For example, compared to the isolated molecule case, the isotropically averaged hyperpolarizability for $p$-nitroaniline decreases by more than 20% when the molecule is coupled to a single-mode optical cavity with a coupling strength of $|\\lambda| = 0.05$ a.u. and when the cavity mode is polarized along the principal molecular axis. On the other hand, with this coupling strength and polarization, the isotropically averaged static dipole polarizability from QED-HF or QED-DFT decreases by only $\\approx$ 2--5%, depending on the choice of DFT functional.

This algorithm approximates a target nonunitary operator as a weighted sum of Hamiltonian evolutions, thereby emulating a dissipative problem by mixing various time scales. We introduce an efficient encoding of the LCHS into a quantum circuit based on a simple coordinate transformation that turns the dependence on the summation index into a trigonometric function. This significantly simplifies block-encoding of a dissipative problem and allows one to perform an exponential number of Hamiltonian simulations by a single Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) circuit. The resulting LCHS circuit has high success probability and scales logarithmically with the number of terms in the LCHS sum and linearly with time. We verify the quantum circuit and its scaling by simulating it on a digital emulator of fault-tolerant quantum computers and, as a test problem, solve the advection-diffusion equation. The proposed algorithm can be used for modeling a wide class of nonunitary initial-value problems including the Liouville equation and linear embeddings of nonlinear systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           We introduce an efficient method TTN-HEOM for exactly calculating the open quantum dynamics for driven quantum systems interacting with highly structured bosonic baths by combining the tree tensor network (TTN) decomposition scheme to the bexcitonic generalization of the numerically-exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system-bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac--Frenkel variational principle which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO, Tensor Equations for Non-Markovian Structured Open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: Two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics, and one adaptive-rank method with variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude--Lorentz component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable to simulate both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum system interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with affordable computational cost.

Leveraging the versatility of FLW, we introduce suspended waveguides and precisely engineered 2D and 3D microstructures, significantly enhancing thermal isolation and minimizing power dissipation. As a result, our processor operates efficiently at less than 10 W, requiring only a simple thermo-electric cooler for stable thermal management. The device exhibits exceptional performance after calibration, implementing Haar-random unitary transformations with an amplitude fidelity of 99.7 %.

    "abstract": "           We propose a new framework for identifying mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials without a closed-form constitutive equation. Given a full-field measurement of the displacement field, for instance as obtained from digital image correlation (DIC), a continuous approximation of the strain field is obtained by training a neural network that incorporates Fourier features to effectively capture sharp gradients in the data. A physics-based data-driven method built upon ordinary neural differential equations (NODEs) is employed to discover constitutive equations. The NODE framework can represent arbitrary materials while satisfying constraints in the theory of constitutive equations by default. To account for heterogeneity, a hyper-network is defined, where the input is the material coordinate system, and the output is the NODE-based constitutive equation. The parameters of the hyper-network are optimized by minimizing a multi-objective loss function that includes penalty terms for violations of the strong form of the equilibrium equations of elasticity and the associated Neumann boundary conditions. We showcase the framework with several numerical examples, including heterogeneity arising from variations in material parameters, spatial transitions from isotropy to anisotropy, material identification in the presence of noise, and, ultimately, application to experimental data. As the numerical results suggest, the proposed approach is robust and general in identifying the mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials with very few assumptions, making it a suitable alternative to classical inverse methods.

In this work, we discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. These resources can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\\Omega(\\log (t/\\epsilon))$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\\epsilon$, entanglement, magic, and coherence do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states by transforming $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit, $O(t [\\log t]^3 \\log n \\log(1/\\epsilon))$, is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in quantum information processing. As a concrete example, we propose classical shadow tomography using an estimator with superpositions between only two states, which improves the runtime of a state certification task by requiring only $O(1)$ measurements and queries.
