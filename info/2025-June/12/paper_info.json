Achieving efficient generation of such photon pairs with low-loss parametric oscillators is a key objective in advancing integrated quantum technologies. However, spatially separating the generated photons while preserving their entanglement represents a significant technical challenge. In this work, we demonstrate nonlinear generation of correlated optical harmonics based on non-degenerate four-wave mixing with an optimally pumped optical microcavity with Kerr nonlinearity. The phase matching of the process is achieved with self-injection locked lasers producing parametric oscillation while locked to two different modes of the microresonator. This condition is reminiscent of slow-light technique developed for coherent atomic systems. The experimental design, utilizing counterpropagating light from two self-injection locked lasers, also effectively addresses the challenge of spatial separation of the generated harmonics. We validate the theoretical predictions using two self-injection locked semiconductor lasers integrated with a crystalline whispering gallery mode resonator with optimized spectral structure.

    "abstract": "           Einstein Telescope (ET) is expected to achieve sensitivity improvements exceeding an order of magnitude compared to current gravitational-wave detectors. The rigorous characterization in optical birefringence of materials and coatings has become a critical task for next-generation detectors, especially since this birefringence is generally spatially non-uniform. A highly sensitive optical polarimeter has been developed at the Department of Physics and Earth Sciences of the University of Ferrara and INFN - Ferrara Section, Italy, aimed at performing two-dimensional birefringence mapping of substrates. In this paper we describe the design and working principle of the system and present results for crystalline silicon, a candidate material for substrates in the low-frequency (LF) interferometers of ET. We find that the birefringence is of order $10^{-7}$ for commercially available samples and is position dependent in the silicon (100)-oriented samples, with variations in both magnitude and axis orientation. We also measure the intrinsic birefringence of the (110) surface. Implications for the performance of gravitational-wave interferometers are discussed.         ",

For instance, the three-wave mixing process has been employed to great success for narrow-linewidth lasers, sensing applications, microscopy, and signal processing. While most of these avenues focus on room temperature operation, there is now increasing interest in cryogenic operation owing to the scattering mechanism's significant potential for applications and fundamental physics at low temperatures. Here, we measure the Brillouin scattering spectrum in standard single-mode telecommunications optical fiber at millikelvin temperatures using a closed-cycle dilution refrigerator and optical heterodyne detection. Our experiments are performed with a cryostat temperature from 50 mK to 27 K, extending previously reported measurements that utilized liquid helium-4 cryostats with temperatures greater than 1 K. At millikelvin temperatures, our experiment observes coherent acoustic interaction with microscopic defects of the amorphous material - two-level-systems (TLS) - which has not been previously observed in optical fiber. The measured behaviour of the linewidth with temperature is in agreement with well-established models of ultrasonic attenuation in amorphous materials comprising a background intrinsic scattering, thermally-activated scattering, and incoherent and coherent TLS interaction. This work provides a foundation for a wide range of applications and further research including sensing applications, new approaches to investigate TLS physics, and Brillouin-scattering-based quantum science and technology.

Here, we report a programmable free-space photonic architecture capable of implementing high-dimensional unitary transformations with translational symmetry. Information is encoded in structured light modes defined by circular polarisation and quantised transverse momenta, and processed using a cascade of three spatial light modulators interleaved with half-wave plates. We demonstrate the scalability and reconfigurability of this platform by simulating quantum walks for up to 30 time steps across one- and two-dimensional lattices, achieving unitary evolutions that distribute a single input mode over more than 7,000 output modes. The platform supports a wide variety of quantum walk dynamics, including time-dependent disorder, synthetic gauge fields, and electric-field-induced refocusing in 2D walks -- previously studied only in separate experimental settings. We further probe geometrical and topological features in chiral-symmetric processes by extracting bulk observables. Finally, using coincidence measurements from a time-tagging camera, we demonstrate compatibility with quantum optics protocols by reconstructing far-field distributions of heralded single photons. These results establish reconfigurable free-space photonics with structured media as a versatile tool for high-dimensional quantum simulations and scalable optical information processing.         ",

For typical laser pulses with picosecond duration, the momentum component of the optical force becomes of the same order of magnitude as the stress component, enhancing the overall optomechanical effects. Simulations of the optically-induced surface displacements in fused silica glass are also presented. With careful choice of realistic simulation parameters, dispersive and nonlinear effects were shown to be suppressed and displacements of 50 pm were found for single-pulse excitation with 100 fs duration, where the momentum component of the force is dominant. A possibility of measuring these displacements with piezo-electric detection is also discussed, providing a way to attain spatiotemporal characterization of the optical momentum force in continuum media. Such a description would significantly advance our current knowledge on the behavior of optical forces, potentially contributing to more versatile optomechanical applications, while also clarifying the ongoing Abraham-Minkowski fundamental problem on the momentum transferred by light.

The resulting THz electric field spans a frequency range from below 1 to above 30 THz. Our results suggest that the photocurrent is primarily driven by an ultrafast pyroelectric effect where the photo-excited carriers screen the spontaneous electric polarization of ZnSnN2. Strong structural disorder reduces the photocarrier lifetime significantly and, thus, enables broadband operation. ZnSnN2 shows similar THz-emitter performance as the best spintronic THz emitters regarding bandwidth and amplitude.

Here, we demonstrate the ability to measure and re-initialize, and if necessary replace, a subset of atoms while maintaining coherence in other atoms. This allows us to perform logical circuits that include single and two-qubit gates as well as repeated midcircuit measurement while compensating for atom loss. We highlight this capability by performing up to 41 rounds of syndrome extraction in a repetition code, and combine midcircuit measurement and atom replacement with real-time conditional branching to demonstrate heralded state preparation of a logically encoded Bell state.

Owing to the compact footprint of microring resonators (MRRs) and the enhanced interconnect efficiency enabled by wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), MRR-based photonic neural networks (PNNs) are particularly promising for large-scale integration. However, the scalability and energy efficiency of such systems are fundamentally limited by the MRR resonance wavelength variations induced by fabrication process variations (FPVs) and environmental fluctuations. Existing solutions use post-fabrication approaches or thermo-optic tuning, incurring high control power and additional process complexity. In this work, we introduce an online training and pruning method that addresses this challenge, adapting to FPV-induced and thermally induced shifts in MRR resonance wavelength. By incorporating a power-aware pruning term into the conventional loss function, our approach simultaneously optimizes the PNN accuracy and the total power consumption for MRR tuning. In proof-of-concept on-chip experiments on the Iris dataset, our system PNNs can adaptively train to maintain a 96% classification accuracy, while achieving a 44.7% reduction in tuning power via pruning. Additionally, our approach reduces the power consumption by orders-of-magnitude on larger datasets. By addressing chip-to-chip variation and minimizing power requirements, our approach significantly improves the scalability and energy efficiency of MRR-based integrated analog photonic processors, paving the way for large-scale PICs to enable versatile applications including neural networks, photonic switching, LiDAR, and radio-frequency beamforming.

Yet, they hold the promise to be efficient light emitters. Their high-throughput identification demands exceptionally accurate excited-state modeling to minimize qualitatively wrong predictions. We benchmark twelve S$_1$-T$_1$ energy gaps to find that the local-correlated versions of ADC(2) and CC2 excited state methods deliver excellent accuracy and speed for screening medium-sized molecules. Notably, we find that double-hybrid DFT approximations (e.g., B2GP-PLYP and PBE-QIDH) exhibit high mean absolute errors ($>100$ meV) despite very low standard deviations ($\\approx10$ meV). Exploring their parameter space reveals that a configuration with 75% exchange and 55% correlation, which reduces the mean absolute error to below 5 meV, but with an increased variance. Using this low-bias parameterization as an internal reference, we correct the systematic error while maintaining low variance, effectively combining the strengths of both low-bias and low-variance DFT parameterizations to enhance overall accuracy. Our findings suggest that low-variance DFT methods, often overlooked due to their high bias, can serve as reliable tools for predictive modeling in first-principles molecular design. The bias-correction data-fitting procedure can be applied to any general problem where two flavors of a method, one with low bias and another with low variance, have been identified a priori.

Using IBM Quantum back ends, we realize five imprint retrieval experiments that scale from a minimal three-qubit cell to a five-qubit dual cycle. For every circuit, we provide Wilson score 95 percent confidence intervals, Pearson correlations, and mutual information between field and output qubits, establishing unitary reversibility well beyond statistical noise for example, r Q0 Q2 equals 0.64 plus minus 0.04, p less than 10 to the power of minus 6 in the five qubit run. Taken together, the data constitute the most stringent experimental support to date for the QMM hypothesis: finite dimensional Planck scale cells can faithfully store, propagate, and return quantum information. Our results strengthen the standing of QMM as a viable, local, and unitary framework for addressing fundamental questions such as the black hole information paradox.         ",

    "abstract": "           The analysis of electromagnetic fields in cylindrical waveguiding structures that contain periodic ring loading, whether for applications in charged-particle accelerators or radiation transportation, has been traditionally conducted under simplifying limits, where the structure is either single-moded at the lower-frequency limit or overmoded at high-frequency limit. These limits have often allowed us to find spectral (modal) expansions for the fields under simpler analytical and computational conditions, with ohmic effects typically being the dominant power loss mechanism in the lower limit, while diffraction effects dominate the loss in the higher limit. In this Letter, we report the observation of a transition point in the character of the main loss mechanism, where ohmic loss becomes dominant in a structure typically presumed to be dominated by diffraction loss. The results follow a formal analysis for the scattered vector fields in a highly overmoded THz waveguide. The findings bridge between the traditional theoretical descriptions for the two limits and reveal key tradeoffs that inform experiments for the transportation of THz radiation over long distances.

We propose the QTF-Backbone: a dedicated national fibre-optic infrastructure in Germany for the networked distribution of quantum and T&F signals using dark fibres and specialized hardware. The QTF-Backbone is planned as a four-phase deployment over ten years to ensure scalable, sustainable access for research institutions and industry. The concept builds on successful demonstrations of high-TRL time and frequency distribution across Europe, including PTB-MPQ links in Germany, REFIMEVE in France, and the Italian LIFT network. The QTF-Backbone will enable transformative R&D, support a nationwide QTF ecosystem, and ensure the transition from innovation to deployment.

The promising applications of the valley degree of freedom include the next-generation valleytronic devices, quantum information processing, quantum computing, and optoelectronic devices. Graphene is an ideal quantum material for high-speed valleytronic applications because of its high carrier mobility and convenience of bandgap engineering. Employing first-principles density functional theoretical approach, this study opted bandgap engineering strategy via Germanium doping to open bandgap and enhance valley selectivity in graphene monolayers. The impact of Ge dopant concentration of 2%, 3.125%, 5.5%, and 12.5% is explored on the valleytronic; valley Hall effect, valley transport, and optical properties. The reported results demonstrate that bandgap, valley polarization, and second harmonic generation can be tuned effectively by varying doping concentration of Germanium. The Berry curvature profile is antisymmetric for corresponding K and K' valleys, thus leading to valley-dependent transport properties and a potential valley Hall effect. Finally, the second-order susceptibilities exhibit corresponding optical absorption peaks, indicating efficient second-harmonic generation due to the broken inversion symmetry. These findings highlight the potential of Ge-doped graphene for nonlinear optics and valleytronics applications, while providing novel insights into its topological phase and transport properties.

However, accurate neural representations of the ground state of interacting bosons on a lattice have remained elusive. We introduce a neural backflow Jastrow Ansatz, in which occupation factors are dressed with translationally equivariant many-body features generated by a deep neural network. We show that this neural quantum state is able to faithfully represent the ground state of the 2D Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian across all values of the interaction strength. We scale our simulations to lattices of dimension up to $20{\\times}20$ while achieving the best variational energies reported for this model.

Recently the quantum limits of active imaging have been explored with levitated nanoparticles, which experience a multimode radiation pressure backaction (the photon recoil force) due to radiative scattering of the probe field. Here we extend the analysis of multimode backaction to compliant surfaces, accessing a broad class of mechanical resonators and fruitful analogies to quantum imaging. As an example, we consider imaging of the flexural modes of a membrane by sorting the spatial modes of a laser reflected from its surface. We show that backaction in this setting can be understood to arise from spatiotemporal photon shot noise, an effect that cannot be observed in single-mode optomechanics. We also derive the imprecision-backaction product in the limit of purely spatial (intermodal) coupling, revealing it to be equivalent to the standard quantum limit for single-mode optomechanical coupling. Finally, we show that optomechanical correlations due to spatiotemporal backaction can give rise to two-mode entangled light, providing a mechanism for entangling desired pairs of spatial modes. In conjunction with high-Q nanomechanics, our findings point to new opportunities at the interface of quantum imaging and optomechanics, including sensors and networks enhanced by spatial mode entanglement.

We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data.

    "abstract": "           Microwave cavities used in axion haloscope experiments typically employ a tuning rod as a means to widen the range of resonance frequencies at which it is sensitive to axion-to-photon conversion. A realistic tuning mechanism requires a gap between the cavity end caps and the tuning rod to ensure movement, and causes some modes to hybridize with the resonant mode that is being tracked for the experiment. These so-called mode mixings lead to gaps in the frequency range that practically lose sensitivity to axions. In order to solve this problem, we present a cavity design which, for two tuning rod configurations corresponding to a lower and higher frequency range, have a dielectric rod inserted at a specific location that makes the cavity asymmetrical. Moving the tuning rod closer to the dielectric insert changes the location and frequency of the mode mixing compared to when it is farther away from it. This design is easily realizable in practical experiments and makes possible an axion dark matter search with minimal loss in sensitivity due to mode mixings. We also show that the same design has the same desired effect when cavity dimensions are scaled down to be smaller and are at higher resonance frequencies.         ",

In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\u00f6hlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. The evolution to the thermal state is characterized by an unusual entropy time dependence with an increase on short times and later significant decrease when approaching to the steady-state. This behavior is opposite to the Boltzmann H-theorem and is attributed to the formation of Rayleigh-Jeans condensate and presence of two integrals of motion, energy and norm. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity.
