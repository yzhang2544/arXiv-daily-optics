    "abstract": "           We present an educational approach aimed at introducing the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics (QM). By exploiting the formal analogy between sound wave behavior in an acoustic pipe (a drinking straw) and the quantum infinite square potential well, we provide an intuitive framework that explains the origin of energy quantization in bound quantum systems (such as atoms), introduces the concept of wave function (WF), and lays the groundwork for discussing the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. The proposed method enables low-cost experimental activities that actively involve students, facilitating a meaningful connection between theoretical principles and empirical observations. Moreover, it encourages critical reflection on the Copenhagen interpretation of the WF, promoting a deeper conceptual understanding.         ",

    "abstract": "           Monitoring urban air quality with high spatiotemporal resolution continues to pose significant challenges. We investigate the use of taxi fleets as mobile sensing platforms, analyzing over 100 million PM2.5 readings from more than 3,000 vehicles across six major U.S. cities during one year. Our findings show that taxis provide fine-grained, street-level air quality insights while ensuring city-wide coverage. We further explore urban air quality modeling using traffic congestion, built environment, and human mobility data to predict pollution variability. Our results highlight geography-specific seasonal patterns and demonstrate that models based solely on traffic and wind speeds effectively capture a city's pollution dynamics. This study establishes taxi fleets as a scalable, near-real-time air quality monitoring tool, offering new opportunities for environmental research and data-driven policymaking.         ",

    "abstract": "           III-nitride based full-color blue, green and red-light emitting diodes are critically important for a broad range of important applications. To date, however, green or red color III-nitride light emitters grown by conventional growth techniques are limited in efficiency compared to blue emitters. As opposed to metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), while grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE), the most intense emission is generally observed in the green spectral region in InGaN/GaN based light emitters. Such counterintuitive phenomenon of efficiency increase with increasing emission wavelength has been observed in both InGaN/GaN quantum-disks in nanowire and planar quantum-wells structures grown by PAMBE. Here, we experimentally show that the apparent absence of green gap in longer green wavelength is due to the difficulty of elimination of indium-rich non-radiative clusters and phase segregation in shorter blue wavelength quantum wells/disks.Excess indium due to the dissociation of the In-N bonds during growth lead to nitrogen vacancies and metallic inclusions. In radio-frequency PAMBE, the energy of the nitrogen radicals was found to be a driving force for indium this http URL detailed growth and associated photoluminescence studies suggests that uniform phase and absence of metallic inclusion is the underlying mechanism of efficient green InGaN/GaN quantum wells/disks grown with sufficiently energetic plasma flux. Our study is valid for achieving very efficient green and red color InGaN/GaN and breaking the green gap bottleneck in quantum wells/disks grown by state-of-the-art high-power plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy         ",

The instability of the entangled ion clock is below a clock operated with classically correlated states for all probe times. We observe instabilities below the theoretically expected quantum projection noise limit of two uncorrelated ions for interrogation times below 100 ms. The lowest fractional frequency instability of 7e-16 / sqrt(tau / 1 s) is reached for 250 ms probe time, limited by residual phase noise of the probe laser.

This work presents a highly efficient, low-noise quantum frequency conversion device for photons emitted by a silicon-vacancy (SiV) center in diamond to the telecom C-band. By using a two-stage difference-frequency mixing scheme SPDC noise is circumvented and Raman noise is minimized, resulting in a very low noise rate of $10.4 \\pm 0.7$ photons per second as well as an overall device efficiency of $35.6\\, \\%$.

Nano- and microstructuring of the diamond crystal is essential to enhance device performance, yet fabrication remains challenging and often involves trade-offs in surface quality, aspect ratio, device size, and uniformity. We tackle this hurdle with an approach producing millimeter-scale, thin (down to 70 nm) and highly parallel (< 0.35 nm/$\\mu$m}) membranes from single-crystal diamond. The membranes remain contamination-free and possess atomically smooth surfaces ($\\mathrm{R_q}$ < 200 pm) as required by state-of-the-art quantum applications. We demonstrate the benefits and versatility of our method by fabricating large fields of free-standing and homogeneous photonic nano- and microstructures. Leveraging a refined photolithography-based strategy, our method offers enhanced scalability and produces robust structures suitable for direct use, while remaining compatible with heterogeneous integration through pick-and-place transfer techniques.

    "abstract": "           We present a method to numerically evaluate functional integrals called integral decimation (ID). It constructs a separable decomposition of the integrand as a spectral tensor train (STT), a continuous generalization of the matrix product state. ID builds the STT by mapping the integrand to an auxiliary many-body wavefunction that evolves in time from an initially unentangled state. Each body-ordered term of the action corresponds to a quantum gate, applied to the state during its evolution. The gates generate entanglement, and decimation during the gate sequence compresses the integral, alleviating memory bottlenecks in high dimensional integration. In the application of ID to moment-generating and partition functions, the continuous nature of the STTs allows for analytical differentiation of the result. To demonstrate its versatility, we employ ID to calculate the partition function of a classical XY model and to solve a non-Markovian quantum relaxation problem. By circumventing the barren plateau problem that limited our earlier STT-based approaches to quantum relaxation [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 234111 (2024)], ID enables high-accuracy simulations of quantum dynamics in systems as large as a 40-site chain.         ",

While backpropagation has been fundamental to training conventional neural networks, its implementation in optical neural networks faces significant challenges due to the physical constraints of optical systems. We demonstrate how PSR, which calculates gradients by evaluating functions at shifted parameter values, can be effectively adapted for training UONNs constructed from Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes. The method leverages the inherent Fourier series nature of optical interference in these systems to compute exact analytical gradients directly from hardware measurements. This approach offers a promising alternative to traditional in silico training methods and circumvents the limitations of both finite difference approximations and all-optical backpropagation implementations. We present the theoretical framework and practical methodology for applying PSR to optimize phase parameters in optical neural networks, potentially advancing the development of efficient hardware-based training strategies for optical computing systems.

Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH simulations.         ",

We detect the critical point through non-local string order parameters and reveal its connection to the transition predicted between the Mott and Haldane insulators. Moreover, we demonstrate a striking property: stacking two identical systems eliminates the transition, confirming the predicted group structure and invertibility of SPTs. Finally, while introducing symmetry-breaking disorder also removes the transition, disorder averaging restores it. Consequently, the adjacent phases realize a form of mixed-state quantum order wherein the criticality between them depends on the observer's information.
