    "abstract": "           I revisit the Wigner (or Weyl-Wigner, WW) representation of the quantum electromagnetic field. I show that, assuming that Fock states are just mathematical concepts devoid of physical reality, WW suggests a realistic interpretation which turns out to be (classical) Maxwell theory with the assumption that there is a random radiation filling space, the vacuum field. I elucidate why, in sharp constrast, non-relativistic quantum mechanics of particles does not admit a realistic interpretation via WW. I interpret experiments involving entangled light beams within WW, in particular optical tests of Bell inequalities. I show that WW provides clues in order to construct local model for those experiments. I give arguments why Bell defintion of local realism is not general enough.         ",

    "abstract": "           The synergy between voltage waveform tailoring and structured electrodes is investigated in a radio-frequency (RF) atmospheric-pressure microplasma jet operated in helium with a 0.1% oxygen admixture. The device incorporates rectangular trenches in both electrodes and is driven by \"Peaks\" and \"Valleys\" waveforms synthesized from four harmonics (base frequency $f_{\\rm b} = 13.56$~MHz, $V_{\\rm pp} = 500$~V, $P=$1.2~W). Two-dimensional plasma fluid simulations, together with spatially and temporally resolved optical diagnostics (Phase-Resolved Optical Emission Spectroscopy and Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy), are used to demonstrate that the combination of asymmetric voltage waveforms with electrode structuring leads to strong spatial localization of electron power absorption and radical generation. This synergy results in a single pronounced maximum inside a trench at either the powered or grounded electrode, depending on the applied waveform, unlike a symmetric excitation, which produces a spatially symmetric enhancement at both electrodes. The effect is attributed to the interplay between waveform-induced sheath dynamics and geometric focusing provided by the trenches, enabling electrically reversible and selective enhancement of electron power absorption at a chosen location.

We demonstrate that, above a critical value of the pump intensity, a novel metastable electronic bound state is created, which can decay into the free electron continuum by two-photon ionization. We calculate the system's resonant fluorescence spectrum, finding results qualitatively different from the Mollow triplet expected in a bound-to-bound transition. The fluorescent emission can be used to measure the time-resolved population of the novel metastable state. Contrary to Kramers-Hennenberger atoms, stabilised by non-perturbative, non-resonant laser pulses, the physics we observe is inherently resonant and relies on perturbative level repulsion. In analogy to how the AC-Stark shift is a semiclassical version of the single-photon Rabi splitting observed in photonic cavity, the phenomenon we describe is better understood as a semiclassical version of recently observed excitons bound by a single cavity photon. Our results demonstrate a novel way to stabilise electronic states with intense laser fields, increasing our capability to design and engineer non-classical states of matter.         ",

Precise measurement of dispersion, particularly near the {\\Gamma}-point, is crucial since even subtle geometric deviations significantly impact the distribution of topological charges and associated polarization singularities. Here, we propose a novel technique to measure DS of PhC slabs with high angular accuracy of up to 3 x 10^(-4) radians, and spectral accuracy of 0.2 nm within an expanded region of the Brillouin zone. Remarkably, our technique is diffraction- and aberration-free as it does not rely on optical imaging but rather on spectral mapping. The analysis of DS presented in this work demonstrates the robustness of our technique, and enables us to distinguish anisotropic BICs along a specific symmetry axis from isotropic states around the {\\Gamma}-point. Moreover, the experimental DS obtained supply the information necessary to study and identify super-BICs.         ",

The modified electromagnetic environment offered by the WSe2 waveguide alters MoTe2 spontaneous emission, a phenomenon we directly image with our interferometric nano-photoluminescence technique. We captured spatially-oscillating nanoscale patterns prompted by spontaneous emission from MoTe2 into waveguide modes of WSe2 slabs. We quantify the resulting Purcell-enhanced emission rate within the framework of a waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) model, relating the MoTe2 spontaneous emission rate to the measured waveguide dispersion.

In this regime, the soliton solution is shown to be the sole available state for the intracavity field, allowing for the automatic excitation of single solitons without the application of any external perturbations or parameter ramping. The self-excitation of cavity soliton frequency combs is validated through numerical continuation of the Lugiato-Lefever equation, direct numerical integration, and experimental observation. We show that this regime of CS self-excitation requires only the cavity detuning and pump desynchronisation parameters to be set within the correct range, thus considerably simplifying the usually complex task of deterministic cavity soliton excitation. Additionally, we show that this procedure can also be extended to allow the deterministic generation of different families of multi-soliton bound-states. We believe this research offers a promising approach to considerably simplify cavity soliton generation in both macro- and micro- scale Kerr resonators, while also offering greatly increased thermal, power, and nonlinear efficiencies intrinsic to pulsed-driven systems.

Multi-layer metasurfaces (MLMs) further amplify this potential by intensifying light-matter interactions within individual meta-atoms at the nanoscale. However, maximizing nonlinear efficiency demands extreme field confinement through optimized designs of large geometric and material parameters, which exceed traditional simulation's computational ability. To overcome this, we introduce NanoPhotoNet-NL, an AI-driven design tool employing a hybrid deep neural network (DNN) that synergizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. This framework accelerates nonlinear MLM design speed by four orders of magnitude while maintaining over 98.3% prediction accuracy relative to physical simulators. The optimized MLMs achieve quality factors exceeding 50, enabling broadband third-harmonic generation (THG) in the deep ultraviolet (DUV) from wavelengths 200 nm to 260 nm via parametric sweeps. Furthermore, NanoPhotoNet-NL facilitates dynamically tunable DUV nanolight sources with 20 nm spectral coverage in the UVC band using low-loss nonlinear phase change materials.

    "abstract": "           The spatial and temporal evolutions of blue-core helicon discharge driven by a planar antenna with four concentric rings are explored on the Linear Experimental Advanced Device (LEAD). The discharge experiences distinct density jumps from E mode to H mode, W mode, and blue-core mode, when RF input power increases. This is similar to previous observations using other typical helicon antennas; however, this special antenna could drive modes of even higher levels for which the blue-core plasma column is actually hollow in radius, i.e. peaking off-axis, which was not presented before. The column shows counterclockwise rotation for blue-core mode and clockwise rotation for non-blue-core mode. The reason could be attributed to the radial electric field differenceses for both modes which reverses the rotation direction via ExB drive. Moreover, the centrifugal instability of blue-core helicon plasma is computed using a two-fluid flowing plasma model. It shows that the instability is strong for small axial wave number but becomes weak for large axial wave number. Perturbed density peaks at radius of 0.045 m, while the equilibrium density gradient peaks at radius of 0.055 m. The coincidence of their radial locations suggests that it is a resistive drift mode driven by density gradient. The blue-core mode weakens once the magnetic field or flow rate exceeds the threshold value. Increasing power further leads to a smoother plasma density gradient. The electron temperature profiles decrease with increased power, and the radial gradient of the electron temperature inside the core is smaller as the magnetic field changes. To our best knowledge, it is the first detailed characterization of blue-core helicon plasma driven by planar antenna, especially in terms of azimuthal rotation and centrifugal instability.

In an online experiment (n = 1,167 participants representative of the Dutch population), participants read a news article that included a metaphorical, non-metaphorical, or no explanation of a quantum phenomenon. Both explanation types reduced perceived comprehension of the news article compared to the control group, but increased actual comprehension of the quantum phenomenon. No direct effects were found on affect-based or cognition-based attitudes. Mediation analyses revealed a very small negative indirect effect of explanations on attitudes, through lower perceived comprehension, and a very small positive indirect effect of explanations on attitudes via increased actual comprehension - though the latter was counteracted by a negative direct effect. As metaphors offered no additional benefit over non-metaphorical explanations, the findings suggest they do not provide a communicative advantage for enhancing understanding or shaping attitudes in this context.

Yet, this means that different input states of polarization will result in very distinct behaviors, which may or may not be optimal in terms of sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. To tackle this challenge, this manuscript presents an optimization technique for the input polarization state using the Fisher information formalism, which allows for achieving maximal precision for a statistically unbiased metric. By first measuring the variation of the Mueller matrix of the optical fiber in response to controlled acoustic perturbations induced by piezo speakers, we compute the corresponding Fisher information operator. Using maximal information states of the Fisher information, it was possible to observe a significant improvement in the performance of the sensor, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio from 4.3 to 37.6 dB, attaining an almost flat response from 1.5 kHz up to 15 kHz. As a proof-of-concept for dynamic audio signal detection, a broadband acoustic signal was also reconstructed with significant gain, demonstrating the usefulness of the introduced formalism for high-precision sensing with polarimetric fiber sensors.

    "abstract": "           The mechanical behavior of any semiconductor microstructure is inevitably coupled to light. In the case of micro mechanical resonators (MEMs), carrier generation can affect the quality factor of the resonance through electron-phonon scattering and ohmic losses, but it may also inject energy into the structure and induce movement. Thus, semiconductor MEMs may be regarded as intrinsically optomechanical systems. Here, we report on the optical actuation of a simple-clamped n-GaAs cantilever. This is achieved through modulated nanowatt LED illumination at the resonance frequency. We propose that the mechanism responsible for the coupling between light and movement is piezoelectrically induced stress in the surface depletion layer. Motion may be detected using two methods: by measuring the piezoelectric voltage generated due to deformation or the current arising due to the capacitance changes. In the latter case, a bias voltage must be applied to the device, which leads to nonlinear dynamics. Our results indicate that photothermal and electrostatic effects can be ruled out because i) we measure a very small drift of the resonance frequency with the light modulation offset which, together with finite-element simulations, indicates photothermal effects are not responsible for actuation, ii) we observe a phase shift under different bias voltage polarities, which rules out electrostatic actuation and iii), static measurements performed using an optical profilometer confirm the piezoelectric nature of the interaction with light. In summary, we find homogeneous low power LED illumination to be an effective, simple and convenient method of actuation for piezoelectric semiconductor based MEMs.         ",

In dynamics with fast entanglement generation, quantum observables generally become insensitive to the details of the underlying dynamics at long times due to the effects of scrambling. In experimental systems, repeated time-reversal protocols have been successfully implemented to restore sensitivities of quantum observables. Using a 103-qubit superconducting quantum processor, we characterize ergodic dynamics using the second-order out-of-time-order correlators, OTOC$^{(2)}$. In contrast to dynamics without time reversal, OTOC$^{(2)}$ are observed to remain sensitive to the underlying dynamics at long time scales. Furthermore, by inserting Pauli operators during quantum evolution and randomizing the phases of Pauli strings in the Heisenberg picture, we observe substantial changes in OTOC$^{(2)}$ values. This indicates that OTOC$^{(2)}$ is dominated by constructive interference between Pauli strings that form large loops in configuration space. The observed interference mechanism endows OTOC$^{(2)}$ with a high degree of classical simulation complexity, which culminates in a set of large-scale OTOC$^{(2)}$ measurements exceeding the simulation capacity of known classical algorithms. Further supported by an example of Hamiltonian learning through OTOC$^{(2)}$, our results indicate a viable path to practical quantum advantage.         ",

We provide theoretical evidence that the number of coupled pseudomodes only needs to scale as $\\mathrm{polylog}(T/\\varepsilon)$ in the simulation time $T$ and precision $\\varepsilon$. Inspired by the realization problem in control theory, we also develop a robust numerical algorithm for constructing the coupled modes that avoids the non-convex optimization required by existing approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by computing population dynamics and absorption spectra for the spin-boson model. This work provides a significant theoretical and computational improvement to the coupled Lindblad framework, which impacts a broad range of applications from classical simulations of quantum impurity problems to quantum simulations on near-term quantum platforms.

This formulation allows the model to integrate both observational data and known physical laws to infer Hamiltonian parameters with greater accuracy and resource efficiency. We benchmark iPINN-HL against a deep-neural-network-based quantum state tomography method (denoted as DNN-HL) and demonstrate its effectiveness across several different scenarios, including one-dimensional spin chains, cross-resonance gate calibration, crosstalk identification, and real-time compensation to parameter drift. Our results show that iPINN-HL can approach the Heisenberg limit in certain settings and exhibits robustness to noises, while outperforming DNN-HL in accuracy and resource efficiency. Therefore, iPINN-HL is a powerful and flexible framework for quantum system characterization for practical tasks.         ",

To answer this question, we excited a GdFe ferrimagnetic alloy, the magnetization of which can be reversed by single laser pulses, a phenomenon known as toggle switching, by two pulses with a certain time delay in between. Using photoemission electron microscopy and Kerr microscopy for magnetic domain imaging, we explore the effects of varying fluences of the first and second pulse as well as the time delay between the two pulses. Our results show that when the fluence of the first pulse is adjusted just above the threshold of single-pulse switching, a second pulse with about 60% of the fluence of the first pulse, arriving only 3 ps later, switches the magnetization back. This reswitching persists up to about 40 ps pulse separation. We interpret the latter as the time required for the sample to cool down and remagnetize after the first pulse. For shorter time delays below about 2 ps, no re-switching occurs. However, the effect of the two pulses adds up, enabling switching for fluences of both pulses below the threshold for single-pulse switching. Atomistic spin dynamics simulations are used to model the experimental data, successfully confirming our results.         ",

However, the interpretation of the obtained data, in particular, distinguishing genuine ionic oscillations from the instantaneous electronic responses in THz Kerr effect remains challenging. Here, we combine two-dimensional Terahertz Kerr effect (2D-TKE) spectroscopy experiments and their modeling to unravel complex THz-induced temporal oscillations in twinned LaAlO$_3$ crystals at low temperatures. We identify the 1.1 THz mode as $E_g$ Raman phonon, while 0.86 THz and 0.36 THz signals are due to spurious effects resulting from the co- and counter-propagation of THz and optical probe pulses in birefringent twin domains. Furthermore, we determine that the $E_g$ mode is excited via a two-photon process, whereas THz pulse reflections at the sample surface produce a temporal response that can mimic anharmonic phonon coupling. Our findings highlight the importance of propagation effects in nonlinear THz experiments and provide a refined framework for interpreting THz polarization dynamics in birefringent crystals.

    "abstract": "           Recent progress in ultrafast optics facilitates the investigation of the dynamics of highly multimode quantum states of light, as demonstrated by the application of electro-optic sampling to quantum states of the electromagnetic field. Yet, the complete tomographic reconstruction of optical quantum states with prior unknown statistics and dynamics is still challenging, since state-of-the-art tomographic methods require the measurement of many orthogonal, distinguishable modes. Here, we propose a tomography scheme based on time-domain quadrature correlation measurements and theoretically demonstrate its ability to reconstruct highly multimode Gaussian states. In contrast to (eight-port) homodyne detection, the two local oscillator pulses are shorter in time and are (independently) time-delayed against the pulsed quantum state. The distinguishable mode structure is obtained in post-processing from the correlation measurement data by orthogonalization. We show that the number of reconstructable modes increases with the number of time delays used and decreases with the temporal extent of the local oscillator. We extend and optimise our proposed correlation measurement to electro-optic sampling by adding a nonlinear crystal prior to the homodyne detection, potentially achieving subcycle resolution in the mid-infrared to THz regime. By analysing the (quantum) correlations present in the measurement data, we show how thermalisation of the quantum state during detection leads to the requirement of correlation measurements. The thermalisation is especially pronounced in the strong squeezing limit, for which we developed a non-perturbative theory. Furthermore, we open an avenue to extending our tomography scheme to non-Gaussian states by theoretically establishing the complete measurement statistics and showing how to obtain spectral information about pulsed Fock states from the joint statistics.

Aiming at compact yet efficient formulations, a Lie group formulation was recently proposed, making use of body-fixed and hybrid representation of twists and wrenches. In this paper a formulation is introduced using the spatial representation. The second-order inverse dynamics algorithm is accompanied by a fourth-order forward and inverse kinematics algorithm. An advantage of all Lie group formulations is that they can be parameterized in terms of vectorial quantities that are readily available.

We show that towers of exact QMBS can be constructed by injecting a quasiparticle excitation that partially activates the frozen regions in the lattice. Meanwhile, the inelastic collision between multiple quasiparticles allows for the construction of approximate scars, whose damping is governed by an emergent two-body loss. Our findings establish direct connections between quantum many-body scarring and Hilbert space fragmentation, paving the way for systematically constructing exact and approximate QMBS.

However, limited attention has been paid to exploring the reverse mechanism in topological crystals. In this study, we propose that boundaries can serve as an alternative degree of freedom to manipulate topological bulk transports. We analytically and experimentally validate our concept using a finite-thickness photonic meta-crystal that supports bulk nodal lines, with its zeroth modes exhibiting opposite chiral bulk transports under different boundary conditions. Notably, the mirror symmetry remains preserved across both configurations. These findings are applicable to other topological systems, providing new insights into systems with varied boundary conditions and offering the potential for the design of more compact and spatially efficient topological photonic devices.

    "abstract": "           Neutral atom arrays and optical cavity QED systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science. While each platform has demonstrated exceptional capabilities-such as high-fidelity quantum logic in atom arrays, and strong light-matter coupling in cavities-their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement, building large-scale quantum networks, and engineering hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians. However, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity coupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including cavity-resolved readout into a fiber array as a proof-of-principle for future networking applications. This platform is species-agnostic and scalable, and we expect key metrics to further improve in a next-generation realization anticipated to be compatible with glass-cell-based experiments. Our work unlocks, for the first time, the regime of many-cavity QED, and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays.         ",

However, optical imaging and spectroscopy of atomic-scale structures remain a substantial challenge. Here, we developed ultralow tip oscillation amplitude s-SNOM (ULA-SNOM), where the ultra-confined field localized at a 1-nm-scale gap between a plasmonic tip and sample is combined with frequency-modulation (non-contact) AFM in a stable cryogenic ultrahigh vacuum environment. Using a silver tip under visible laser illumination with a constant 1-nm amplitude oscillation, we obtain a material-contrast image of silicon islands on a silver surface with 1-nm lateral resolution, which surpasses the conventional limits of s-SNOM.

For closely spaced multiple resonances/antiresonances, a definitive formula is given for the increase in fractional bandwidth enabled by Bode-Fano tuning. Methods are given for determining the conventional and complex-energy quality factors of antennas from RLC circuit models. New field-based quality factors Q(w) are derived for antennas with known fields produced by an input current. These Q(w) are remarkably robust because they equal Qz(w) when the input impedance is available. Like Qz(w), the field-based Q(w) is independent of the choice of origin of the antenna fields and is impervious to extra lengths of transmission lines and surplus reactances. These robust field-based quality factors are used to derive new lower bounds on the quality factors (upper bounds on the bandwidths) of spherical-mode antennas that improve upon the previous Chu/CR (Collin-Rothschild) lower bounds for spherical modes. A criterion for antenna supergain is found by combining the Harrington maximum gain formula with the recently derived formula for the reactive power boundaries of antennas. Maximum gain versus minimum quality factor for spherical antennas are determined using the improved lower bounds on quality factor for different values of electrical size ka. Lastly, reduced antenna quality factors allowed by dispersive tuning overcome the traditional Chu/CR lower bounds for lower radiation efficiencies and small enough bandwidth power drops.         ",

In electronic structure calculations on classical computers, resource reduction has been achieved by using the projector augmented-wave method (PAW) and plane wave basis sets. However, the PAW method generalized for many-body states introduces non-orthogonality effects which impede its direct application to quantum computing. In this work, we develop a unitary variant of the PAW (UPAW) that preserves the orthogonality constraints. We provide a linear-combination-of-unitaries decomposition of the UPAW Hamiltonian to enable ground state estimation using qubitized quantum phase estimation. Additionally, we further improve algorithmic efficiency by extending classical down-sampling techniques into the quantum setting. We then estimate quantum resources for crystalline solids to estimate the energy within chemical accuracy with respect to the full basis set limit, and also consider a supercell approach which is more suitable for calculations of defect states. We provide the quantum resources for energy estimation of a nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond which is a challenging system for classical algorithms and a quintessential problem in the studies of quantum point defects.

    "title": "Digital quantum simulation of squeezed states via enhanced bosonic encoding in a superconducting quantum processor",
    "abstract": "           We present a fully digital approach for simulating single-mode squeezed states on a superconducting quantum processor using an enhanced bosonic encoding strategy. By mapping up to 2^{n} photonic Fock states onto n qubits, our framework leverages Gray-code-based encodings to reduce gate overhead compared to conventional one-hot or binary mappings. We further optimize resource usage by restricting the simulation on Fock states with even number of photons only, effectively doubling the range of photon numbers that can be represented for a given number of qubits. To overcome noise and finite coherence in current hardware, we employ a variational quantum simulation protocol, which adapts shallow, parameterized circuits through iterative optimization. Implemented on the Zuchongzhi-2 superconducting platform, our method demonstrates squeezed-state dynamics across a parameter sweep from vacuum state preparation (r=0) to squeezing levels exceeding the Fock space truncation limit (r>1.63). Experimental results, corroborated by quantum state tomography and Wigner-function analysis, confirm high-fidelity state preparation and demonstrate the potential of Gray-code-inspired techniques for realizing continuous-variable physics on near-term, qubit-based quantum processors.
