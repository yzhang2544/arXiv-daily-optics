    "title": "Terahertz prototype for air pollutants detection",
    "abstract": "           In this work, we propose a prototype set-up exploiting terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) to investigate gaseous compounds. The system is portable and allows to perform remote measurements. We used the prototype to characterise for the first time in literature over a broad THz range, pure dichloromethane and chloroform, two pollutants known as very short-lived substances (VSLS) that strongly contribute to ozone depletion. The THz range allows selectively detecting their absorption lines related to the rotational molecular motion for which we also present the theoretical confirmation. Then, we investigate the optical response of a multi-component mixture achieved with the two aforementioned chlorine-based compounds mixed with two widely distributed volatile pollutants (acetone and methanol). For these first measurements, we developed the set-up specifically for laboratory condition in which the substances are directly injected into the gas-cell circuit. Finally, we modified the prototype to ensure that the ambient atmosphere is drawn directly into the gas cell via a long pipe and a suction system opportunely developed. The analysis of the mixtures in both laboratory and in-field conditions demonstrates that the prototype together with the approach employed in this work can simultaneously identify and quantify single components in the atmosphere. The results obtained open up new possibilities for the development and applications of an efficient portable THz-based sensor for the remote detection of multi-component environmental contaminants.

    "abstract": "           Optical frequency division (OFD) implements the conversion of ultra-stable optical frequencies into microwave frequencies through an optical frequency comb flywheel, generating microwave oscillators with record-low phase noise and time jitter. However, conventional OFD systems face significant trade-off between division complexity and noise suppression due to severe thermal noise and technical noise in the optical frequency references. Here, we address this challenge by generating common-cavity bi-color Brillouin lasers as the optical frequency references, which operate at the fundamental quantum noise limit with Schawlow-Townes linewidth on the 10 {\\mu}Hz level. Enabled by these ultra-coherent reference lasers, our OFD system uses a dramatically simplified comb divider with an unprecedented small division factor of 10, and successfully generates 10 GHz microwave signal with exceptional phase noise of -65 dBc/Hz at 1Hz, -151 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz, and -170 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz offset. Our work redefines the trade-off between noise suppression and division complexity in OFD, paving the way for compact, high-performance microwave synthesis for next-generation atomic clocks, quantum sensors, and low-noise radar systems.

    "abstract": "           This paper addresses the challenges of monitoring optical-fiber channels subject to complex, multidimensional impairments-such as dynamic interference across polarization or modal dimensions-where conventional methods suffer from high equipment costs, poor impairment discrimination and limited scalability. We propose an in-service, frequency-domain joint monitoring scheme based on constant-amplitude zero-autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequences. Exploiting their flat spectra and ideal autocorrelation, we model the channel as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system and estimate its frequency response to extract both differential group delay (DGD) and dimension-dependent loss (DL) regardless of dimensionality. Experimental validation in polarization-division-multiplexing (PDM) and mode-division-multiplexing (MDM) scenarios demonstrates robust performance: in a 2x2 PDM setup, polarization-dependent loss (PDL) error stays below 0.3 dB and polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) accuracy is 0.3 ps; in a 4x4 MDM system, mode-dependent loss (MDL) and differential mode-group delay (DMGD) errors remain around 0.3 dB and 0.3 ps, respectively. Fully compatible with existing coherent DSP without additional hardware, the scheme enables continuous, cost-effective, real-time monitoring of multidimensional optical channels.         ",

Vacuum laser acceleration with plasma mirrors injectors has garnered substantial research interest recently. However, a persistent challenge remains unresolved that electrons inevitably detach from the laser acceleration phase due to velocity mismatch. Here, we employ flying focus lasers to address this limitation. Through three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that flying focus lasers can achieve a substantial enhancement in relativistic electron charge yield compared to conventional Gaussian lasers. This improvement stems from two key attributes: (1) The subluminal propagation velocity of the peak intensity keeps a larger electron population synchronized within the longitudinal ponderomotive acceleration region, and (2) Flying focus lasers sustain higher magnitudes of the longitudinal ponderomotive force over longer distances in comparison to Gaussian lasers. This approach offers high-charge relativistic electron sources ideal for demanding applications such as high-flux Thomson scattering and radiography.         ",

However, these antennas suffer from low radiation efficiency and their theoretical directivity limit is 4.8 dBi. Magnetic dipoles with an electrical size larger than 0.5lambda are highly desirable for high-gain applications. This paper builds on the development of a magnetic dipole source that utilizes a 0.5lambda slot positioned near a printed dipole with a length twice that of the slot. Such a combination of electric and magnetic dipoles yields a highly directive radiation pattern, resulting in a higher gain than a uniformly illuminated antenna of similar size. The prototype is designed to operate at 4.5 GHz, with a directivity of up to 8.37 dBi. The analytical, numerical, and measured results agree fully. This high-gain superdirective antenna is highly desirable due to its excellent features, including being low-profile, PCB compatible, and having a low-complexity feeding topology, compared to the existing approach of the two-element end-fire array.

The amplified quantum state, prepared using a quadratic number of alternating unitaries, achieves a constant average-case measurement probability for globally optimal solutions across these problem sizes. This behaviour contrasts with that of classical heuristics, which, for NP-hard optimisation problems, typically exhibit solve probabilities that decay as problem size increases. Performance comparisons with two local-search heuristics on the same benchmark instances suggest that the non-variational QWOA may offer a meaningful advantage by scaling more favourably with problem size. These results provide supporting evidence for the potential of this quantum heuristic to achieve quantum advantage, though further work is needed to assess whether the observed performance scaling persists at larger problem sizes, and to confirm whether similar performance trends are observed for the other problem classes to which the non-variational QWOA is designed to generalise.

Here we demonstrate the design and application of a novel instrument that integrates scanning spectroscopic photocurrent measurements with structured light of controlled spin and orbital angular momentum. For structured photons with wavelengths between 500 nm to 700 nm, this instrument can perform spatially resolved photocurrent measurements of two-dimensional materials or thin crystals under magnetic fields up to $\\pm$ 14 Tesla, at temperatures from 300 K down to 3 K, with either spin angular momentum $\\pm \\hbar$ ororbital angular momentum $\\pm \\ell \\hbar$ (where $\\ell$=1,2,3... is the topological charge), and over a (35 $\\times$ 25) $\\mu m^2$ area with ~ 1 $\\mu m$ spatial resolution.

Brillouin lasers, known for their intrinsically narrow linewidths, present an appealing solution.

Additionally, most Brillouin lasers lack tunability. Lithium niobate (LN) emerges as an excellent platform for integrated photonics, offering large photoelastic coefficients and electro-optic tunability. In this work, we demonstrate strong optomechanical interactions in a 117-um-diameter LN microdisk resonator, achieved through post-fabrication dispersion management and enhanced mode matching enabled by the large off-diagonal elements of the photoelastic tensor. This approach yields an impressive optomechanical coupling rate of up to 30 kHz per photon, resulting in a tunable, integrated Brillouin microlaser with an intrinsic linewidth of 118 Hz and a low lasing threshold of 3.15 mW -- a remarkable performance for such a compact device. Furthermore, we demonstrate electro-optic tuning of the microlaser with an efficiency of 43.2 kHz/V, showcasing the versatility of LN for next-generation tunable photonic systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Optical injection locking of the repetition frequency of a quantum cascade laser frequency comb is demonstrated using an intensity modulated near-infrared light at 1.55 $\\mu$m illuminating the front facet of the laser. Compared to the traditional electrical modulation approach, the introduced technique presents benefits from several perspectives such as the availability of mature and high bandwidth equipment in the near-infrared, circumvent the need of dedicated electronic components for the quantum cascade laser, and allows a direct link between the near and mid-infrared for amplitude to frequency modulation. We show that this stabilization scheme, used with moderate near-infrared power of a few milliwatts, allows for a strong reduction of the frequency noise. We also perform a full characterization of the mechanism and evidence that the locking range follows Adler's law. A comparison of our results with those in recent literature indicates that the optical approach leads to better performance compared to the traditional method, which we expect to benefit mid-infrared spectroscopy and metrological applications.

    "title": "Ferromagnetic Traps for Quasi-Continuous Operation of Optical Nanofiber Interfaces",
    "abstract": "           A soft ferromagnetic foil uniformizes Tesla-level fields generated by attached permanent magnets, producing a smooth and electronically tunable surface field on the opposite side. By arranging n precisely fabricated rectangular foils, a nearly ideal magnetic quadrupole field with a substantial gradient can be created at center. This robust and rapidly tunable field configuration is well suited for two-dimensional magneto-optical trapping (2D-MOT) and magnetic guiding of cold atoms. By aligning an optical nanofiber (ONF) along the zero-field line of a planar 2D-MOT in a 2-foil assembly, we demonstrate quasi-continuous, field-free operation of the quantum optical interface without switching off the magnetic field. Transient transmission spectroscopy with nanosecond laser pulses is performed on the Rb-87 D2 line at a measurement repetition rate as high as 250 kHz. The observed line broadening, while not yet fully understood, is partially attributed to residual magnetic fields in the n=2 assembly. Through additional measurements and simulations, we verify that these residual fields can be fully eliminated in an n=4 assembly, resulting in an ultra-straight 2D trap that supports uniform light-atom interaction over exceptionally long, field-free distances. We extend our discussion to n=6, n=8 designs with similar uniformity but multiple zero-field lines. With its strong gradient for magnetic trapping, the ferromagnetic devices also enable new quantum optical scenarios featuring interactions between co-guided atoms and photons at ONF interfaces.

    "title": "Machine learning meets $\\mathfrak{su}(n)$ Lie algebra: Enhancing quantum dynamics learning with exact trace conservation",
    "abstract": "           Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising tool for simulating quantum dissipative dynamics. However, existing methods often struggle to enforce key physical constraints, such as trace conservation, when modeling reduced density matrices (RDMs). While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) aim to address these challenges, they frequently fail to achieve full physical consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the $\\mathfrak{su}(n)$ Lie algebra to represent RDMs as a combination of an identity matrix and $n^2 - 1$ Hermitian, traceless, and orthogonal basis operators,where $n$ is the system's dimension. By learning only the coefficients associated with this basis, our framework inherently ensures exact trace conservation, as the traceless nature of the basis restricts the trace contribution solely to the identity matrix. This eliminates the need for explicit trace-preserving penalty terms in the loss function, simplifying optimization and improving learning efficiency. We validate our approach on two benchmark quantum systems: the spin-boson model and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. By comparing the performance of four neural network (NN) architectures -- Purely Data-driven Physics-Uninformed Neural Networks (PUNN), $\\mathfrak{su}(n)$ Lie algebra-based PUNN ($\\mathfrak{su}(n)$-PUNN), traditional PINN, and $\\mathfrak{su}(n)$ Lie algebra-based PINN ($\\mathfrak{su}(n)$-PINN) -- we highlight the limitations of conventional methods and demonstrate the superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our approach in learning quantum dissipative dynamics.

The aim of this study is to extend the application of nonsymmorphic space groups in the field of numerical analysis for research and design of nanophotonics devices. In this work, we introduce the nonsymmorphic symmetry adapted finite element method, and provide a systematic approach for efficient band structure analysis of photonic structures with nonsymmorphic groups. We offer a formal and rigorous treatment by specifically deriving the boundary constraint conditions associated with the symmetry operations and their irreducible representations and decomposing the original problem into different subtasks. our method fully accounting for non-primitive translations and nonstructural symmetries like time-reversal symmetry and hidden symmetries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method via computing the band structure of photonic structures with a layer group, a plane group, and a space group. The results exhibit excellent agreement with those obtained using the standard finite element method, showcasing improved computational efficiency. Furthermore, the decomposition of the original problem facilitates band structure classification and analysis, enabling the identification of the different bands among the band structure in various subtasks. This advancement paves the way for innovative designs in nanophotonics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy is a powerful technique for extracting the low-frequency optical properties of materials. However, the optical constants are difficult to determine directly from the experimental transfer function, such that various numerical approximations must be implemented to describe specific conditions. Here, we introduce a modified Transfer Matrix Method that uses a genetic algorithm for optimization to determine the refractive index of materials in the THz regime. We show that this approach is generally applicable across a wide range of refractive indices, structures, and frequency ranges. Our method is intuitive and yields accurate results compared to leading methods across a wide spectral range (0.1 - 15 THz).         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum technologies present new opportunities for fundamental tests of nature. One potential application is to probe the interplay between quantum physics and general relativity - a field of physics with no empirical evidence yet. Here we show that quantum networks open a new window to test this interface. We demonstrate how photon mediated entanglement between atomic or atom-like systems can be used to probe time-dilation induced entanglement and interference modulation. Key are non-local measurements between clocks in a gravitational field, which can be achieved either through direct photon interference or by using auxiliary entanglement. The resulting observable depends on the interference between different proper times, and can only be explained if both quantum theory and general relativity are taken into account. The proposed protocol enables clock interferometry on km-scale separations and beyond. Our work thus shows a realistic experimental route for a first test of quantum theory on curved space-time, opening up new scientific opportunities for quantum networks.         ",

    "abstract": "           In the realm of computational science and engineering, constructing models that reflect real-world phenomena requires solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with different conditions. Recent advancements in neural operators, such as deep operator network (DeepONet), which learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, promise efficient computation of PDE solutions for a new condition in a single forward pass. However, classical DeepONet entails quadratic complexity concerning input dimensions during evaluation. Given the progress in quantum algorithms and hardware, here we propose to utilize quantum computing to accelerate DeepONet evaluations, yielding complexity that is linear in input dimensions. Our proposed quantum DeepONet integrates unary encoding and orthogonal quantum layers. We benchmark our quantum DeepONet using a variety of PDEs, including the antiderivative operator, advection equation, and Burgers' equation. We demonstrate the method's efficacy in both ideal and noisy conditions. Furthermore, we show that our quantum DeepONet can also be informed by physics, minimizing its reliance on extensive data collection. Quantum DeepONet will be particularly advantageous in applications in outer loop problems which require exploring parameter space and solving the corresponding PDEs, such as uncertainty quantification and optimal experimental design.

For this reason, it is important to understand which patterns of destructive quantum interference can occur inside the electronic excitation gap of a molecule, coupled to conducting electrodes. By considering a four-level model, we show that much more complex destructive quantum interference behavior can arise than expected for just two levels. We classify the destructive quantum interferences analytically and show that they may even occur in regions forbidden by the standard orbital rule for electron transport. Our results suggest that appropriate molecular design may indeed allow to construct highly sensitive molecular quantum rulers.         ",
