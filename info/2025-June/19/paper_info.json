In contrast to established methods such as the mercury capacitance-voltage technique, terahertz spectroscopy promises a contactless characterization. In this work, we simultaneously determine the charge carrier density of SiC epilayers and their substrates in a single measurement over a wide range of about 8x10^(15)$ cm^(-3) to 4x10^(18) cm^(-3) using time-domain spectroscopy in a reflection geometry. Furthermore, inhomogeneities in the samples are detected by mapping the determined charge carrier densities over the whole wafer. Additional theoretical calculations confirm these results and provide thickness-dependent information on the doping range of 4H-SiC, in which terahertz time-domain spectroscopy is capable of determining the charge carrier density.

Two theoretical methods are applied: Sagdeev pseudopotential analysis (SPA) and reductive perturbation theory (RPT). Since SPA incorporates all nonlinearities of the model it is the most accurate but deriving soliton profiles requires numerical integration of Poisson's equation. By contrast, RPT is a perturbation method which at second order yields the Gardner equation incorporating both the quadratic nonlinearity of the KdV equation with the cubic nonlinearity of the modified KdV equation. For consistency with the perturbation scheme the coefficient of the quadratic term needs to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the coefficient of the cubic term. Solving the Gardner equation yields an analytic expression of the soliton profile. Selecting an appropriate set of compositional parameters, the soliton solutions obtained from SPA and RPT are analyzed and compared.         ",

In this work, we add tunability to the 4H-SiCOI platform by integrating microheaters with compact microresonators. The strong thermo-optic effect in SiC enables a resonance tuning rate of $11.7$ pm/mW for a 36-$\\mu$m-radius SiC microring, with a maximum wavelength shift up to $2.4$ nm (300 GHz). The thermal time constant of the microheater is estimated near 7 $\\mu$s, corresponding to a 3-dB electrical bandwidth of 40 kHz. As a demonstration of potential applications, we employ the microheater to perform fast thermo-optic scans to deterministically access the single-soliton state of a 36-$\\mu$m-radius microcomb source. In addition, an add-drop filter based on an over-coupled 18-$\\mu$m-radius SiC microring is combined with the microcomb source for the selective filtering of individual comb lines, featuring an approximate 3-dB bandwidth of 5 GHz and an insertion loss of less than 1 dB. With such demonstrations, our work brings the much-needed tunability and reconfigurability to the 4H-SiCOI platform, paving the way for a wealth of chip-scale applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           The geometric spin Hall effect of light (GSHEL), which is associated with nonzero transverse angular momentum, has been demonstrated to occur without the need for light-matter interaction and is characterized by a transverse shift. Recently, there has been a surge in research on spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV) that carry pure transverse angular momentum. In this study, we examine the transverse shift of STOV in a tilted reference frame with respect to the optical axis. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we establish a linear relationship between this shift and the topological charge. Our findings reveal that only \"spatial STOV\" exhibits a GSHEL shift, this phenomenon is contingent upon the spatial distribution of their angular momentum density. When present, the shift direction is consistently perpendicular to the angular momentum vector, and its magnitude is found to be inversely proportional to the cosine of the tilt angle. We explore a maximum shift value, which is proportional to $\\sqrt{l{{x}_{0}}/{{k}_{0}}}$. These discoveries open up new avenues for the application in the realms of ultrafast optics and nanotechnology, offering a fresh perspective on the manipulation and measurement of light at the micro and nanoscales.

In this work, we report observation, as well as optical control, of fluorescence spatial hole burning effect in monolayer WS2. We demonstrate that the pronounced exciton-exciton annihilation process, in combination with the efficient capture of holes by intrinsic sulfur vacancy defects, induces significant photo-doping effect and eventually leads to fluorescence spatial hole burning. By means of a dual-beam pumping fluorescence imaging technique, we reveal that the recovery process of the spatial hole burning effect exhibits a double-exponential behavior. The fast recovery process originates from the release of trapped holes under the illumination of the probe beam, while the slow process corresponds to the re-adsorption of electronegative gas molecules. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that the electronegative sulfur vacancies can achieve ultralong-term storage of holes. Moreover, both the release and the rate of release of holes can be fully controlled by laser irradiation. These findings demonstrate the great potential of transition metal dichalcogenides in the development of optically-control excitonic devices.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are widely employed as ans\u00e4tze for solving variational problems, where their expressivity directly impacts performance. Yet, accurately characterizing QNN expressivity remains an open challenge, impeding the optimal design of quantum circuits. In this work, we introduce the effective rank, denoted as $\\kappa$, as a novel quantitative measure of expressivity. Specifically, $\\kappa$ captures the number of effectively independent parameters among all the variational parameters in a parameterized quantum circuit, thus reflecting the true degrees of freedom contributing to expressivity. Through a systematic analysis considering circuit architecture, input data distributions, and measurement protocols, we demonstrate that $\\kappa$ can saturate its theoretical upper bound, $d_n=4^n-1$, for an $n$-qubit system when each of the three factors is optimally expressive. This result provides a rigorous framework for assessing QNN expressivity and quantifying their functional capacity. Building on these theoretical insights, and motivated by the vast and highly structured nature of the circuit design space, we employ $\\kappa$ as a guiding metric for the automated design of highly expressive quantum circuit configurations. To this end, we develop a reinforcement learning framework featuring a self-attention transformer agent that autonomously explores and optimizes circuit architectures. By integrating theoretical characterization with practical optimization, our work establishes $\\kappa$ as a robust tool for quantifying QNN expressivity and demonstrates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in designing high-performance quantum circuits. This study paves the way for building more expressive QNN architectures, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of quantum machine learning.         ",

By proposing the use of a correlation energy functional and sampling of a polynomial set of excitation amplitudes of the quantum state, we can demonstrate an almost two order of magnitude reduction in required number of shots for a given statistical error in the energy estimate, as well as observing a linear scaling to accessible system sizes. Furthermore, we find a high-degree of noise resilience of these estimators on real quantum devices, with up to an order of magnitude increase in the tolerated noise compared to traditional techniques. While these approaches are expected to break down asymptotically, we find strong evidence that these large system arguments do not prevent algorithmic advantage from these simple protocols in many systems of interest. We further extend this to consider the extraction of beyond-energetic properties by mapping to a coupled cluster surrogate model, as well as a natural combination within a quantum embedding framework. This embedding framework avoids the unstable self-consistent requirements of previous approaches, enabling application of quantum solvers to realistic correlated materials science, where we demonstrate the volume-dependence of the spin gap of Nickel Oxide.

The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated.

    "abstract": "           Randomisation is widely used in quantum algorithms to reduce the number of quantum gates and ancillary qubits required. A range of randomised algorithms, including eigenstate property estimation by spectral filters, Hamiltonian simulation, and perturbative quantum simulation, though motivated and designed for different applications, share common features in the use of unitary decomposition and Hadamard-test-based implementation. In this work, we start by analysing the role of randomised linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) in quantum simulations, and present several quantum circuits that realise the randomised composite LCU. A caveat of randomisation, however, is that the resulting state cannot be deterministically prepared, which often takes an unphysical form $U \\rho V^\\dagger$ with unitaries $U$ and $V$. Therefore, randomised LCU algorithms are typically restricted to only estimating the expectation value of a single Pauli operator. To address this, we introduce a quantum instrument that can realise a non-completely-positive map, whose feature of frequent measurement and reset on the ancilla makes it particularly suitable in the fault-tolerant regime. We then show how to construct an unbiased estimator of the effective (unphysical) state $U \\rho V^\\dagger$ and its generalisation. Moreover, we demonstrate how to effectively realise the state prepared by applying an operator that admits a composite LCU form. Our results reveal a natural connection between randomised LCU algorithms and shadow tomography, thereby allowing simultaneous estimation of many observables efficiently. As a concrete example, we construct the estimators and present the simulation complexity for three use cases of randomised LCU in Hamiltonian simulation and eigenstate preparation tasks.         ",

    "title": "When do molecular polaritons behave like optical filters?",
    "abstract": "           This review outlines several linear optical effects featured by molecular polaritons arising in the collective strong light-matter coupling regime. Under weak laser irradiation and when the single-molecule light-matter coupling can be neglected (often in the limit when the number of molecules per photon mode is large), we show that the excited-state molecular dynamics under collective strong coupling can be exactly replicated without the cavity using a shaped (or ``filtered'') laser, whose field amplitude is enhanced by the cavity quality factor, shining on the bare molecules. As a consequence, the absorption within a cavity can be understood as the overlap between the polariton transmission and the bare molecular absorption, suggesting that polaritons act in part as optical filters. This framework demystifies and provides a straightforward explanation for a large class of experiments and theoretical models in molecular polaritonics, highlighting that the same effects can be achieved without the cavity with shaped laser pulses. With a few modifications, this simple conceptual picture can also be adapted to understand the incoherent nonlinear response of polaritonic systems. This review establishes a clear distinction between polaritonic phenomena that can be fully explained through classical linear optics and those that require a quantum electrodynamics approach. It also highlights the need to differentiate between effects that necessitate polaritons (i.e., hybrid light-matter states) and those that can occur in the weak coupling regime. We further discuss that certain quantum optical effects like fluorescence can be partially described as optical filtering, whereas some others like cavity-induced Raman scattering go beyond this. Further exploration in these areas is needed to uncover novel polaritonic phenomena beyond optical filtering.         ",

    "abstract": "           Acceleration of positive muons from thermal energy to $100~$keV has been demonstrated. Thermal muons were generated by resonant multi-photon ionization of muonium atoms emitted from a sheet of laser-ablated aerogel. The thermal muons were first electrostatically accelerated to $5.7~$keV, followed by further acceleration to 100 keV using a radio-frequency quadrupole. The transverse normalized emittance of the accelerated muons in the horizontal and vertical planes were $0.85 \\pm 0.25 ~\\rm{(stat.)}~^{+0.22}_{-0.13} ~\\rm{(syst.)}~\\pi~$mm$\\cdot$mrad and $0.32\\pm 0.03~\\rm{(stat.)} ^{+0.05}_{-0.02} ~\\rm{(syst.)}~\\pi~$mm$\\cdot$mrad, respectively. The measured emittance values demonstrated phase space reduction by a factor of $2.0\\times 10^2$ (horizontal) and $4.1\\times 10^2$ (vertical) allowing good acceleration efficiency. These results pave the way to realize the first-ever muon accelerator for a variety of applications in particle physics, material science, and other fields.         ",

    "abstract": "           Spintronic terahertz emitters pumped by femtosecond lasers offer an increasingly popular approach to generate broadband terahertz radiation. The strength of the emitted terahertz field is limited in part by the optical damage threshold at the pump wavelength of the spintronic terahertz emitter. Their thermal management can be improved by better understanding the electron temperature relaxation in the spintronic metal layer. Here we present a measurement of the electron temperature dynamics on a picosecond timescale using optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy. We observe that the optical pump induces a change in the terahertz transmission of the spintronic terahertz emitter. By measuring the resulting terahertz signal and employing a two-temperature model, we are able to calculate the dynamic electron temperature of the STE. This approach offers an advantage over other methods by avoiding additional heating of the sample by the probe pulse. This is especially significant for measurements of accumulative heat effects, which can dominate the optical damage mechanism when the spintronic terahertz emitter is pumped at a MHz repetition rate.

    "abstract": "           We introduce quantum J-oscillators that exploit intrinsic nuclear spin-spin (scalar J) couplings in molecules to produce phase-coherent oscillations. Operated in zero magnetic field and driven by a digital feedback, they operate from sub-hertz to a few tens of hertz frequencies. In a proof-of-principle experiment on [15N]-acetonitrile, the oscillator produced a 337 uHz linewidth over 3000 s, more than two orders narrower than in conventional zero-field NMR. This may facilitate precision measurements of J-coupling constants and allows distinguishing mixtures of molecules whose zero-field NMR spectra would otherwise be hard to separate. In addition, the combination of strongly coupled spin systems and programmable feedback turns the J-oscillator into a compact tabletop (and, eventually, chip-scale) platform for exploring nonlinear spin dynamics, including chaos, dynamical phase transitions, and perhaps time-crystal behavior. By uniting high-resolution spectroscopy and controllable quantum dynamics in a single, magnet-free setup, J-oscillators open new opportunities for applications where ultraprecise frequency references or molecular fingerprints are required.

    "abstract": "           Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \\times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.         ",

In recent years, QLGA has garnered attention from researchers thanks to its potential of efficiently modeling CFD processes by either reducing memory requirements or providing simultaneous representations of exponentially many LGA states. In this work, we introduce novel building blocks for QLGA algorithms that rely on computational basis state encodings. We address every step of the algorithm, from initial conditions to measurement, and provide detailed complexity analyses that account for all discretization choices of the system under simulation. We introduce multiple ways of instantiating initial conditions, efficient boundary condition implementations for novel geometrical patterns, a novel collision operator that models less restricted interactions than previous implementations, and quantum circuits that extract quantities of interest out of the quantum state. For each building block, we provide intuitive examples and open-source implementations of the underlying quantum circuits.         ",
