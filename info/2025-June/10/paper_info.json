    "abstract": "           Tritium, predominantly produced through spallation reactions caused by cosmic ray interactions, is a significant radioactive background for silicon-based rare event detection experiments, such as dark matter searches. We have investigated the feasibility of removing cosmogenic tritium from high-purity silicon intended for use in low-background experiments. We demonstrate that significant tritium removal is possible through diffusion by subjecting silicon to high-temperature (> 400C) baking. Using an analytical model for the de-trapping and diffusion of tritium in silicon, our measurements indicate that cosmogenic tritium diffusion constants are comparable to previous measurements of thermally-introduced tritium, with complete de-trapping and removal achievable above 750C. This approach has the potential to alleviate the stringent constraints of cosmic ray exposure prior to device fabrication and significantly reduce the cosmogenic tritium backgrounds of silicon-based detectors for next-generation rare event searches.

    "abstract": "           We theoretically investigate resonant x-ray scattering from two non-interacting Ne+ ions driven by an intense attosecond pulse using a non-relativistic, QED-based time-dependent framework. Our model includes Rabi oscillations, photoionization, Auger decay, and quantum interference among elastic scattering and resonance fluorescence pathways. We analyze how the total scattering signal depends on pulse intensity, atomic configuration, and initial electronic state. We find that the total resonant scattering yield exceeds its non-resonant counterpart; the angular dependence of the signal qualitatively resembles a two-atom structure factor; and the visibility of interference fringes is sensitive to pulse area and the initial electronic state. Only a subset of final states reached via resonance fluorescence exhibits interference, determined by the indistinguishability of photon emission pathways. Fringe visibility is maximized in the linear scattering regime, where ionization is minimal and resonance fluorescence pathways can be largely indistinguishable. These results highlight optimal conditions for applying ultrafast resonant x-ray scattering to single-particle imaging.         ",

    "abstract": "           Neural operators are capable of capturing nonlinear mappings between infinite-dimensional functional spaces, offering a data-driven approach to modeling complex functional relationships in classical density functional theory (cDFT). In this work, we evaluate the performance of several neural operator architectures in learning the functional relationships between the one-body density profile $\\rho(x)$, the one-body direct correlation function $c_1(x)$, and the external potential $V_{ext}(x)$ of inhomogeneous one-dimensional (1D) hard-rod fluids, using training data generated from analytical solutions of the underlying statistical-mechanical model. We compared their performance in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss in establishing the functional relationships as well as in predicting the excess free energy across two test sets: (1) a group test set generated via random cross-validation (CV) to assess interpolation capability, and (2) a newly constructed dataset for leave-one-group CV to evaluate extrapolation performance. Our results show that FNO achieves the most accurate predictions of the excess free energy, with the squared ReLU activation function outperforming other activation choices. Among the DeepONet variants, the Residual Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (RMSCNN) combined with a trainable Gaussian derivative kernel (GK-RMSCNN-DeepONet) demonstrates the best performance. Additionally, we applied the trained models to solve for the density profiles at various external potentials and compared the results with those obtained from the direct mapping $V_{ext} \\mapsto \\rho$ with neural operators, as well as with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) combined with Active Learning by Error Control (ALEC), which has shown strong performance in previous studies.

In contrast, tip-based measurement techniques offer sub-diffraction spatial resolution under ambient conditions, making them well-suited for nanoscale photothermal mapping. In this study, we employ tip-based optical force nanoscopy combined with phase-informed decomposition to investigate the origin of the photothermal force, enable nanoscale mapping, and evaluate temperature sensitivity. Our system achieves a temperature sensitivity of approximately 0.1 K without necessitating an additional temperature-sensitive layer.

In this work, we combine Kerr instability amplification with cross-polarized wave generation to simultaneously amplify and rotate the output polarization of a signal beam, and we explore laser and crystal parameters to control the resulting polarization. In 1~mm MgO(100), we amplify linearly polarized light by $2000\\times$ orthogonal to the pump and seed polarization. The parametric amplification and polarization rotation offers excellent pulse contrast enhancement for future high-power laser systems.

X-ray pinhole images showed that the cone effectively focused multi-spot laser light near its tip, enhancing local emission. While high-contrast laser irradiation reduced the fast electron slope temperature for flat targets, the use of a cone increased it by over threefold, corresponding to a fourfold rise in laser intensity. X-ray spectral analysis indicated an electron temperature of ~9~keV for the cone case, 17.5 times higher than that with a low-contrast laser. These findings demonstrate that combining high-contrast laser irradiation with cone-target geometry significantly improves laser energy coupling and plasma heating efficiency.         ",

The requirement for a moderate steepness of the probe suggests the presence of an uncertainty principle in the measurement of soliton eigenvalues, similar to the detection of microscopic particles. Our results can deepen the understanding of microscopic properties of solitons and their interaction mechanisms, and moreover provide a promising all-optical solution for the design of eigenvalue-based multiplexers and demultiplexers.

We validate the effectiveness of the extended method by computing the dipole-dipole time correlation function of the Holstein model relevant to the emission spectrum of molecular aggregates. Our results show that the method accurately captures static disorder effects using a one-shot quantum dynamical simulation, with only a moderate increase in MPS bond dimension, thereby significantly reducing computational cost. Moreover, it enables the generation of a much larger number of samples than the conventional direct sampling method at negligible additional cost, thus reducing statistical errors.

Through advanced numerical simulations, we demonstrate that HHG driven by spatio-spectral optical vortices produces far-field, extreme-ultraviolet STOV harmonics with non-scaling topological charge, i.e., with the same topological charge. This allows for the generation of attosecond STOVs, in contrast to previous works of HHG driven by STOVs, where the topological charge scales with the harmonic order. Our findings evidence that the scaling of the topological charge in HHG driven by spatio-temoral topological fields is not generally connected to that of the up-converted OAM.

    "abstract": "           The valley in the band structure of materials has gained a lot of attention recently. The promising applications of the valley degree of freedom include the next-generation valleytronic devices, quantum information processing, quantum computing, and optoelectronic devices. Graphene is an ideal quantum material for high-speed valleytronic applications because of its high carrier mobility and convenience of bandgap engineering. Employing first-principles density functional theoretical approach, this study opted bandgap engineering strategy via Germanium doping to open bandgap and enhance valley selectivity in graphene monolayers. The impact of Ge dopant concentration of 2%, 3.125%, 5.5%, and 12.5% is explored on the valleytronic; valley Hall effect, valley transport, and optical properties. The reported results demonstrate that bandgap, valley polarization, and second harmonic generation can be tuned effectively by varying doping concentration of Germanium. The Berry curvature profile is antisymmetric for corresponding K and K' valleys, thus leading to valley-dependent transport properties and a potential valley Hall effect. Finally, the second-order susceptibilities exhibit corresponding optical absorption peaks, indicating efficient second-harmonic generation due to the broken inversion symmetry. These findings highlight the potential of Ge-doped graphene for nonlinear optics and valleytronics applications, while providing novel insights into its topological phase and transport properties.

    "abstract": "           Modern Hopfield Neural Networks (HNNs), also known as Dense Associative Memories (DAMs), enhance the performance of simple recurrent neural networks by leveraging the nonlinearities in their energy functions. They have broad applications in combinatorial optimization, high-capacity memory storage, deep learning transformers, and correlated pattern recognition. Thus far, research on DAMs has been primarily theoretical, with implementations limited to CPUs and GPUs. In this work, for the first time to our knowledge, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a nonlinear optical Hopfield neural network (NOHNN) system for realizing DAMs using correlated patterns. Our NOHNN incorporates effective 2-body and 4-body interactions in its energy function. The inclusion of 4-body interaction scores a minimum ten-fold improvement in the number of uncorrelated patterns that can be stored and retrieved, significantly surpassing the traditional capacity limit for traditional HNNs. For correlated patterns, depending on their average correlation, up to 50 times more patterns can be stored compared to traditional HNNs. To test the system's robustness, the benchmark testing is performed on MNIST handwritten digit patterns. The results show a 5.5 times improvement in the pattern storage along with the retrieval of cleaner and less noisy patterns. These results highlight the potential of nonlinear optical DAMs for practical applications in challenging big-data optimization, computer vision and graph network tasks.         ",

    "abstract": "           We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\u00f6hlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. The evolution to the thermal state is characterized by an unusual entropy time dependence with an increase on short times and later significant decrease when approaching to the steady-state. This behavior is opposite to the Boltzmann H-theorem and is attributed to the formation of Rayleigh-Jeans condensate and presence of two integrals of motion, energy and norm. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity. System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.         ",

This study investigates an alternative approach: acoustic-driven surface cleaning using millimeter-sized bubbles excited at low, sub-cavitation frequencies. We identify and characterize a distinct translational resonance of these bubbles, occurring at significantly lower frequencies (e.g., 50 Hz for 1.3 mm diameter bubbles) than the Minnaert resonance for a bubble of the same size. Experiments reveal that at this translational resonance, stationary bubbles exhibit amplified lateral swaying, while bubbles sliding on an inclined surface display pronounced \"stop-and-go\" dynamics. The theoretical model treats the bubble as a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, where surface tension provides the restoring force and the inertia is dominated by the hydrodynamic added mass of the surrounding fluid. It accurately predicts the observed resonant frequency scaling with bubble size ($\\propto R_0^{-3/2}$). Cleaning efficacy, assessed using protein-based artificial soil on glass slides, was improved by approximately 90\\% when bubbles were driven at their translational resonant frequency compared to off-resonant frequencies or non-acoustic conditions. These findings demonstrate that leveraging translational resonance enhances bubble-induced shear and agitation, offering an effective and sustainable mechanism for surface cleaning.         ",

Using the third-order nonlinear differential equation from Kaveh Merat paper, we model the circuit and implement delayed feedback control to suppress chaos.

Then we explore two calibration techniques: Minimizing sum of squared errors (SSE), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with finite differences. Joint optimization of control parameters and the variable resistor achieves the best alignment with experimental data, accurately capturing phase and amplitude. SGD outperforms grid search in phase synchronization, though amplitude discrepancies persist due to model simplifications. The trade-off between accuracy and computational cost is analyzed, revealing scalability challenges in chaotic system calibration. Phase space analysis validates the model ability to replicate the chaotic attractor geometry, despite minor deviations. Overall, Stochastic Gradient Descent based calibration of chaotic nonlinear systems shows significant potential for advancing mathematical modeling and electrical engineering.         ",

The optical states are instead stored in the large Hilbert space of topologically protected and long-lived motional states (persistent currents) of the condensate, yielding a storage time three orders of magnitude better than presently available. Further, the use of a cavity provides orders of magnitude more resonances, and hence bandwidth, for reading and writing than internal atomic transitions. Finally, the analogy to cavity optomechanics suggests a natural path to wavelength conversion, OAM transduction, and nondestructive readout of the memory.         ",

In particular, achieving scalable, cost-effective, stable, high-rate, and high-purity single-photon emission at ambient conditions is paramount for free-space quantum communication. However, fulfilling all the requirements simultaneously under ambient conditions has remained a significant challenge. Here, the scalable, cost-effective ambient condition synthesis of nickel doped (Ni doped) CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (NPQDs) is presented using a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method. The resulting individual NPQDs demonstrate remarkable photostability, sustaining their performance for over 10 minutes under ambient conditions with environment humidity of ~55%, and exhibit exceptional single-photon purity (>99%) with a narrow emission linewidth (~70 meV). The remarkable photostability could be attributed to the spatial localization of exciton by Ni atoms on the surface of the nanocrystal, reducing its interaction with the environment. Our results demonstrated that NPQDs with outstanding combinations of quantum emitting properties can be both synthesized and operated at ambient conditions. These findings mark a significant step toward scalable, cost-effective quantum light sources for real-world applications, paving the way for robust quantum communication systems and devices.

Recently, we developed the Imager of MPPC-based Optical photoN counter from Yamagata (IMONY), an observation system utilizing a Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode (GAPD) as a sensor.

In this work, we present the first demonstration of both Stark tuning and charge state control of individual InAs/InP QDs operating within the telecom C-band.

At the same time, it is crucial to use a low photon dose to avoid altering the system, particularly when dealing with biological samples. Quantum imaging offers a powerful approach for extracting more information per photon than classical techniques, which are ultimately limited by shot-noise. However, the trade-off between quantum noise reduction and spatial resolution has been considered a major drawback to the application of quantum techniques to small cellular and sub-cellular structures, where they could offer the most significant benefits. In this work, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating a resolution-independent quantum advantage. We achieve high-resolution phase imaging limited only by the numerical aperture, while simultaneously attaining quantum noise reduction. This enables, for the first time, sub-shot-noise quantitative phase imaging of biological cells. Unlike other quantum imaging approaches, our method operates in a quasi-single-shot wide-field mode, retrieves both phase and amplitude information, and does not rely on interferometric measurements, making it intrinsically fast and stable.

    "abstract": "           Over the past few decades, optical manipulation has emerged as a highly successful tool in various fields, such as biology, micro/nanorobotics, and physics. Among the different techniques, the transverse slot optical waveguide has shown remarkable potential in enhancing the field and significantly improving optical trapping capabilities. Additionally, microring resonators have demonstrated the ability to enhance the field at specific resonance wavelengths, enabling the manipulation and capture of particles. In this study, we investigated the impact of the structure on nanoparticle capture by introducing a 50 nm transverse slot in a 5 {\\mu}m microring resonator. Through the integration of a transverse slot in the microring resonator, we observed a substantial increase in the maximum bound optical power for a nanosphere with a refractive index of 1.6 and a diameter of 50 nm, reaching 3988.8 pN/W. This value is 2292 times higher than the maximum optical force in a straight waveguide and 2.266 times higher than the maximum optical force in a microring resonator. The proposed structure significantly enhances the optical trapping capabilities for nanoscale particles, thus paving the way for the development of advanced micro/nanomanipulation techniques.

    "abstract": "           Wearable on-body millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars can provide obstacle detection and guidance for visually impaired individuals. The antennas, being a crucial component of these systems, must be lightweight, flexible, low-cost, and compact. However, existing antennas suffer from a rigid form factor and limited reconfigurability. This article presents a low-profile, fast scanning leaky-wave antenna (LWA) operating in the unlicensed V-band (57-64 GHz) for on-body applications such as lightweight portable frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars. The novel meandering microstrip design allows independent control of gain and scanning rate (rate of change of main beam pointing direction with frequency). Experimental results show that the LWA achieves a realized gain above 10 dB with a fan-beam steering range in the H-plane from -35{deg} to 45{deg} over the operating frequency band, while the half power beamwidth (HPBW) is within 20{deg} in planar condition. To assess the on-body applicability, the antenna's performance is evaluated under bending. When placed on the knee (corresponding to 80 mm radius), the beam steers from -25{deg} to 55{deg} with a maximum realized gain degradation of 1.75 dB, and an increase of HPBW up to 25{deg}. This demonstrates the LWA's robustness in conformal conditions, while maintaining beam-forming and beam-scanning capabilities. Simulations confirm that the LWA's ground plane minimizes user exposure, adhering to international guidelines. Finally, we demonstrate a 2-D spatial scanning by employing an array of twelve LWAs with phased excitation, enabling beam-forming in the E-plane from -50{deg} to 50{deg}, while the HPBW remains below 20{deg}. Mutual coupling analysis reveals that isolation loss and active reflection coefficient remain below 15 dB throughout the operating band.         ",

The embedded element patterns are subject to the optimization with two distinct goals under study: focusing the radiation in a single direction or synthesizing patterns with desired shapes. The reactive terminations of passive antenna elements serve as optimization variables. We demonstrate the framework using a connected bowtie-slot antenna and antenna array with both beam-focusing and beam-shaping targets. The tests show that the optimization on the Riemannian manifold yields superior results compared to existing methods, such as the genetic algorithm.

We use a combination of numerical calculations for a system where strong correlation effects dominate, and conclusions drawn from our preliminary scaling analysis for QAE and VQE to make the case for QAE as a NISQ era contender to VQE for quantum chemistry. For the former, we pick the representative example of computing avoided crossings in the H4 molecule in a rectangular geometry, and demonstrate that we obtain results to within about 1.2% of the full configuration interaction value on the D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Following our numerical results, we carry out a detailed yet preliminary analysis of the scaling behaviours of both the QAE and the VQE algorithms to assess the competency of the former for NISQ era chemistry.

Here, we repurpose optical resonances in polymer spheres to transform microplastic particles into microscopic lasers. These laser particles emit distinctive and stable spectral signatures that are used as optical barcodes and thus enable in vivo tracking of microplastics in optically opaque coral fragments. Simultaneously, they provide a platform for real-time sensing of dynamic changes at the microplastic surface with nanoscale resolution, shedding light on the internalization and transport of individual microplastic particles in live corals, e.g. as part of the complex marine food web.

    "abstract": "           Silicon photonic devices fundamental to high-density wavelength-division multiplexed (DWDM) optical links and photonic switching networks, such as resonant modulators and Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), are highly sensitive to fabrication variations and operational temperature swings. However, thermal tuning to compensate for fabrication and operational temperature variations can result in prohibitive power consumption, challenging the scalability of energy-efficient photonic integrated circuits (PICs). In this work, we develop and demonstrate a wafer-scale thermal undercut process in a 300 mm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundry that dramatically improves the thermal isolation of thermo-optic devices by selectively removing substrate material beneath the waveguides and resonators. This approach significantly reduces the power required for thermal tuning across multiple device architectures, achieving almost a 5$\\times$ improvement in tuning efficiency in a state-of-the-art 4.5 $\\mu$m radius microdisk modulator and a 40$\\times$ improvement in efficiency for a MZI phase shifter. To the best of the authors' knowledge, we demonstrate the first wafer-scale comparison of non-undercut and undercut silicon photonic devices using comprehensive wafer-scale measurements across 64 reticles of a 300 mm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. Further, we demonstrate a comprehensive wafer-scale analysis of the influence of undercut trench opening geometry on device tuning efficiency. Notably, we observe highly uniform performance across the full 300 mm wafer for multiple device types, emphasizing that our process can be scaled to large-scale photonic circuits with high yield. These results open new opportunities for large-scale integrated photonic circuits using thermo-optic devices, paving the way for scalable, low-power silicon photonic systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Stoichiometric silicon nitride has emerged as a widely used integrated photonic material owing to its high index of refraction, nonlinear optical properties, and broad transparency window spanning visible to mid-IR frequencies. However, silicon nitride is generally more resistant to reactive ion etching than are typical etch masks made of polymer-based resist. This necessitates resist layers that are significantly thicker than the silicon nitride and results in mask patterns which are tall and narrow. These high-aspect-ratio patterns inhibit the plasma transport of reactive ion etching, which leads to difficulties in accurately reproducing dimensions and creating well-defined, vertical waveguide sidewalls. In this work, we overcome these challenges by developing a metallic etch mask deposited via metal lift-off that provides a 30 : 1 nitride-to-metal etch rate ratio, representing a near 45-fold reduction in the required mask thickness. We demonstrate the validity of this technique by etching microring resonators with near-vertical waveguide sidewalls and intrinsic quality factors of over 1 million. Leveraging the low optical loss of our resonators, we generate optical frequency combs with more than an octave of bandwidth and dual dispersive waves. These results establish metal lift-off as a viable and easy-to-implement technique capable of producing low optical loss waveguides.         ",

Recently, crystalline silicon has been demonstrated to be an appealing alternative plasmonic material, both for the infrared where free-carrier plasmons are enabled by heavy doping, and for the ultraviolet where plasmonic effects are induced by interband transitions. Herein, we demonstrate that nanostructured amorphous silicon exhibits such so-called interband plasmonic properties in the ultraviolet, as opposed to the expectation that they would only arise in crystalline materials. We report optical plasmon resonances in the 100-to-300 nm wavelength range in ultrathin nanostructures. These resonances shift spectrally with the nanostructure shape and the nature of the surrounding matrix, while their field enhancement properties turn from epsilon-near-zero plasmonic to surface plasmonic. We present a vacuum ultraviolet wavelength- and polarization-selective ultrathin film absorber design based on deeply-subwavelength anisotropically-shaped nanostructures. These findings reveal amorphous silicon as a promising material platform for ultracompact and room-temperature-processed ultraviolet plasmonic devices operating down to vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths, for applications including anticounterfeiting, data encryption and storage, sensing and detection. Furthermore, these findings raise a fundamental question on how plasmonics can be based on amorphous nanostructures.         ",

Unfolding is viewed as a procedure for estimating an unknown probability density function. Both external and internal quality assessment methods can be applied for this purpose. In some cases, external criteria exist to evaluate deconvolution quality. A typical example is the deconvolution of a blurred image, where the sharpness of the restored image serves as an indicator of quality. However, defining such external criteria can be challenging, particularly when a measurement has not been performed previously. In such instances, internal criteria are necessary to assess the quality of the result independently of external information. The article discusses two internal criteria: MISE for the unfolded distribution and the condition number of the correlation matrix of the unfolded distribution. These internal quality criteria are applied to a comparative analysis of the two methods using identical numerical data. The results of the analysis demonstrate the superiority of the Data Unfolding method with MISE optimization over the Richardson-Lucy method.         ",

Despite their advantages in radiation tolerance, 3D pixel sensors exhibit non-uniform electric and weighting fields that can degrade timing performance. This study explores the impact of pixel cell geometry on the timing characteristics of 3D columnar-electrode sensors fabricated by IMB-CNM, comparing square and hexagonal layouts. The sensors were characterized using the Two-Photon Absorption Transient Current Technique (TPA-TCT), providing high-resolution three-dimensional maps of the Time-of-Arrival (ToA) of charge carriers. Measurements at multiple depths and bias voltages reveal that the square geometry yields a more uniform temporal response compared to the hexagonal configuration. Additionally, a novel TPA-TCT-based method was introduced to determine the sensor jitter, relying on the analysis of the time difference between consecutive pulses in the TPA-TCT pulse train acquired under identical conditions. These findings underline the importance of pixel design optimization for future 4D-tracking detectors and confirm the TPA-TCT method as a powerful tool for detailed timing characterization.

The two issues are strictly related, since only upon reliable convergence, the simulated dynamics is able to capture the large amplitude motion associated to the torsion around the reactive bond, typical of photoisomerizations, which is due to the large amount of kinetic energy acquired by the vibrational modes after light excitation.

We demonstrate a cryogenic OLC that utilizes a dynamically actuated radiation shield to control the perturbation at $1.7\\times10^{-20}$ fractional frequency, a factor of $\\sim$40 beyond the best OLC to date. Our shield furnishes the atoms with a near-ideal cryogenic blackbody radiation (BBR) environment by rejecting external thermal radiation at the part-per-million level during clock spectroscopy, overcoming a key limitation with previous cryogenic BBR control solutions in OLCs. While the lowest BBR shift uncertainty is realized with cryogenic operation, we further exploit the radiation control that the shield offers over a wide range of temperatures to directly measure and verify the leading BBR Stark dynamic correction coefficient for ytterbium. This independent measurement reduces the literature-combined uncertainty of this coefficient by 30%, thus benefiting state-of-the-art Yb OLCs operated at room temperature.

For example, autonomy could pare down the classical control wires that heat and decohere quantum circuits; and an autonomous quantum refrigerator recently reset a superconducting qubit to near its ground state, as is necessary before a computation. Which fundamental conditions are necessary for realizing useful autonomous quantum machines? Inspired by recent quantum thermodynamics and chemistry, we posit conditions analogous to DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing. Furthermore, we illustrate the criteria with multiple autonomous quantum machines (refrigerators, circuits, clocks, etc.) and multiple candidate platforms (neutral atoms, molecules, superconducting qubits, etc.). Our criteria are intended to foment and guide the development of useful autonomous quantum machines.         ",

These oscillations arise from quantum beats between two size-quantized states of the condensate, split in energy due to the trap's ellipticity. By precisely targeting specific spots inside the trap with nonresonant laser pulses, we control frequency, amplitude, and phase of these quantum beats. The condensate wave function dynamics is visualized on a streak camera and mapped to the Bloch sphere, demonstrating Hadamard and Pauli-Z operations. We conclude that a qubit based on a superposition of these two polariton states would exhibit a coherence time exceeding the lifetime of an individual exciton-polariton by at least two orders of magnitude.

    "title": "Review: Quantum Metrology and Sensing with Many-Body Systems",
    "abstract": "           The main power of quantum sensors is achieved when the probe is composed of several particles. In this situation, quantum features such as entanglement contribute to enhancing the precision of quantum sensors beyond the capacity of classical sensors. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for non-interacting particles that are prepared in a special form of maximally entangled states. These probes are extremely sensitive to decoherence, and any interaction between particles is detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in both scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first-order, second-order, topological, and localization phase transitions, have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum-enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity: the energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time is another parameter that can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In general, a more complete understanding of resources for non-equilibrium quantum sensors is now rapidly evolving. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in quantum metrology and sensing using many-body systems.         ",

We show that, if the universal quantum state is a typical unit vector from a high-dimensional subspace H_0 of Hilbert space H (such as the one defined by a low-entropy macro-state as prescribed by the Past Hypothesis), then no observation can determine or just significantly narrow down which vector it is. In other words, the overwhelming majority of possible state vectors are observationally indistinguishable from each other (and from the density matrix of H_0). Moreover, we show that for any observation that isn't too unlikely and most pairs of unit vectors from H_0, the observation will not significantly favor one vector over the other. We further show that the uniform distribution over the unit sphere in H_0, after Bayesian updating in the light of any observation that isn't too unlikely, is still extremely close to uniform. Our arguments rely on a typicality theorem from quantum statistical mechanics. We also discuss how theoretical considerations beyond empirical evidence might inform our understanding of this fact and our knowledge of the universal quantum state.         ",

    "abstract": "           In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state energy for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ & $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.         ",

In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on static refractiveindex profiles or metamaterials, here the PSHE is controlled via a nonlocal third-order nonlinear susceptibility arising from long range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. We show that this nonlocal nonlinearity enables dynamic modulation of spin-dependent light trajectories, amplifying the normally weak PSHE into a readily observable and adjustable effect. These results pave the way for new capabilities in photonic information processing and sensing. In particular, an adjustable PSHE may enable beam steering based on photon spin, improve the sensitivity of precision measurements, and support photonic devices whose functionality can be reconfigured in real time.

    "abstract": "           Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern\" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.         ",

When planets form in the gaseous disk, the gravitational interaction with the disk gas drives their migration and results in the trapping of neighboring planets in mean motion resonances, though these resonances can later be broken when the damping effects of disk gas or planetesimals wane. It is widely accepted that the outer Solar System gas giant planets originally formed in a resonant chain, which was later disrupted by dynamical instabilities. Here, we explore whether the early formation of the terrestrial planets in a resonance chain (including Theia) can evolve to the present configuration. Using N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the giant planet instability would also have destabilized the terrestrial resonance chain, triggering moon-forming giant impacts in 20--50\\% of our simulated systems, dependent on the initial resonance architecture. After the instability, the eccentricity and inclination of the simulated planets match their present-day values. Under the proposed scenario, the current period ratio of 3.05 between Mars and Venus -- devoid of any special significance in traditional late formation models -- naturally arises as a relic of the former resonance chain.
