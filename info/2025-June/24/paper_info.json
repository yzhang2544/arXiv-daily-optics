    "abstract": "           Identification and subsequent manipulation of resonant modes typically relies on comparison with calculations which require precise knowledge of material parameters and dimensions. For millimetre-sized resonators that support millimetre-wave modes, this is particularly challenging due to the poorly determined physical parameters and additional perturbative effects of nearby dielectric or metallic substrates in experimental setups. Here, we use perturbation from a metal needle to experimentally map the spatial distribution of terahertz modes in a silicon disc resonator. We then use this information to design a patterned structure to manipulate specific modes in the system, a technique that could be useful for targeted tuning of such modes.         ",

Our scheme enables the system to collapse toward the eigenstate of an effective linear Hamiltonian with the eigenvalue of largest imaginary part, serving as a fixed-point attractor. In dimer systems, we identify exceptional points that separate oscillatory and convergent regimes, allowing controllable switching between mode collapsing and Rabi-type oscillation. By modulating the gain-loss profile over time, we achieve programmable transitions between eigenmodes, with strategically introduced symmetry-breaking perturbations accelerating convergence. Full-wave simulations validate our approach and highlight its potential for acoustic switching, signal processing, and analog computation.

The metasurface consists of two resonators of different sizes, representing effective gain and loss elements, placed orthogonally in close proximity to realize a non-Hermitian configuration leading to a PT symmetry state. A diagonal displacement of one resonator within this strongly coupled near-field configuration leads to the emergence of an exceptional point, where the system undergoes a sudden phase transition from a PT symmetric to a PT-asymmetric state. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is performed on the fabricated samples to experimentally validate the phase transition observed in numerical simulations. We employ coupled mode theory (CMT) to analyse and distinguish between the PT-symmetric, exceptional point, and PT-asymmetric states. This theoretical framework enables the calculation of eigenvalues, phase spectra, and eigenmodes associated with the metamaterial design, thereby corroborating the simulation results. Furthermore, we construct Poincare sphere to visualize the orientation of the polarization states of the eigenmodes, which further indicates the presence of the exceptional point. This comprehensive study of exceptional point in a plasmonic system holds potential for the development of practical, highly sensitive terahertz devices, addressing limitations of conventional PT-symmetric systems that rely on traditional gain and loss media.

Utilizing BP's intrinsic linear dichroism in a metasurface cavity, the SOM achieves sub-nanotesla precision and vector magnetic field sensing. BP enhances light-matter interactions, enabling tunable optical responses driven by Lorentz force-induced cavity deformation. Optimized metasurface unit cells increase polarization-dependent absorption, improving detection sensitivity. Finite Element Method simulations show high linearity (R-squared > 0.999), tunable dynamic range, and adjustable sensitivity via current modulation. At 200 microamps, the SOM reaches a sensitivity of 31.25 picotesla, while lower currents expand the dynamic range up to +-10 nanotesla. This tunability allows for application-specific optimization in areas such as biomagnetic sensing, metrology, and industrial field detection. Unlike SQUIDs and optically pumped magnetometers, the BP-based SOM operates at room temperature and nanoscale dimensions with comparable sensitivity, eliminating the need for cryogenics or vapor cells. Power consumption remains under 1 microwatt, far below conventional technologies.

Laboratory experiments and real-world natatorium measurements demonstrate the model's efficacy in capturing complex temporal and spatial scattering behaviors, offering vital insights and robust predictive capabilities essential for deploying possible THz communication systems in aquatic and sports environments.

    "abstract": "           Plasma-based optics have emerged as a powerful platform for manipulating and amplifying ultra-intense laser pulses. However, the inherently nonlinear and dynamic nature of plasma leads to significant spatial, spectral, and temporal modulations when driven at relativistic intensities. These modifications can dramatically alter the structure of the reflected laser pulses, posing challenges for their use in applications such as vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and X-ray generation, as well as relativistic particle acceleration. Comprehensive, multidimensional diagnostics are essential to accurately characterize these so-called `plasma mirrors' (PMs). We present a direct, \\textit{in situ} measurement of the three-dimensional plasma surface evolution during femtosecond laser irradiation, achieved through simultaneous analysis of the wavefront, spectrum, and temporal profile of the reflected light. Our measurements reveal surface deformations on the order of a few hundred nanometers at relativistic intensities, in agreement with three-dimensional particle-in-cell (3D-PIC) simulations. Additionally, the PM induces substantial modifications to the pulse spectrum and temporal profile, introducing spatio-temporal couplings.         ",

REBEL is designed for collinear laser spectroscopy of ion bunches following isobaric separation with a multireflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer, enabling high-sensitivity measurements of mass-selected fast-ion beams. In contrast, STRIPE focuses on the deceleration, trapping, and laser cooling of ions in a segmented linear Paul trap, optimized for long interrogation times and precision spectroscopy. The shared infrastructure features stable high-voltage operation ($<10$ ppm), modular vacuum sections, and a fast-beam switchyard to route ions to either experiment. Initial results include a mass-resolving power of $R \\approx 12900$ in REBEL and successful ion trapping and laser cooling of ions with a kinetic energy of 10 keV in STRIPE, with improved performance achieved using a frequency-modulated cooling laser. This dual-system platform enables the development and benchmarking of advanced spectroscopy and trapping techniques and is compatible with future operation at radioactive ion beam facilities.

We systematically vary the control parameters, including the disk size, stroke length, travel time, and distance from the wall, to analyze their influence on vortex dynamics. Experiments are conducted with Particle Image Velocimetry, while numerical simulations are performed using the flow solver Basilisk. The circulation and core radius are used as primary metrics to describe the properties of the vortex ring. A quantitative agreement is observed between the experimental and the numerical results. Both approaches reveal that the vortex circulation increases for disk motions in either direction, toward or away from the wall. However, the effect of the bottom wall on the vortex core radius differs depending on the motion of the disk. The presence of the wall increases the core radius only when the disk moves toward the wall, while no significant effect is observed for a translation away from the wall. Furthermore, we establish scaling laws to describe the maximum circulation and core size of the vortex ring as a function of the control parameters: the disk diameter, the typical time and stroke length of its motion, and the minimal distance from the wall. These scalings, which differ from the unbounded case, contribute to a deeper understanding of vortex dynamics in the vicinity of solid boundaries.         ",

    "abstract": "           Nanophotonic platforms based on surface-enhanced infrared absorbance spectroscopy (SEIRAS) have emerged as an effective tool for molecular detection. Sensitive nanophotonic sensors with robust resonant modes and amplified electromagnetic near fields are essential for spectroscopy, especially in lossy environments. Metasurfaces driven by bound state in the continuum (BICs) have unlocked a powerful platform for molecular detection due to their exceptional spectral selectivity. While plasmonic BIC metasurfaces are preferred for molecular spectroscopy due to their high surface fields, enhancing the interaction with analytes, dielectric BICs have become popular due to their high-quality factors and, thus high sensitivity. However, their sensing performance has largely been demonstrated in air, neglecting the intrinsic infrared (IR) losses found in common solvents. This study evaluates the suitability of plasmonic versus dielectric platforms for in-situ molecular spectroscopy. Here, the sensing performance of plasmonic (gold) and dielectric (silicon) metasurfaces is assessed across liquid environments with varying losses resembling typical solvents. The results show that dielectric metasurfaces excel in dry conditions, while plasmonic BIC metasurfaces outperform them in lossy solvents, with a distinct crossover point where both show similar performance. Our results provide a framework for selecting the optimal metasurface material platform for SEIRAS studies based on environmental conditions.         ",

Moreover, to compute forces beyond just single-point energy calculations, one- and two-electron integral derivatives and response equations are also to be computed on classical computers. Our developed interface allows for efficient evaluation of forces with the quantum-classical hybrid framework for large chemical systems. We performed geometry optimizations and first-principles molecular dynamics calculations on typical condensed-phase systems. These included liquid water, molecular adsorption on solid surfaces, and biological enzymes. In water benchmarks with periodic boundary conditions, we confirmed that the cost of preparing second-quantized Hamiltonians and evaluating forces scales almost linearly with the simulation box size.

    "abstract": "           Recent research in 2-dimensional (2D) topological matter has generalized the notion of edge states from chiral to antichiral configurations with the same propagating direction at parallel edges, revealing a rich variety of robust transport phenomena. Here, we propose that antichiral hinge states can emerge in a 3D higher-order topological insulator/semimetal, where two surface/bulk Dirac points are connected by the hinge states. The band dispersion can be controlled and tilted independently for each hinge using properly designed tunnelings, resulting in tunable antichiral hinge states with programmable propagation direction and velocity. Moreover, we propose experimental realization schemes based on a 1D coupled cavity array with additional synthetic dimensions represented by the photonic orbital angular momentum and frequency. We innovatively introduce both longitudinal and transversal electro-optic modulators to generate the desired tunable tunnelings along the synthetic dimensions, which significantly reduce the experimental complexity by eliminating the need for beam splittings and auxiliary cavities. The tunable antichiral hinge states are confirmed by the photonic transmission spectra. Our work presents the robust and tunable antichiral hinge-state transports which paves the way for exploring novel topological matter and their device applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           Filament-based chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for silicon (Si) coatings is often treated as a straightforward adaptation of planar deposition, just with a cylindrical substrate. But this overlooks a fundamental shift in how transport phenomena and reaction kinetics interact. In filament CVD, the filament is not just a substrate; it is the dominant heat source and flow disruptor all in one. In this work, we ask: What really governs Si film growth on filaments? Using a validated three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, we show that filament geometry, thermal gradients, and flow-induced buoyancy do not merely affect uniformity -- they define the very regimes (reaction-limited, transition, diffusion-limited) in which deposition occurs. Our model, validated against three independent experimental studies (R-squared = 0.969), reveals how temperature, flow rate, and reactor layout fundamentally shift the growth dynamics. We show that reducing filament diameter from 2 mm to 500 microns does not just increase local surface area -- it can triple growth rates (up to approximately 39 microns per minute), but only in carefully tuned high-temperature regimes. Similarly, multi-filament setups do not simply scale deposition, they reshape flow fields and compound thermal asymmetries, sometimes improving uniformity, other times worsening it. These effects are not evident without modeling the interplay between transport and kinetics, something experiments alone cannot resolve. To bridge physical understanding with design actionability, we apply global sensitivity analysis via Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and Sobol indices. These reveal how in reaction-limited regimes, temperature dominates; in diffusion-limited regimes, reactant transport takes over.         ",

    "abstract": "           Complex amplitude measurement is an essential prerequisite for light field characterization. In this work, we propose a one-time measurement method to characterize the complex amplitude of symmetry superposed optical vortices (SSOVs) with only one picture registered by CCD. This method includes two strategies we proposed. One is the ring extraction strategy for amplitude measurement, and another is the rotational measurement strategy for phase measurement. In the proof-of-concept experiment, the complex amplitude is characterized, and the mode purity is well measured. This method has excellent flexibility, rapidity, and robustness, which can be applied to various occasions and harsh conditions. Careful alignment and optimized error analysis allow us to generate and measure a single component with mode purity as high as 99.99%.         ",

    "abstract": "           Longstanding anomalies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), including the low quadrupole moment and hemispherical power asymmetry, have recently been linked to an underlying parity asymmetry. We show here how this parity asymmetry naturally arises within a quantum framework that explicitly incorporates the construction of a geometric quantum vacuum based on parity ($\\mathcal{P}$) and time-reversal ($\\mathcal{T}$) transformations. This elegant framework restores unitarity in quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS). When applied to inflationary quantum fluctuations, this unitary QFTCS formalism predicts parity asymmetry as a natural consequence of cosmic expansion, which inherently breaks time-reversal symmetry. Observational data strongly favor this unitary QFTCS approach, with a Bayes factor, the ratio of marginal likelihoods associated with the model given the data $p\\left( M\\vert D \\right)$, exceeding 650 times that of predictions from the standard inflationary framework. This Bayesian approach contrasts with the standard practice in the CMB community, which evaluates $p\\left( D\\vert M \\right)$, the likelihood of the data under the model, which undermines the importance of low-$\\ell$ physics. Our results, for the first time, provide compelling evidence for the quantum gravitational origins of CMB parity asymmetry on large scales.         ",

Thanks to Kerr self-trapping, the nonlinear NHSE is demonstrated to possess much better localization strength and robustness at the preferred boundary compared to the linear case. Away from the preferred boundary, Kerr self-trapping can even inhibit NHSE-induced transport and form stable skin solitons.

Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. To enable high-resolution imaging, the upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light.

While inverse design techniques have proven very efficient in achieving small footprints, they often underutilize physical insight and rely on large parameter spaces that are challenging to explore, thereby limiting the performance of the resulting devices. Here we present a design methodology that combines inverse design with a topology based on cells, each of which contains a subwavelength metamaterial. This approach significantly reduces the parameter space, while the inherent anisotropy of the subwavelength structures yields shorter devices. We experimentally demonstrate our technique with an ultra-compact spot size converter that achieves a x24 expansion ratio times (from 0.5 um to 12 um) over a length of only 7 um, with insertion losses of 0.8 dB across a measured bandwidth of 160 nm (up to 300 nm in simulation), surpassing the state-of-the-art by a wide margin.

The circuit does not require local addressability or ancilla qubits and thus can be readily implemented in a variety of experimental platforms including trapped-ion quantum simulators and cavity QED systems. We provide analytic and numerical evidence that any $N$-qubit symmetric state can be prepared in $2N/3$ steps.

We use the widely studied cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system as an example, where an atom interacts with the environment composed of a collection of oscillators. In this scenario, the stochastic interactions between the atom and the environment can introduce non-Markovian characteristics into the evolution of quantum states, differing from the conventional Markovian dynamics observed in open quantum systems. As a result, the atom's decay rate to the environment varies with time and can be described by nonlinear equations. The solutions to these nonlinear equations can be analyzed in terms of the stability of a nonlinear control system. Consequently, the evolution of quantum state amplitudes follows linear time-varying equations as a result of the non-Markovian quantum transient process. Additionally, by using measurement feedback through homodyne detection of the cavity output, we can modulate the steady atomic and photonic states in the non-Markovian process. When multiple coupled cavity-QED systems are involved, measurement-based feedback control can influence the dynamics of high-dimensional quantum states, as well as the resulting stable and unstable subspaces.

However, the capability of KANs to simultaneously solve inverse problems over multiple irregular geometries within a single training run remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold PointNet (PI-KAN-PointNet), in which shared KANs are integrated into the PointNet architecture to capture the geometric features of computational domains. The loss function comprises the squared residuals of the governing equations, computed via automatic differentiation, along with sparse observations and partially known boundary conditions. We construct shared KANs using Jacobi polynomials and investigate their performance by considering Jacobi polynomials of different degrees and types in terms of both computational cost and prediction accuracy. As a benchmark test case, we consider natural convection in a square enclosure with a cylinder, where the cylinder's shape varies across a dataset of 135 geometries. PI-KAN-PointNet offers two main advantages. First, it overcomes the limitation of current PIKANs, which are restricted to solving only a single computational domain per training run, thereby reducing computational costs. Second, when comparing the performance of PI-KAN-PointNet with that of the physics-informed PointNet using MLPs, we observe that, with approximately the same number of trainable parameters and comparable computational cost in terms of the number of epochs, training time per epoch, and memory usage, PI-KAN-PointNet yields more accurate predictions, particularly for values on unknown boundary conditions involving nonsmooth geometries.

To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to improve gastrointestinal imaging.
