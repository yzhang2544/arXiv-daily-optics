In particular, PICs with MEMS-based modulators have the advantages of voltage-based control, ultra-low-energy consumption, cryogenic compatibility, and CMOS-foundry support. Here we report a cantilever optical modulator that utilizes hybrid piezoelectric and electrostatic tuning forces together on a monolithic silicon nitride (SiN) PIC platform. The device achieves actuation of visible-wavelength light with quasi-static tuning up to 10 kHz at 1.5 V{\\pi}-cm as well as high-speed (>20 MHz) AC modulation with dynamically adjustable (25 - 40 MHz) mechanical resonances. We report the physics of how geometric nonlinearities such as capacitive pull-in give rise to suspended and contacted cantilever modes. These reversible operating regimes generate different strain profiles and boundary conditions which are responsible for the active tuning of the mechanical resonances. Our proof-of-concept electrostatic-piezo modulator shows promising potential in large-scale programmable PICs applied to high-speed optical switching and optomechanical sensing.         ",

Microscopic imaging of nitrogen gas has been challenging due to extremely weak signals stemming from low order Raman interaction. Wide-field coherent Raman micro-spectroscopy has demonstrated the ability to chemically distinguish nitrogen gas although it has been difficult to quantify spatial-density information due to significant levels of background noise. By subtracting the Gaussian beam shape and removing contributions from uninformative noise simultaneously from the set of images, we can reconstruct the normalized intensity fluctuations. Our analysis demonstrates that nitrogen gas within microvolume can be rapidly monitored under ambient conditions in less than 0.2 seconds.

    "abstract": "           Revealing the interactions binding electronic and lattice components of cooperative quantum order is central to sculpting new states of matter. This challenge is epitomized by the charge density wave material 1T-TiSe$_2$, where photoexcitation disrupts its presumed hybrid exciton-phonon order. This exposes a paradox: the electronic component collapses within femtoseconds while the periodic lattice distortion persists. If the lattice distortion outlives the excitonic condensate, were they truly intertwined? Here we resolve this by uncovering a low-frequency mode (approx. 0.13 THz) emerging only in the ordered state, signaling exciton-phonon coupling. This mode is consistent with a locked phason -- a collective excitation arising if coupling between the excitonic condensate and lattice reduces continuous phase symmetry to a discrete one, giving the excitonic Goldstone mode finite mass. This is captured by an effective theory describing a shared potential landscape. At a critical threshold, the collapse of excitonic order flattens the potential, triggering an exciton-phonon catastrophe: selective overheating of the charge density wave phonon, disappearance of the locked phason, and sudden loss of electronic coherence. Remarkably, the lattice distortion survives as a dynamically trapped, non-thermal remnant, confirmed by the anomalous temperature dependence of the phononic response. These findings demonstrate that coupled potential energy landscapes can be manipulated to selectively dismantle complex quantum orders, advancing material control through dynamical design.         ",

Data for a range of angles of attack ($24^\\circ$ to $32^\\circ$), Reynolds numbers (3,000 to 20,000) and semispan wing aspect ratios (0.75 to $\\infty$), collapsed best when scaled with the streamwise-directed height of the chord length. The ``forcing Strouhal number'' that produced the largest lift coefficient increments, equal to $0.26 \\pm 0.04$, was linked to the conventional bluff-body Strouhal number by recognizing that drag and lift on flat plate wings are directly proportional at a fixed angle of attack. Flowfield measurements, to determine the time-averaged separation bubble height and local velocity at separation, showed that the universal Strouhal number of approximately $0.16 \\pm 0.01$ --developed for bluff-body and separation bubble vortex shedding--can be further generalized to active separation control, when the natural shedding frequency is substituted by the forcing frequency. Insect wing flapping frequencies in hover were examined on the basis of Strouhal number scaling and corresponded reasonably well to the optimum forcing Strouhal number range, although angle of attack estimates were a source of uncertainty. Furthermore, universal Strouhal number scaling can only be validated with accurate separation bubble height and separation velocity measurements.         ",

In this work, we present a computational study of LWFA in a specially designed single-stage capillary gas-cell target aimed at producing high-quality, GeV-class electron beams. The capillary cell includes a short (~2 mm) injection region at the entrance filled with a helium (He) and nitrogen (N2 ) gas mixture. This is followed by a longer (~12 mm) pure He section, which provides the required acceleration length and limits continuous ionization injection, thereby significantly reducing the energy spread of the accelerated beam. Hydrodynamic simulations are performed to optimize the capillary geometry and generate the required two-section gas-pressure profile. The resulting gas-density distributions for various cases are then directly incorporated in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations to study LWFA. In particular, our hydrodynamic simulations demonstrate how tailored density profiles with longitudinal density tapering in the acceleration section can be realized in a capillary gas cell, while the corresponding PIC simulations reveal how these profiles influence the acceleration process and the resulting beam quality. Using a 100 TW-class laser system with parameters relevant to the L2-DUHA laser at the ELI Beamlines Facility, the PIC results demonstrate electron acceleration to mean energies exceeding 1.0 GeV with high-quality beam properties. Self-injected He electrons are also observed, and their impact on the main beam quality is evaluated.

Despite its advantages, the underlying fragmentation mechanisms, their connection to the nanoparticle size distribution, and the energy efficiency of the process remain poorly understood. In this study for the first time, microparticle fragmentation is investigated in single-pulse, single-particle experiments on Au microparticles. Determining the absorbed peak fluence enables assessment of the process energetics. Pump-probe microscopy identifies photomechanical fracture of the molten microparticle volume and photothermal phase explosion of its superheated surface as the fragmentation mechanisms. We find that 83% of the absorbed laser energy is converted into cavitation bubble formation, while only 1% contributes to the surface energy of the generated nanoparticles. Despite this small fraction, MP-LFL outperforms laser ablation in liquids. The surface energy generated per absorbed energy is 10 times higher, and the overall energy efficiency is 14 times higher. This gain originates from the confined microparticle geometry, which minimizes energy losses and enhances photomechanical fragmentation via pressure focusing. These results position microparticle fragmentation in liquids as a fundamentally more energy-efficient approach for scalable, laser-based nanoparticle production than laser ablation in liquids.

Using hexagonal arrays of silver nanoparticles embedded in dye-doped waveguides, we demonstrate lasing at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, including the K and M points. K-point lasing exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in relative intensity between degenerate K and K' modes, with no bias induced by pump geometry, even for geometries that explicitly break symmetry. In contrast, M-point lasing allows deterministic control over emission channels via asymmetric pumping. We further show that spatially separated K-point lasers synchronize in phase and amplitude, undergoing SSB in lockstep. A theoretical density matrix approach cast into stochastic differential equations reproduces the observed real- and Fourier-space intensity distributions and SSB behavior.

Then, we employ emergent learning - an approach inspired by neuroscience - to exploit the vast dictionary of raw memories inherently available within a disordered optical structure, thereby engineering the optical-synaptic matrix to store a user-defined attractor, or tailored memory. Importantly these photonic structures also works as an optical comparators providing an intensity-based measure of the degree of similitude between a query pattern and the stored pattern, realizing an hardware co-localization between memory and optical operator.

These results are highly promising for large-scale silicon photonic integration, delay lines, and on-chip programmable systems.         ",

Two samples for each SCF type with three (SCF1) and four (SCF2) air holes are individually inserted in a syringe loaded with a 0.5 mL solution of CNTs dispersed in methanol, and a high-power laser at 980 nm is injected into the fibers during distinct periods: SCF1 (20 and 30 minutes), SCF2 (5 and 10 minutes). The CNT solution thermally expands, accelerating and depositing nanotubes on the fiber tip. The material and dimensions of the CNTs deposited on the SCFs' cross-section are characterized, revealing nanotube bundles increasing in thickness from the fiber core to the bridges and inside the holes. The average maximum CNT thickness widening the bridge edges is, respectively, for SCF1 (2.8 and 2 microns) and SCF2 (1.7 and 1.3 microns). These achievements are significant for nanoparticle deposition and fabrication of microscale devices on tips and inside specialty and hollow fibers, enabling innovative fiber sensors, mode-locked fiber lasers, in-fiber acousto-optic modulators, and broadband photoacoustic transmitters for imaging and neurostimulation.

Here, we report an advanced optimization framework that combines deep learning and evolutionary algorithms to significantly improve both the design and performance of chiral photonic nanostructures. Building on previous work utilizing a three-layer perceptron reinforced learning and stochastic evolutionary algorithm with decaying changes and mass extinction for chiral photonic optimization, our study introduces a refined pipeline featuring a two-output neural network architecture to reduce the trade-off between high chiral dichroism (CD) and reflectivity. Additionally, we use an improved fitness function, and efficient data augmentation techniques. A comparative analysis between a neural network (NN)-based approach and a genetic algorithm (GA) is presented for structures of different interface pattern depth, material combinations, and geometric complexity. We demonstrate a twice higher CD and the impact of both the corner number and the refractive index contrast at the example of a GaP/air and PMMA/air metasurface as a result of superior optimization performance. Additionally, a substantial increase in the number of structures explored within limited computational resources is highlighted, with tailored spectral reflectivity suggested by our electromagnetic simulations, paving the way for chiral mirrors applicable to polarization-selective light-matter interaction studies.

Yet the qubit counts and error rates required to realize such an advantage remain uncertain; resource estimates for ground-state electronic structure span orders of magnitude, and no quantum-native method has been validated at a commercially relevant scale. Here we address this uncertainty by executing the iterative qubit coupled-cluster (iQCC) algorithm, designed for fault-tolerant quantum hardware, at unprecedented scale using a quantum solver on classical processors, enabling simulations of transition organo-metallic complexes requiring hundreds of logical qubits and millions of entangling gates. Using this approach, we compute the lowest triplet excited state (T$_1$) energies of Ir(III) and Pt(II) phosphorescent organometallic compounds and show that iQCC achieves the lowest mean absolute error (0.05 eV) and highest R$^2$ (0.94) relative to experiment, outperforming leading classical methods.

    "abstract": "           A variety of photon-mediated operations are critical to the realization of scalable quantum information processing platforms and their accurate characterization is essential for the identification of optimal regimes and their experimental realizations. Such light-matter interactions are often studied with a broad variety of analytical and computational methods that are constrained by approximation techniques or by computational scaling. Quantum processors present a new avenue to address these challenges. We consider the case of cavity mediated two-qubit gates. To investigate quantum state transfer between the qubits, we implement simulations with quantum circuits that are able to reliably track the dynamics of the system. Our quantum algorithm, compatible with NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era systems, allows us to map out the fidelity of the state transfer operation between qubits as a function of a broad range of system parameters including the respective detunings between the qubits and the cavity, the damping factor of the cavity, and the respective couplings between the qubits and the cavity. The algorithm provides a robust and intuitive solution, alongside a satisfactory agreement with analytical solutions or classical simulation algorithms in their respective regimes of validity. It allows us to identify under-explored regimes of optimal performance, relevant for heterogeneous quantum platforms, where the two-qubit gate can be rather effective between far-detuned qubits that are neither resonant with each other nor with the cavity. Besides its present application, the method introduced in the current paper can be efficiently used in otherwise untractable variations of the model and in various efforts to simulate and optimize photon-mediated two-qubit gates and other relevant operations in quantum information processing.

    "abstract": "           Symmetry adaptation, universality, and gate efficiency are central but often competing requirements in quantum algorithms for electronic structure and many-body physics. For example, fully symmetry-adapted universal operator pools typically generate long and deep quantum circuits, gate-efficient universal operator pools generally break symmetries, and gate-efficient fully symmetry-adapted operator pools may not be universal. In this work, we analyze such symmetry dilemmas both theoretically and numerically. On the theory side, we prove that the popular, gate-efficient operator pool consisting of singlet spin-adapted singles and perfect-pairing doubles is not universal when spatial symmetry is enforced. To demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the three types of pools, we perform numerical simulations using an adaptive algorithm paired with operator pools that are (i) fully symmetry-adapted and universal, (ii) fully symmetry-adapted and non-universal, and (iii) breaking a single symmetry and are universal. Our numerical simulations encompass three physically relevant scenarios in which the target state is (i) the global ground state, (ii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in multiple symmetry properties, and (iii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in a single symmetry property. Our results show when symmetry-breaking but universal pools can be used safely, when enforcing at least one distinguishing symmetry suffices, and when a particular symmetry must be rigorously preserved to avoid variational collapse. Together, the formal and numerical analysis provides a practical guide for designing and benchmarking symmetry-adapted operator pools that balance universality, resource requirements, and robust state targeting in quantum simulations for chemistry.

By organizing the cavity and magnon fields in a systematic expansion in $\\epsilon$, we obtain compact analytic expressions for the spectra up to second order. Using these results, we reproduce the characteristic sideband structure observed in recent Floquet cavity electromagnonics experiments. Furthermore, accounting for the Zeeman interaction between the modulation field and the fully polarized ground state - a contribution typically neglected in previous treatments - we predict an additional magnon detuning of approximately $0.8\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$, independent of both modulation frequency and sample size and determined solely by the spatial volume occupied by the modulation field.

Our analysis reveals a dual mechanism behind the drastic suppression of thermal conductivity in bundles: first, the breaking of rotational symmetry in isolated SWCNTs dramatically enhances the scattering rates of symmetry-sensitive phonon modes, such as the twist (TW) mode. Second, the emergence of new inter-tube phonon modes introduces abundant additional scattering channels across the entire frequency spectrum. Crucially, the incorporation of quantum Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics is essential to accurately capture these phenomena, enabling our approach to quantitatively reproduce experimental observations. This work establishes the combination of ML-driven interatomic potentials and ALD-BTE as a predictive framework for nanoscale thermal transport, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental measurements.

This approach significantly simplifies the design compared to microresonator-based methods and enables both pumping and collection of photon pairs entirely in the telecom band.

    "abstract": "           The question of how to interpret and compute arrival-time distributions in quantum mechanics remains unsettled, reflecting the longstanding tension between treating time as a quantum observable or as a classical parameter. Most previous studies have focused on the single-particle case in the far-field regime, where both approaches yield very similar arrival-time distributions and a semi-classical analysis typically suffices. Recent advances in atom-optics technologies now make it possible to experimentally investigate arrival-time distributions for entangled multi-particle systems in the near-field regime, where a deeper analysis beyond semi-classical approximations is required. Even in the far-field regime, due to quantum non-locality, the semi-classical approximation cannot generally hold in multi-particle systems. Therefore, in this work, two fundamental approaches to the arrival-time problem -- namely, the time-parameter and time-operator approaches -- are extended to multi-particle systems. Using these extensions, we propose a feasible two-particle arrival-time experiment and numerically evaluate the corresponding joint distributions. Our results reveal regimes in which the two approaches yield inequivalent predictions, highlighting conditions under which experiments could shed new light on distinguishing between competing accounts of time in quantum mechanics. Our findings also provide important insights for the development of quantum technologies that use entanglement in the time domain, including non-local temporal interferometry, temporal ghost imaging, and temporal state tomography in multi-particle systems.

The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) technique is employed, utilizing both the unitary coupled-cluster method with singles and doubles (UCCSD) and adaptive ans\u00e4tze within active spaces extracted from the larger material system. We explore active spaces of (6e,6o), (8e,8o), and (10e,10o), corresponding to 12, 16, and 20 qubits, respectively, and simulate them using CUDA-Q's GPU-accelerated state-vector simulator. Gate fusion is shown to decrease circuit evaluation time by 2-3$\\times$, while parameter shift decreases the number of epochs required for variational convergence. The ADAPT-VQE method decreases both the number of epochs required for convergence and reduces the number of circuit parameters across all active spaces, at the cost of an increased number of circuit evaluations. Combining ADAPT-VQE with the 1- and 2-electron integrals from a CASSCF calculation recovers more correlation energy, at the cost of increased computational time. The CO$_2$ binding energy is computed, and we observe and discuss how increasing the active space size can lead to uneven recovery of correlation energy, making the predicted binding energies variable, even positive (\\textit{i.e.}, energetically unfavorable) in some instances. This can be partially remedied by using an alternative approach to computing the binding energy that more evenly spreads the active space.

    "title": "Ultrafast Optical Probing of Laser Processing",
    "abstract": "           Laser treatment has emerged into a cornerstone of industrial manufacturing. This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter, particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing. This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques (where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \\mu s) with respect to the arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases, shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring, etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future trends.

    "title": "How Does Incubation Affect Laser Material Processing?",
    "abstract": "           In the last decades, the subject of laser-induced damage (LID) moved from a topic of scientific interest toward laser material processing for technical applications. When using pulsed lasers, the cumulative effect known as incubation is one of the most fundamental features of the processing event. Incubation manifests by the fact that the critical fluence for LID (known as laser-induced damage threshold, LIDT) depends on the number of pulses N exciting one spot on the sample. In most cases, the threshold fluence decreases with N starting from the single-shot ablation threshold and remains constant for large N. No ablation or damage occurs for any N, if the fluence is kept below the multiple-pulse threshold. In contrast, examples where the LIDT increases with N have been reported. The latter effect is known as laser conditioning and is advantageously used when ramping up the power of high-power laser systems. Incubation has been described for many types of solids; the motivation for these comprehensive efforts is twofold. Firstly, one tries to prevent the damage of optical materials in the beam path of high-energy or high-peak-power lasers. Secondly, one deliberately uses this damage for the sculpting of components. In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the mechanisms of incubation. We are going to look at the parameters controlling LID and highlight the peculiarity of the parameter \"number of pulses\". We will give an overview of the experimental work done in a variety of materials. There are several physical and chemical mechanisms proposed that govern incubation, and there are several mathematical models to describe the behavior of threshold fluence and ablation rate in dependence on the number of pulses. In a few cases, the two classes of mechanisms are even related to each other. Eventually, we will show the implications that incubation has on real-world laser machining.         ",

    "abstract": "           Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling, from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence, the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids. We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.         ",

    "title": "Strong coupling of collective optical resonances in dielectric metasurfaces",
    "abstract": "           Dielectric metasurfaces can achieve strong light-matter interaction based on several types of collective (nonlocal) resonances, such as surface lattice resonances (SLRs) and quasi bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs). Spectral selectivity, field enhancement, and high and controllable Q-factors make these resonances appealing for technological applications in lasing, sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photon sources. An emerging challenge focuses on tailoring light-matter interaction via mode coupling and hybridization between the fundamental resonances of a metasurface. While strong coupling phenomena have been demonstrated between various resonant modes, the interplay between collective resonances of different natures has not been observed to date. Here, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrate the onset of coupling and hybridization between symmetry-protected quasi-BICs and SLRs in a dielectric metasurface. We show the emergence of anticrossing (or Rabi splitting) in the strong coupling regime with suppression of reflection, observed under TE-polarised excitation, and the manifestation of an accidental BIC under TM-polarised illumination as a result of energy exchange between the participating collective resonances in the weak coupling regime. The first effect is accompanied by hybridized near fields of the modes. The observed coupling mechanisms can be controlled by modifying the angle of incidence, polarisation, and surrounding environment. This foundational study on the coupling and hybridization of collective resonances offers insights that can be leveraged for the design of metasurfaces with targeted quasi-aBIC and collective hybridized resonances. It could also open new possibilities to control the near fields associated with such resonances, with promising applications in tunable nanophotonics and light manipulation.         ",

    "abstract": "           Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g., conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study, understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces.

A closely related concept is \\textit{photonic doping}, where subwavelength nonmagnetic dielectric materials embedded in ENZ media enable exotic responses such as perfect-magnetic-conductor behavior and simultaneous epsilon- and mu-near-zero states. However, photonic doping has remained limited to microwave and far-infrared regimes due to the intrinsic losses of optical ENZ materials. Here, photonic doping is demonstrated at optical frequencies by embedding a periodic array of dielectric Mie resonators into an ultralow-loss, all-dielectric ENZ platform based on near-cutoff Bragg microcavities. The resulting structures support spectrally isolated, quasi-singular coupled Bragg--Mie resonances spanning electric and magnetic multipolar orders and their overtones. These modes exhibit effective near-zero-index dispersion with fields confined either within or between the nanoparticles. A representative \\(14\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\)-scale doped structure exhibits quality factors approaching \\(10^{4}\\) and magnetic-dipole Purcell enhancements exceeding \\(5\\times10^{3}\\) in the near-infrared. The demonstrated platform elevates the photonic doping from a microwave-only concept to a fully optical, low-loss, and multipole-resolved platform, enabling ultra-narrowband Mie-like resonances, enhanced magnetic-light interactions, and new opportunities in multipolar-selective spectroscopy and lasing, low-threshold nonlinear optics and efficient single-photon emission.

    "abstract": "           Red blood cells (RBCs) sustain mechanical stresses associated with microcirculatory flow through ATP-driven plasma membrane flickering. This is an active phenomenon driven by motor proteins that regulate interactions between the spectrin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer; it is manifested in RBC shape fluctuations reflecting the cell's mechanical and metabolic state. Yet, direct quantification of the forces and energetic costs underlying this non-equilibrium behavior remains challenging due to the invasiveness of existing techniques. Here, a minimally invasive method that combines bead-free, low-power optical tweezers with high-speed video microscopy was employed to track local membrane forces and displacements in single RBCs during the same time window. This independent dual-channel measurement enabled the construction of a mechano-dynamic phase space for RBCs under different chemical treatments, that allowed for differentiating between metabolic and structural states based on their fluctuation-force signatures. Quantification of mechanical work during flickering demonstrated that membrane softening enhanced fluctuations while elevating energy dissipation. The proposed optical tweezers methodology provides a robust framework for mapping the active mechanics of living cells, enabling precise probing of cellular physiology and detection of biomechanical dysfunction in diseases.

These interactions may affect the observed Garrett-Munk wave energy spectrum, in addition to the recently explored interaction of waves with ocean eddies. According to the resonant wave interaction approximation, that is commonly used to derive the kinetic equation for the energy spectrum, the dominant interactions are between wave triads whose wavevectors satisfy $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{p}+\\mathbf{q}$, and whose frequencies satisfy $\\omega_{\\mathbf{k}}=|\\omega_{\\mathbf{p}}\\pm\\omega_{\\mathbf{q}}|$. In order to test the validity of the resonant wave interaction approximation, we examine several analytical derivations of the theory. The assumptions underlying each derivation are tested using idealized direct 2D numerical simulations, representing near-observed energy levels of the oceanic internal wave field. We show that the slow-amplitude assumptions underlying the derivations are inconsistent with the simulated dynamics in this particular set of simulations. In addition, most of the triads satisfying the resonant conditions do not contribute significantly to nonlinear wave energy transfer in our simulations, while some interactions that are dominant in nonlinear energy transfers do not satisfy the resonance conditions. We also point to possible self-consistency issues with some derivations found in the literature.         ",

To understand the physical mechanism behind super-resolved spot formation, we employ a variational master equation for the density matrix, incorporating both radiative and non-radiative decay processes. A suitably chosen spatiotemporal envelope of the structured beams enables the formation of a super-resolved image. Unwanted low-intensity circular rings around the focal spot are suppressed using Bessel-modulated truncated structured Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) and super-Gaussian (SG) beams. We also study the temperature dependence of the imaging scheme. The numerical results confirm that at low pulse areas, exciton-phonon coupling distorts the image, whereas at higher pulse areas, exciton-phonon decoupling preserves the image resolution. Hence, the proposed scheme may open up new possibilities for nanoscale imaging and bioimaging applications using QDs.         ",

Adding more lines without preliminary thermal modeling to make predictions risks overwhelming the cooling power at each thermal stage. In this paper, we investigate the thermal load of SC-086/50-SCN-CN semi-rigid coaxial cable, which is commonly used for the control and readout lines of a superconducting quantum computer, as we increase the number of lines to a quantum processor. We investigate the makeup of the coaxial cables, verify the materials and dimensions, and experimentally measure the total thermal conductivity of a single cable as a function of the temperature from cryogenic to room temperature values. We also measure the cryogenic DC electrical resistance of the inner conductor as a function of temperature, allowing for the calculation of active thermal loads due to Ohmic heating. Fitting this data produces a numerical thermal conductivity function used to calculate the static heat loads due to thermal transfer within the wires resulting from a temperature gradient. The resistivity data is used to calculate active heat loads, and we use these fits in a cryogenic model of a superconducting quantum processor in a typical Bluefors XLD1000-SL dilution refrigerator, investigating how the thermal load increases with processor sizes ranging from 100 to 225 qubits. We conclude that the theoretical upper limit of the described architecture is approximately 200 qubits.

By proposing the use of a correlation energy functional and sampling of a polynomial set of excitation amplitudes of the quantum state, we can demonstrate an almost two order of magnitude reduction in required number of shots for a given statistical error in the energy estimate, as well as observing a linear scaling to accessible system sizes. Furthermore, we find a high-degree of noise resilience of these estimators on real quantum devices, with up to an order of magnitude increase in the tolerated noise compared to traditional techniques. While these approaches are expected to break down asymptotically, we find strong evidence that these large system arguments do not prevent algorithmic advantage from these simple protocols in many systems of interest. We further extend this to consider the extraction of beyond-energetic properties by mapping to a coupled cluster surrogate model, as well as a natural combination within a quantum embedding framework.

    "abstract": "           Multiport interferometers can be constructed from two-port components in various configurations. We investigate how these configurations influence the performance of quantum operations through asymmetries in optical losses. Using numerical simulations, we analyze the effect of photon-loss distributions on the fidelity of operations involving measurements. For both full- and partial-measurement protocols, we compare rectangular (symmetric-loss) and triangular (asymmetric-loss) architectures. Our results show that asymmetric loss configurations can reduce operation infidelity in several cases, revealing a quantifiable trade-off between fidelity and success probability, with implications for the design of high-fidelity photonic circuits.

    "title": "Machine-Learning-Guided Insights into Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Conductivity: Are Amorphous Lithium Fluorophosphates the Key?",
    "abstract": "           Despite decades of study, the identity of the dominant \\ce{Li+}-conducting phase within the inorganic SEI of Li-ion batteries remains unresolved. While the mosaic model describes LiF/\\ce{Li2O}/\\ce{Li2CO3} nanocrystallites within a disordered matrix, these crystalline phases inherently offer limited ionic conductivity. Growing evidence suggests that interfaces, grain boundaries, and amorphous phases may instead host the primary fast-ion pathways. Using diffusion-based generative structure prediction and machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we investigate lithium difluorophosphate (\\ce{LiPO2F2}), a key mixed-anion decomposition product of phosphorus- and fluorine-containing electrolytes. We identify a stable crystalline polymorph and demonstrate that the amorphous counterpart is conductive, with projected room-temperature $\\sigma \\approx 0.18$ mS cm$^{-1}$ and $E_\\mathrm{a} \\approx 0.40$ eV. This enhancement stems from structural disorder flattening the Li site-energy landscape and a low formation energy for Li-interstitial defects, which supplies additional mobile carriers. We propose amorphous mixed-anion Li--P--O--F phases as a promising conducting medium in the SEI, offering a specific target for engineering improved battery interfaces.         ",

    "abstract": "           To elucidate low-frequency vibrational modes, we investigate a benzoxazolium--coumarin (BCO+) donor-pi-acceptor derivative using transmission terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The retrieved complex refractive index reveals distinct modes at 0.62, 0.85, 1.30, 1.81, and 2.07 THz. Gas-phase density functional theory (DFT) agrees well with these features and enables assignment of specific intramolecular motions. Together, THz-TDS and DFT identify the characteristic low-frequency modes of BCO+ and suggest their connection to intramolecular charge transfer-relevant nuclear motions, highlighting that THz-TDS can serve as a sensitive probe of vibrational signatures in donor-pi-acceptor systems.

    "abstract": "           This study develops a theoretical framework for modeling acoustic pulse propagation in a non-ideal shallow-water waveguide. We derive an {\\epsilon}-pseudodifferential operator ({\\epsilon}-PDO) formulation from the general three-dimensional wave equation, that accounts for vertical stratification, bottom interaction, and slow horizontal inhomogeneity. Using the operator separation of variables method and the WKB-ansatz, we obtain single-mode equations describing the evolution of amplitude and phase along rays. The approach incorporates non-self-adjoint operators to model energy leakage through the bottom and introduces a Hamiltonian formalism for eikonal and transport equations, enabling the computation of amplitude, time, and phase fronts. Analytical and numerical examples are provided for different boundary conditions, including Neumann (ideal), self-adjoint, and partially reflecting interfaces. The results extend previous semiclassical and ray-based theories of wave propagation by including dissipative effects and improving the physical realism of shallow-water acoustic modeling.         ",

    "abstract": "           We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive\" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.         ",
