    "title": "Quantum Monogamy with Predetermined Events",
    "abstract": "           The concept of correlation appears straightforward: measurement outcomes coincide, and patterns emerge. For any record of events, the coefficients are uniquely determined. Thus, if correlations change spontaneously, as seen in quantum monogamy, then individual behavior must have changed first. Surprisingly, this is not always true. When two observables are mutually exclusive, they cannot coincide objectively and need to be grouped across time. Yet, sectioning the flow of events into \"iterations\" is not trivial in this case. Even with blind windows of coincidence, the same order of outcomes can produce different coefficients of correlation, depending on the number of joint measurements. Therefore, quantum monogamy can happen with fixed pre-determined events. A new concept (\"subjective correlation\") is required to explain this phenomenon.         ",

    "abstract": "           Gender imbalance in Physics remains a persistent global challenge, and Brazil is no exception. While women account for only 24% of Physics faculty in the country, their representation in Quantum Physics is even smaller. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive overview of women working in Theoretical Quantum Physics in Brazil, here referred to as the SheQ (She + Quantum) community. Using data from the CNPq Lattes platform, we identify 93 researchers and analyze their geographic distribution, academic trajectories, scientific productivity, international experience, recognition through awards and fellowships, and engagement with initiatives promoting gender equity. Our results reveal both progress and persistent disparities: SheQ researchers have a strong scientific output, leadership roles, and international training; yet, their recognition through productivity fellowships remains modest, and their involvement in gender-related initiatives, although increasing among younger generations, remains limited. By combining quantitative indicators with institutional perspectives, we highlight structural barriers as well as opportunities for fostering a more inclusive environment in Quantum Physics. his study thus contributes to a broader reflection on how diversity not only promotes fairness but also strengthens creativity, innovation, and scientific progress.

    "abstract": "           Dualities in physics have challenged traditional forms of scientific realism by undermining the idea that theories describe a unique underlying ontology. In this paper, we develop a new perspective on scientific realism that responds to this challenge. We argue that while realist commitment remains appropriate at the level of a theory's full formal structure, ontological commitment should be treated as tied to specific empirical contexts rather than to a fixed, real ontology. Our proposal draws inspiration from Dennett's notion of a \"compression algorithm\" as a defining criterion of a scientific theory. On this basis, we separate realism from ontological commitment. To clarify the stakes of this distinction, we contrast our approach with common core realism, which locates ontology in the invariant structure shared by dual models. Focusing on dualities in quantum mechanics and string theory, we show how our view accommodates ontological pluralism while preserving a robust form of structural realism.         ",

    "abstract": "           Light interacting with plant leaves undergoes reflection, transmission, scattering, and absorption, which together determine leaf optical properties. Changes in leaf architecture disrupt internal light scattering dynamics and consequently affect photosynthetic performance. Previous studies on internal leaf light scattering have primarily relied on ray-tracing approaches (e.g., Raytran) or radiative-transfer models (e.g., PROSPECT). However, these high-frequency approximations cannot capture diffraction and coherent multiple scattering in wavelength-scale leaf tissues, unlike full-wave electromagnetic simulations. Here, we employ GPU-accelerated Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations to model internal light scattering dynamics using segmented cross-section image geometries of representative dicot and monocot leaves with wavelength-dependent complex refractive indices. The simulations accurately reproduce the reflectance and transmittance characteristics of healthy leaves, showing strong agreement with the PROSPECT model, with average Lin's concordance values of 0.8962 for dicot leaves and 0.7849 for monocot leaves. We further simulate early-stage necrotrophic fungal infection by modeling melanized hyphae penetrating the cuticle and upper epidermis. Diseased leaves exhibit a pronounced reduction in visible green reflectance and a marked suppression of the near-infrared reflectance plateau, consistent with experimental observations. Remaining discrepancies in the visible band are expected to be reduced through more advanced geometric and material modeling. This proof-of-concept study presents a full-wave FDTD optical modeling framework for plant-leaf light scattering, enabling physics-based analysis of internal scattering before and after early-stage fungal penetration and supporting the use of light scattering as an indicator for pre-symptomatic plant fungal disease detection.

Moreover, the experimental results via an optical microcavity demonstrate a potential sensing resolution of 4 $\\times$ 10\\textsuperscript{-6} \\degree C and 18 p$\\epsilon$ respectively for temperature and strain, and further verify the feasibility of simultaneous sensing of the two parameters.

    "abstract": "           Optical spectrometers are widely used in scientific and industrial applications, and precise frequency calibration is essential for ensuring their reliable performance. Traditionally, spectrometers have been calibrated using reference gas cells or reference lamps. However, such conventional methods are not enough to meet the demands for high accuracy and stability. Although frequency-stabilized lasers offer excellent frequency uncertainty, they provide only a single calibration point at a fixed frequency, which is unsuitable for wide-range spectrometer calibration. In this work, we demonstrate a fully stabilized, high-repetition rate electro-optic frequency comb (EO comb) as an absolute frequency reference providing multiple calibration points over a broad spectral range. Our 25 GHz EO comb provides a broadband spectrum spanning from 189.5 THz to 196 THz (corresponding to 1530 nm to 1582 nm), traceable to a frequency standard with a relative standard uncertainty of 10^-13. The well-defined and evenly spaced comb modes can be spectrally resolved by conventional optical spectrometers, enabling wide-range, high-precision frequency calibration. We directly calibrated a commercial spectrometer by referencing its measured frequency values to our well-defined comb modes, thereby evaluating the frequency error with a standard uncertainty of 20 MHz (or relative standard uncertainty of 10^-7), which is limited by the Type A uncertainty (repeatability) of the spectrometer. The proposed method is simple to implement and provides multiple calibration points referenced to the frequency standards over a broad spectral range. This approach improves both the calibration and performance evaluation of spectrometers, and it contributes to the advancement of optical metrology.         ",

We show that under periodic modulation of the cavity length sidebands spaced by the modulation frequency are produced (diffraction in time), enabling the coupling of bound surface acoustic waves with bulk radiation i.e. from a bound state \\textit{to} the continuum. We observe the negative-frequency spectra as spatial reflections along the array via time-domain finite element simulations. Spectral $k$-gaps are observed at band crossings, with the width of the gap proportional to the modulation amplitude.

Specifically, we show that the frequency associated with oscillations present in time-resolved second-order cross correlation functions quantifies not only the time scale of coherent energy transfer but also the degree of delocalization of the exciton eigenstates. Furthermore, we show that time-resolved cross correlations directly witness steady-state electronic coherence.

Our system is governed by two coherently coupled nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations, describing the polarization evolution of light in a dispersive nonlinear optical fiber. The analysis reveals the emergence of two fundamentally distinct turbulent regimes. In a first regime, the waves undergo a slow, irreversible thermalization process, which is accurately described by the wave turbulence kinetic equation and the associated H-theorem of entropy growth. In stark contrast with this expected irreversible process, we identify a second different regime, where strong phase-correlations spontaneously emerge, giving rise to a fast reversible oscillatory dynamics of the normal correlator and anomalous phase-correlator. Experimental observations confirm the occurrence of both irreversible thermalization and reversible dynamics mediated by the anomalous correlated fluctuations.         ",

    "abstract": "           Dense tracking environments in experiments at CERN's High-Luminosity LHC and future FCC experiments call for an increased use of timing information in addition to the position measurement of pixel detectors. This adds one dimension to the information available, and is essential for pile-up mitigation at high luminosity. The CASSIA sensor project (CMOS Active SenSor with Internal Amplification) focuses on the development of pixel matrices with internal charge multiplication based on monolithic CMOS sensor technologies suitable for application as charged particle tracking and timing detectors. CMOS sensors with in-pixel internal amplification would result in higher signal amplitudes having an improved signal-to-noise ratio, better time resolution and increased sensitivity, making them attractive for high-radiation environments. Their monolithic integration in small pixels reduces the input capacitance of a front-end amplifier and power dissipation making it suitable for fine-pitch low-power detectors. Fast signal rise time due to internal charge amplification improves the response time and timing resolution, all of which makes such a technology attractive for future 4D tracking applications in HEP experiments. This paper presents the first results of the CASSIA sensor, a novel MAPS which uses gain layers fully integrated in a 180nm imaging process to achieve internal signal amplification. In the first measurements presented here we demonstrate the gain behaviour of different pixel implant designs and show that the sensor can be operated with low gain proportional mode as LGAD sensor at lower voltages and as SPAD sensor at higher voltages.

    "abstract": "           The characteristic features of the resonant trident process (Oleinik resonances) have been theoretically studied in a wide range of frequencies and intensities of a circularly polarized strong electromagnetic wave. The resonant trident process is defined by two characteristic quantum energies: the characteristic energy of the nonlinear Compton effect and the characteristic energy of the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. These characteristic energies depend significantly on the frequency and intensity of the wave, as well as on the angle between the momenta of the initial electrons and the electromagnetic wave. The resonant trident process is effective when the energy of the initial electrons is greater than or on the order of magnitude of the corresponding characteristic energies. It is shown that quantum entanglement of final particles takes place in this resonant process. An important aspect of the resonant trident process is the equality of the energies of the electron and positron pairs. Analytical expressions for the differential rates of the resonant trident process on the energy of final particles are obtained. The corresponding analytical expressions for full rates have also been obtained. It is shown that the rate data of the resonant trident process in the field of optical and X-ray wave frequencies significantly exceed the corresponding rate of the non-resonant trident process. Results obtained can be used in experiments at leading laser centers, as well as to explain QED processes in strong X-ray fields near neutron stars and magnetars.         ",

The lossy electromagnetic resonances of photonic, plasmonic or magnonic nanostructures are described as quasinormal modes (QNMs), whose properties and interactions with quantum emitters and spin qubits are central to the understanding of dissipative nano-optics and magnetodielectric cQED. Despite recent advancements toward a fully quantum framework for QNMs, a general and universally accepted approach to QNM quantization for arbitrary linear media remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical framework, based on macroscopic QED and complex coordinate transformations, that achieves QNM quantization for a wide class of spatially inhomogeneous, dissipative (with possible gain components) and dispersive, linear, magnetodielectric resonators. The complex coordinate transformations equivalently convert the radiative losses into non-radiative material dissipation, and via a suitable transformation that reflects all the losses of the resonator, we define creation and annihilation operators that allow the construction of modal Fock states for the joint excitations of field-dressed matter. By directly addressing the intricacies of modal loss in a fully quantum theory of magnetodielectric cQED, our approach enables the exploration of modern, quantum nano-optical experiments utilizing dielectric, plasmonic, magnetic or hybrid cQED architectures, and paves the way towards a rigorous assessment of room-temperature quantum nanophotonic technologies without recourse to ad hoc quantization schemes.

    "abstract": "           Rydberg atom radio frequency sensors are unique in a number of ways, including possessing extraordinary carrier bandwidth, self-calibration and accuracy. In this paper, we examine the impact of thermal radiation on Rydberg atom sensors. Antennas are limited by their thermal background, while Rydberg atom sensors are coherent sensors. Incoherent thermal radiation does not limit Rydberg atom sensors in the same way as an antenna. The primary consequence of a thermal radiation field on Rydberg atom sensors is to decrease their coherence, as the decay rates of the Rydberg states used for sensing the radio frequency field are increased due to the thermal field, i.e. blackbody, modification of the atomic decay rates. Thermal and coherent field excitation are fundamentally different in that thermal fields produce statistically independent excitations with well-defined frequency, polarization, and propagation direction, while coherent states are coherent superpositions of photon number states. Consequently, thermal fields do not contribute to the coherences of the density matrix that are used for Rydberg atom sensing, except for damping them.         ",

The spontaneous as well as the coherent components of the radiation are calculated describing the ionization dynamics via the strong field approximation and the role of the quantum dynamics at tunneling is analyzed. The competition between different mechanisms in different spectral regions is examined. Transition-like radiation (Brunel radiation) is dominated at low-frequencies, Thomson scattering at the laser frequency, and radiative recombination via the three-step process at high-order harmonics. To distinguish the role of the quantum dynamics, simple man Drude models are developed for the coherent as well as for spontaneous radiation, which are based on the electron trajectory out of the tunneling barrier. The quantum dynamics is shown to modify the coherent Brunel radiation for near-zero-frequencies in asymmetric laser pulses. The significant role of free-free transitions is demonstrated for the spontaneous radiation in the low-frequency region.         ",

The chip architecture, in-pixel front-end, laboratory and in-beam characterisation, susceptibility to single-event effects, and series testing are discussed. The testing campaign validates the design of a wafer-scale stitched sensor and the performance of the pixel matrix to be within the ITS3 requirements.

    "abstract": "           Thermomechanical infrared (IR) detectors have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional photon and thermoelectric sensors, offering broadband sensitivity and low noise without the need for cryogenic cooling. Despite recent advances, the field still lacks a unified framework to guide the design of these nanomechanical systems. This work addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive design guide for IR thermal detectors based on silicon nitride drumhead and trampolines. Leveraging a validated analytical model, we systematically explore how geometry, tensile stress, and optical properties influence key performance metrics such as thermal time constant, noise-equivalent power, and specific detectivity. The analysis encompasses both bare silicon nitride and structures with broadband absorber layers, revealing how different parameter regimes affect the trade-off between sensitivity and response speed. Rather than focusing on a single device architecture, this study maps out a broad design space, enabling performance prediction and optimisation for a variety of application requirements. As such, it serves not only as a reference for benchmarking existing devices but also as a practical tool for engineering next-generation IR sensors that can operate close to the fundamental detection limit. This work is intended as a foundational resource for researchers and designers aiming to tailor IR detectors to specific use cases.         ",

    "abstract": "           High-speed thermal imaging in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) is critical for applications from autonomous navigation to medical screening, yet existing uncooled detectors are fundamentally constrained. Resistive bolometers are limited by electronic noise and the parasitic thermal load of wired readouts, while state-of-the-art nanomechanical resonators typically rely on vacuum packaging to maintain the mechanical $Q$ needed for sensitivity. Here, we introduce and demonstrate an uncooled thermal detector that addresses these challenges via an all-optical transduction mechanism. The heterogeneously integrated pixel is engineered for minimal thermal mass, combining pyrolytic carbon absorbers for broadband LWIR absorption, hollow zirconia structures for ultra-low-conductance thermal isolation, and a silicon photonic crystal cavity that serves as a high-$Q$ optical thermometer. Operating at ambient temperature and pressure, we measure a specific detectivity of $1.1\\times10^{7}$ Jones and a thermal time constant of $27~\\mu \\mathrm{s}$, corresponding to a speed that surpasses typical high-sensitivity uncooled technologies by an order of magnitude. Based on this detectivity measurement, which is limited by the noise floor of the external optical detection electronics, a physics-based model predicts a $>25\\text{-fold}$ performance enhancement to its fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited value ($3\\times10^{8}$ Jones). The optical readout remains functional across ambient and vacuum environments.

While surface immobilization has been widely used to extend observation times, it could disrupt molecular dynamics and impede biological function. Moreover, the study of weak molecular interactions requires high local concentrations, often leading to problems with signal saturation in fluorescence-based approaches. Recent advancements in single-molecule trapping techniques have addressed some limitations, but achieving precise, controllable, long-term trapping in a molecularly crowded environment without external forces remains difficult.

Our data also show that an applied electric field can modulate the conformational properties of macromolecules, emphasizing a key advantage of our device: it does not require an electric field to retain trapped molecules.

Focusing on the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We provide evidence that the nature of the instability stems from stiffness of the dynamics of the variational parameters, despite the absence of stiffness in the exact quantum dynamics. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.

The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) as well as cell-cell communication topologies with explicit causal directionality. The resulting synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies: standard correlation-based analyses (Pearson and Spearman) fail to recover the programmed causal pathways and instead report spurious associations driven by high baseline gene-expression probabilities.

In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.
