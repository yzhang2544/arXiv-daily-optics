    "abstract": "           Apertureless scanning near-field optical microscopy (a-SNOM) is typically limited to ~10 nm resolution by the tip apex size. We demonstrate that ~1-nm resolution can be achieved under continuous-wave (CW) illumination by exploiting Fano path interference. A defect center that naturally forms at the apex of a metal-coated AFM tip acts as a quantum object and induces Fano interference, forcing a stronger but normally off-resonant plasmonic mode (597 nm) to operate effectively on resonance at the driving wavelength (520 nm). Because this interference occurs only beneath the defect, a ~1-nm-wide, strongly enhanced near-field hotspot is created. Using this off-resonant Fano-enhanced field, we achieve single-molecule-resolution imaging based on exact three-dimensional Maxwell simulations.         ",

Yet in Latin America, there is no consolidated, region wide integration of quantum computing into secondary education, and the feasibility conditions for doing so remain largely unexamined. This paper proposes a qualitative, comparative framework to assess academic readiness for quantum education across six countries - Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia - grounded in the relationship between curriculum compatibility and enabling conditions spanning institutional capacity, teacher preparation, infrastructure, and equity. Using official curricula, policy documents, national statistics, and educational reports, we apply structured qualitative coding and a 1-5 ordinal scoring system to generate a cross country diagnosis. The findings reveal substantial regional asymmetries: among the six countries studied, Chile emerges as the most institutionally prepared for progressive quantum education integration, while the remaining countries exhibit varying combinations of curricular gaps and fragmented but promising enabling conditions. Building on this diagnosis, we propose a country sensitive, regionally coordinated roadmap for staged implementation, beginning with teacher development and pilot centers, leveraging open source platforms and local language resources, and scaling toward gradual curricular integration. This work establishes a baseline for future quantitative and mixed method studies evaluating learning outcomes, motivation, and scalable models for quantum education in Latin America.         ",

According to the orientation of orbital angular momentum, optical vortices can be classified into spatial optical vortex beam carrying longitudinalorbital angular momentum and spatiotemporal optical vortices carrying transverse orbital angular momentum. As an emerging subset of optical vortices, polygonal optical vortices provide a unique platform for a wide range of frontier applications by introducing a new degree of freedom in the form of a customizable intensity structure. In the spatial domain, polygonal spatial optical vortex beam carrying longitudinal orbital angular momentum have already demonstrated great potential in optical manipulation and two-photon lithography.

In this work, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortices wavepackets embedded with prescribed vortex structures. Within the structure, a prescribed number of sub spatiotemporal optical vortices carrying transverse orbital angular momentum is set along a designed polygonal spatiotemporal trajectory. Using the spatiotemporal holographic shaping approach, we generate polygonal perfect spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepacket and use the combination of multiple polygonal perfect spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepacket to form polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepacket with the prescribed vortex structure. A full control over multiple key properties of the polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepackets such as the geometry, number of phase singularities, and spatiotemporal distribution of sub spatiotemporal optical vortices is also achieved.

We develop a theoretical framework using the photoacoustic wave equation to model acoustic wave generation and propagation in metal substrates, enabling systematic optimization of laser parameters. The model identifies key scaling relationships: surface acceleration scales as $\\tau^{-2}$ with pulse duration, while acoustic diffraction sets fundamental limits on optimal spot size $w \\gtrsim \\sqrt{v\\tau d}$. Material figures of merit combine thermal expansion and optical absorption properties, suggesting alternatives to traditional aluminum substrates. The framework validates well against experimental data and demonstrates that compact laser systems with sub-nanosecond pulse durations can achieve performance competitive with existing laboratory-scale implementations despite orders-of-magnitude lower pulse energies. This enables rational design of minimal LIAD systems for practical applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           An alternative extreme learning machine -ELM- paradigm is presented exploiting random non-linearities -RN, named RN-ELM, instead of a conventional fixed node non-linearity. This method is implemented on a hybrid neural engine, with the physical layer realized by an integrated silicon photonic mesh and the digital layer by a simple regression algorithm. Non-linearities are intrinsically non-power depended and are generated through non-linear frequency to power mapping offered by optical filters. The numerical evaluation is based on an experimentally derived transfer function of an all-pass filter, implemented on a silicon reconfigurable photonic integrated chip -RPIC. RN-ELM is evaluated in a twofold manner; first as a machine learning scheme, where the expressivity offered by multiple, yet random, activation functions lead to a compact and highly simplified design with 5 optical filters, offering state-of-the-art performance in time-series prediction tasks with minimum hardware requirements. The second scenario entails its deployment as a physical unclonable function -PUF, for authentication applications directly in the physical layer. In this case, the random activation functions are associated with unavoidable, fabrication related waveguide imperfections that can act as hardware signatures. Numerical results reveal a probability of cloning as low as 10e-15, which corresponds to a highly secure authentication token.         ",

Here, we transcend this conventional framework and report, for the first time, spatiotemporal topological phase transition in photonic spacetime crystals - structures that are periodically modulated in both space and time. Using a dynamically modulated transmission line metamaterial, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate complete spatiotemporal topological phase transitions characterized by the closing and reopening of both energy and momentum band gaps, alongside changes in spatiotemporal topological invariants and topological phases. Furthermore, in a genuine photonic spacetime crystal that possesses a complete energy-momentum band gap, we directly observe a space-time topological event that localizes in both space and time, exhibiting relativistic-causality-governed excitation and robustness against spatiotemporal disorders. Our findings reveal the interplay among space, time, and topology, establishing a unified framework that provides a comprehensive picture of the emerging topological space-time physics and opening new avenues for robust spatiotemporal topological wave manipulations.

    "abstract": "           The miniaturization of self-referencing frequency comb systems enables emerging applications in metrology and spectroscopy. One major challenge in realizing the chip-scale self-referencing function is to generate octave-spanning soliton microcombs with low operation power. Accessing soliton states is also not trivial due to the thermal effect. Though an auxiliary laser was utilized to compensate for the thermal effect, deterministic single soliton generation is still elusive, especially for broadband operation. In this work, dispersion management is performed for a 4H-silicon carbide-on-insulator (SiCOI) multi-mode microring resonator, benefiting from the submicron-confinement waveguide layout. The fundamental transverse electric (TE) mode is engineered to anomalous dispersion for two dispersive waves generation over an octave span. While a higher order TE mode is engineered to normal dispersion to accommodate the auxiliary light for thermal compensation. The normal dispersion prevents modulation-instability Kerr comb generation, allowing for a large soliton existence range. We achieve microring resonators with Q up to 5.8 million and sub-milli-watt-threshold Kerr comb generation. Combining the dispersion-managed design and high Q device, we demonstrate the deterministic generation of a single soliton comb spanning beyond an octave with a low on-chip power of 60 mW. Our demonstration paves the way to realize chip-scale, turn-key, self-referenced frequency combs.         ",

In this situation, the measured time-frequency response deviates from a simple time-dependent linear response. When full two-dimensional time-frequency maps are measured, this yields complex features that can be incorrectly assigned to a photoexcited coherent response. We investigate this experimentally via the measured response of photoexcited SnSe, whereby photoinduced phase change dynamics lead to ultrafast changes of the charge carrier and lattice optical conductivity response. Two-dimensional time-frequency THz transmission maps subsequently show unexpected time-frequency features at early pump-probe delay times. These features are reproduced in both finite-difference time-domain simulations of the THz experiment and in an extension of non-equilibrium response function theory, demonstrating their systematic origin.

    "abstract": "           Designed to provide quality assurance for ion-beam radiotherapy, the prototype fIVI (filtered Interaction Vertex Imaging) Range Monitoring System is a two-layer tracker which employs double-sided strip-segmented silicon detectors. To meet the high demands of a clinical environment, a large sensitive area is required, along with a fast and compact readout. As this device utilizes sensors and readout electronics adapted from particle physics, where the expected energy and count rate differ significantly from radiotherapy, validation was necessary to ensure that these sensors would function effectively at the order 100 MeV/u energies and order MHz count rates expected during clinical irradiation. Tests were conducted using scattered subclinical 19 MeV protons at high intensity, and clinical 207 MeV/u carbon ions at low intensity to independently validate these variables. The detection system is found to operate at rates up to 1.3 MHz, with a negligible fraction of events being affected by pileup. The efficiency of hit reconstruction is high, with a timestamp resolution of 6.25 ns, and a coincidence window of 31.25 ns, as is required for clinical event rates. With these settings, over 90% of particle interactions are able to reconstruct unique hit positions and contribute to track formation. This device is the first system using large-area, high-resolution detectors which meets the demanding count rate requirements associated with clinical radiotherapy.         ",

Furthermore, we exploit this formalism to express the post-pump optical conductivity and consequently the Kerr rotation in terms of the time-evolved single-particle density matrix (SPDM), providing a transparent and computationally efficient description of photo-excited multi-band systems. This extension, in addition to its lower computational cost, has the advantage of allowing the inclusion of phenomenological damping. We illustrate the formalism using both (i) a two-band tight-binding model, which captures the essential physics of ultrafast spin-charge dynamics and the Kerr rotation, and (ii) weakly spin-polarized germanium, as a realistic playground with a complex band structure. The results demonstrate that, by exploiting DPOA and/or its SPDM extension, one can reliably reproduce both the short-time features under the pump-pulse envelope and the long-time dynamics after excitation, offering a versatile framework for analyzing time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect experiments in complex materials. Moreover, this analysis clearly shows that the Kerr rotation can be used to deduce experimentally the relevant n-photon resonances for a given specific material.         ",

Here, we show a simple, scalable oxygen-plasma process that reproducibly creates oxygen-related single quantum emitters in hBN with blinking-free zero-phonon lines spanning the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum from 700-960 nanometers. These emitters demonstrate room-temperature operation, high brightness, and ultra-sharp cryogenic linewidths in the few-gigahertz range under non-resonant excitation. Analysis of the PSBs shows weak electron-phonon coupling and predominant zero-phonon-line emission, while first-principles calculations identify plausible oxygen-related defect configurations.

    "abstract": "           Quantum tunnelling, a hallmark phenomenon of quantum mechanics, allows particles to pass through the classically forbidden region. It underpins fundamental processes ranging from nuclear fusion and photosynthesis to the operation of superconducting qubits. Yet the underlying dynamics of particle motion during tunnelling remain subtle and are still the subject of active debate. Here, by analyzing the temporal evolution of the tunnelling process, we show that the particle velocity inside the barrier continuously relaxes from a large initial value toward a smaller one, and may even approach zero in the evanescent regime. Meanwhile, the probability density within the barrier gradually builds up before reaching its stationary profile, in contrast to existing inherently. In addition, starting from the steady-state equations, we derive an explicit relation between the particle velocity and the barrier width, and show that the velocity in evanescent states approaches zero when the barrier is sufficiently wide. These findings resolve the apparent paradox of a vanishing steady-state velocity coexisting with a finite particle density. We point out that defining an effective speed from the probability density, rather than from the probability current, can lead to spuriously nonzero \"stationary speed,\" as appears to be the case in Ref. [Nature 643, 67 (2025)]. Our work establishes a clear dynamical picture for the formation of tunnelling flow and provides a theoretical foundation for testing time-resolved tunnelling phenomena.         ",

The study evaluates two models: the first employs logistic regression, which outperformed neural networks, decision trees, and the naive Bayes method, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying fault-related patterns. The second model leverages clustering and achieves superior performance in terms of precision and data segmentation. The results indicate that clustering may better capture the underlying data characteristics compared to supervised methods. The proposed methodology offers a new approach to early fault detection in wind turbine blades, highlighting the potential of integrating different computational learning techniques to enhance system reliability. The use of accessible tools like Orange Data Mining underscores the practical application of these advanced solutions within the wind energy sector. Future work will focus on combining these methods to improve detection accuracy further and extend the application of these techniques to other critical components in energy infrastructure.

This result forms the basis for a rigorous, self-consistent procedure for the quantization of broadband guided electromagnetic fields in the typical channels used in integrated photonic circuits. Our work removes the existing theoretical gap between the classical solution of the Maxwell equations for guided fields and the intuitive understanding of photons in waveguides.

    "abstract": "           PL5 and PL6 centers in 4H-SiC are promising for quantum applications due to their superior charge stability and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties at room temperature. However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing controversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults. Previous measurements relying on spin ensemble detection were insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In this work, we conduct correlative imaging of stacking faults and PL5/PL6 at the single-defect level, definitively ruling out any spatial correlation and demonstrating that these centers are not associated with stacking faults. Furthermore, we find that substituting oxygen for nitrogen in ion implantation enhances the yields of PL5 and PL6 by more than $11$-fold and $23$-fold, respectively. Single-spin ODMR spectroscopy of PL5 reveals six distinct orientations, determines the transverse zero-field splitting parameter $E$, and characterizes the hyperfine coupling. Combined with our ab initio calculations, these results provide compelling evidence for the assignment of PL5 as an OV($kh$) defect, consisting of an oxygen atom occupying the C($k$) site as the nearest neighbor to a Si($h$) vacancy. The structural analysis together with the demonstrated defect yield enhancement lays the foundation for fabricating high-sensitivity, high-contrast ensemble quantum sensors in two and three dimensions.

Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian are linked to the entanglement growth and signal the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. We also point out that the static quantum Fisher information exhibits a non-perturbative behavior in the zero-coupling limit, which we justify with an analytic argument. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point, remaining robust under pure dephasing noise. Non-monotonic signatures of the quantum Fisher information matrix reflect changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.

    "abstract": "           Simulating open quantum systems is key to understanding non-equilibrium processes, as persistent influence from the environment induces dissipation and can give rise to steady-state phase transitions. A common strategy is to embed the system-environment into a larger unitary framework, but this obscures the intrinsic complexity of the reduced system dynamics. Here, we investigate the computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems, focusing on two physically relevant parameters -- correlation length and mixing time -- and explore whether it can be comparable (or even lower) to that of simulating their closed counterparts. In particular, we study the role of dissipation in simulating open-system dynamics using both quantum and classical methods, where the classical complexity is characterised by the bond dimension and operator entanglement entropy. Our results show that dissipation affects correlation length and mixing time in distinct ways at intermediate and long timescales. Moreover, we observe numerically that in classical tensor network simulations, classical complexity does not decrease with stronger dissipation, revealing a separation between quantum and classical resource scaling.

    "title": "Multiphase transport and compositional mixing mechanisms in twin-wire laser directed energy deposition: toward process stability and graded material fabrication",
    "abstract": "           Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.
