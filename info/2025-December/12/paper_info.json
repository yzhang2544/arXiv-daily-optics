    "abstract": "           We investigate the nonlinear propagation of light in graded-index multimode fiber, utilizing it as an optical computing unit, and quantify how it employs waveguide modes to process information. Using a time-dependent spatiotemporal propagation model with modal decomposition, we evaluate several benchmark regression and classification tasks and study the modal content of the generated speckles, which couples with a simple digital layer to perform optical computing. Analysis of modal entropy and energy-based mode counts reveals that effective computation is confined to a low-dimensional modal subspace, whose identity depends on the task and propagation regime. This also sets a trade-off between modal richness and nonlinear beam self-cleaning. These results establish modal statistics as practical design metrics for fiber-based optical computers.         ",

    "abstract": "           The generation of white optical vortices is currently constrained by intrinsic trade-offs between spectral bandwidth, conversion efficiency, and temporal pulse integrity in conventional diffractive and geometric-phase approaches. In this work, we theoretically investigate a compensated tandem crossed twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal architecture that overcomes these fundamental limitations. By developing a rigorous Jones matrix model and defining specific figures of merit for chromatic fidelity, we analyze the impact of manufacturing imperfections and non-adiabatic waveguiding (deviations from the Mauguin regime) on the device performance. We propose and evaluate three distinct compensation strategies, ranging from optimized passive designs for specific manufacturing tolerances to a robust active compensation scheme utilizing a tunable retarder. Our analysis demonstrates that the active approach effectively nullifies parasitic amplitude modulation, enabling the generation of perfectly achromatic vortices with high phase purity across an arbitrary bandwidth. This establishes the compensated tandem TN cell as a superior and versatile platform for high-fidelity white-light singular optics.         ",

Achieving improved noise performance requires a physical understanding of the noise mechanisms. Here, we experimentally test a theoretical proposal for drain (output) noise as originating in part from real-space transfer (RST) by characterizing the microwave noise temperature of transfer-length method structures with the same channel composition but two different barrier compositions. This choice was made to alter the confining potential of electrons in the channel, thereby affecting the RST mechanism, while avoiding changes to the channel transport properties. We observe trends of noise temperature with physical temperature and source-drain voltage which are compatible with the predictions of RST noise theory. This finding supports the hypothesis that RST contributes to drain noise in HEMTs.         ",

    "abstract": "           Inverse medium scattering is an ill-posed, nonlinear wave-based imaging problem arising in medical imaging, remote sensing, and non-destructive testing. Machine learning (ML) methods offer increased inference speed and flexibility in capturing prior knowledge of imaging targets relative to classical optimization-based approaches; however, they perform poorly in regimes where the scattering behavior is highly nonlinear. A key limitation is that ML methods struggle to incorporate the physics governing the scattering process, which are typically inferred implicitly from the training data or loosely enforced via architectural design. In this paper, we present a method that endows a machine learning framework with explicit knowledge of problem physics, in the form of a differentiable solver representing the forward model. The proposed method progressively refines reconstructions of the scattering potential using measurements at increasing wave frequencies, following a classical strategy to stabilize recovery. Empirically, we find that our method provides high-quality reconstructions at a fraction of the computational or sampling costs of competing approaches.         ",

Motivated by recent theoretical work suggesting that self-interacting ultralight axions can be captured by the Sun's gravitational field and thermalize into the ground state, we develop a signal model for the pseudo-magnetic fields generated by axion-proton gradient couplings in such a halo. The analysis focuses on the fifth GNOME Science Run (69 days, 12 stations), employing a cross-correlation pipeline with time-shifted daily modulation templates to search for the global, direction-dependent, monochromatic signal expected from a solar axion halo. No statistically significant candidate signals are observed. We set 95% confidence-level upper limits on the amplitude of the axion-induced pseudo-magnetic field over the frequency range 0.05 Hz to 20 Hz, translating to constraints on the linear and quadratic axion-proton couplings for halo densities predicted by gravitational capture models and for the maximum overdensities allowed by planetary ephemerides. In the quadratic coupling case, our limits surpass existing astrophysical bounds by over two orders of magnitude across much of the accessible parameter space.         ",

Nevertheless, the practical implementation of Kerr nonlinearity in waveguides has been constrained by the material's inherently low third-order nonlinear coefficients. Here, we present a significant advancement by demonstrating Pockels effect-induced strong Kerr nonlinearity in a periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate waveguide. Both effective four-wave mixing (FWM) and cascaded effective FWM processes are experimentally observed. The induced FWM process achieves a remarkable maximum output power of -8.5 dBm, spanning a wavelength spectrum of over 116.8 nm. Analysis reveals that the induced effective Kerr nonlinearity exhibits a substantial effective nonlinear refractive index as $2.9\\times 10^{-15} m^{2}W^{-1}$, corresponding to an effective nonlinear refractive index enhancement factor of $1.6\\times 10^{4}$ relative to the intrinsic value. Moreover, a wavelength-converting experiment demonstrates a flat optic-to-optic response over a broadband radiofrequency spectrum, confirming that signal integrity is well preserved after on-chip effective FWM conversion. Therefore, the demonstrated efficient and broadband Pockels effect induced effective Kerr nonlinearity paves the way for novel applications in diverse fields, including spectroscopy, parametric amplification, quantum correlation studies, and wavelength conversion technologies.

Here, we introduce a versatile time delayed DPRC framework that natively supports deep and concurrent spatiotemporal processing entirely in the optical domain. At its core, the system leverages free carrier dynamics in silicon microring resonators to provide the fundamental nonlinearity and short term memory, and these nonlinear nodes are interconnected through true time delay lines that establish shared long-term memory. Benefiting from intrinsic physical nonlinearity and multi-timescale fading memory, this simple yet effective architecture demonstrates remarkable high dimensional representation capabilities. On the NTU RGB D benchmark, the parameter efficient DPRC system achieves superior action recognition accuracies compared to mainstream deep learning models, while requiring only a single shot regression training procedure. We further verify a prototype DPRC chip that excels across diverse dataset classification and time series prediction tasks. It enables a streamlined all optical pipeline between hierarchical layers, delivering a consistent computational density of 334.25 TOPs/mm2, independent of the reservoir depth and three orders of magnitude higher than conventional approaches. Moreover, its performance scales with near-zero hardware overhead by utilizing additional wavelength channels. This DPRC network is highly scalable on a silicon photonic platform, with flexible extension to hundreds of deep reservoir layers and parallel channels, paving the way toward intelligent optoelectronic systems for advanced real time processing and parallel decision making.

The optimization identifies the maximum electron energy that a self-guided laser wakefield accelerator, driven by a laser of a given energy, can produce, together with the corresponding acceleration distance. Our results further demonstrate that electrons with energies close to the maximum value can be obtained across a relatively wide range of input parameters and without the need for their precise tuning.

    "abstract": "           Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at the single-molecule level with atomic resolution holds transformative potential for structural biology and surface chemistry. Near-surface solid-state spin sensors with optical readout ability offer a promising pathway toward this goal. However, their extreme proximity to target molecules demands exceptional robustness against surface-induced perturbations. Furthermore, life science applications require these sensors to operate in biocompatible spectral ranges that minimize photodamage. In this work, we demonstrate that the PL6 quantum defect in 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) can serve as a robust near-infrared spin sensor. This sensor operates at tissue-transparent wavelengths and exhibits exceptional near-surface stability even at depth of 2 nm. Using shallow PL6 centers, we achieve nanoscale NMR detection of proton ($\\mathrm{^{1}H}$) spins in immersion oil and fluorine ($\\mathrm{^{19}F}$) spins in Fomblin, attaining a detection volume of $\\mathrm{(3~nm)^3}$ and a sensitivity reaching the requirement for single-proton spin detection. This work establishes 4H-SiC quantum sensors as a compelling platform for nanoscale magnetic resonance, with promising applications in probing low-dimensional water phases, protein folding dynamics, and molecular interactions.

We demonstrate phase-only digital holography to implement the optimal subsets and show that residual aberrations add less than 1 dB of sensitivity loss.

Its all-photonic version - mediated by the interference of photon pairs generated by separate quantum systems-finds disparate applications in quantum networks. So far, all-photonic entanglement swapping between remote systems has been implemented only using sources that operate probabilistically. However, the scaling up of quantum networks requires deterministic quantum emitters that do not suffer from a trade-off between degree of entanglement and photonpair generation rate. Here, we demonstrate all-photonic entanglement swapping using photon-pairs generated by two separate GaAs quantum dots. The emitters are deterministically embedded in hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric devices that make the entangled-photons from two dissimilar quantum dots nearly identical. Entanglement swapping is demonstrated with a fidelity as high as 0.71(2), more than 10 standard deviations above the classical limit. The experimental data are quantitatively explained by a theoretical model that also suggests how to boost the protocol performances.

Additionally, remote control of bosonic modes over a transmission distance of 15 km has been achieved, with fidelities exceeding 95%.

Most studies to date, however, implicitly invoke the scalar approximation, which is not appropriate in the context of high-numerical-aperture microscopy. Utilizing parameter estimation theory, here we consider the estimation of separation between two closely spaced dipole emitters, a commonly employed model for single-molecule optical beacons. We consider two limiting cases: one in which the orientations of the emitters are fixed and equal, and another in which both dipoles freely sample all of orientation space over the course of the measurement. We quantify precision limits using quantum and classical variants of the Fisher information and Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound. In all cases, the vectorial nature of the emission complicates the analyses, but with appropriate filtering of the collected light in the azimuthal-radial polarization basis, a previously proposed scheme to saturate the quantum Fisher information via image inversion interferometry can be salvaged.

In addition to the primary comb that propagates along with the pump, Rayleigh scattering creates a comb that travels in the opposite direction. Normally, the scattering is a very weak, however, in the high-quality-factor MRR the power transferred to the backward-propagating comb can be quite significant. We demonstrate that the backward-propagating comb can be used as a feedback source for a fiber laser, effectively creating a nonlinear mirror for the laser cavity. By assembling a simple laser cavity comprising only active fiber and two mirrors, one of which is an integrated MRR, we show a robust self-starting comb generation with width exceeding 500 nm. We confirm the universal character of this approach for other types of microresonators, including whispering gallery mode resonators, by launching self-starting laser cavity combs with the crystalline toroidal cavity, coupled with a tapered fiber. This method provides significant simplification for the filter-driven laser cavity soliton generation, especially when free-space coupling is applied.         ",

While these response functions are almost always computed within a Born-Oppenheimer (BO) framework, here we provide a natural interpretation of the electric-dipole magnetic-dipole polarizability within phase space electronic structure theory, a beyond-BO model whereby the electronic structure depends on nuclear momentum (P) in addition to nuclear position (R).

At first sight, this suggests that, when determining the response of such a plasma to a static, externally generated, resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP), it is necessary to include an infinite number of rational magnetic flux-surfaces in the calculation, the majority of which lie very close to the separatrix. In fact, when finite plasma resistivity is taken into account, this turns out not to be the case. Instead, it is only necessary to include rational surfaces that lie in the region 0<Psi<Psi_c, where Psi is the normalized poloidal magnetic flux, and Psi_c<1 can be calculated from the edge plasma parameters.

Quantum computing offers promising potential for calculating PESs that are intractable for classical computers. However, its realistic application poses significant challenges to the development of quantum algorithms that are sufficiently general to enable efficient and precise PES calculations across chemical systems with diverse properties, as well as to seamlessly adapt existing NAMD theories to quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a quantum-adapted extension to the Landau-Zener-Surface-Hopping (LZSH) NAMD. This extension incorporates curvature-driven hopping corrections that protect the population evolution while maintaining the efficiency gained from avoiding the computation of non-adiabatic couplings (NACs), as well as preserving the trajectory independence that enables parallelization. Furthermore, to ensure the high-precision PESs required for surface hopping dynamics, we develop a sub-microhartree-accurate PES calculation protocol. This protocol supports active space selection, enables parallel acceleration either on quantum or classical clusters, and demonstrates adaptability to diverse chemical systems - including the charged H3+ ion and the C2H4 molecule, a prototypical multi-reference benchmark.

By applying external RF signals with varying frequency and power, we identified the locking behavior of individual modes and extracted the total locking ranges from spectral measurements. The results show asymmetric evolution of the lower and upper locking boundaries with drive power for the lower-frequency SWARO modes, while the highest-frequency mode exhibits nearly symmetric behavior. A maximum locking range of over 11 MHz is observed at a drive power of -10 dBm. To interpret these results, we develop an Adler-like model that captures the dependence of the locking range on drive power, showing good agreement for the higher-frequency modes. For the lowest-frequency mode, however, the model underestimates the locking range at low drive and saturates at high drive power levels, while the experimental range increases monotonically, indicating the influence of multi-mode interactions. These findings establish SWARO as a useful platform for exploring injection phenomena in spin-wave ring systems with delayed feedback and motivate the development of extended injection models that account for multi-mode dynamics.

By introducing an appropriate change of variable, the correction term is reduced to a single integral that can be evaluated in closed form in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions. The resulting expression compactly incorporates both dimensionality and stiffness, providing direct access to the low- and high-temperature asymptotic regimes. In the special case of the standard Lennard-Jones fluid ($d=3$, $n=6$), the formula obtained is considerably more compact than previously reported representations based on hypergeometric functions. The knowledge of this correction allows us to determine the first quantum contribution to the Boyle temperature, whose dependence on dimensionality and stiffness is explicitly analyzed, and enables quantitative assessment of quantum effects in noble gases such as helium, neon, and argon.
