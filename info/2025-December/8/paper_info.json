    "abstract": "           We present a unified quantum open system framework for lossy plasmonic cavities in which coherent dynamics, relaxation, dephasing, and irreversible absorption are treated on equal footing. The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering.

The optical path extends nearly two meters, spanning the full length of the cryostat insert, enabling excitation of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers and detection of the resulting fluorescence from outside the cryostat. The setup preserves optical alignment and beam quality along this extended path allowing integration into existing cryogenic systems without significant modifications. We demonstrate the setup's performance by measuring the temperature dependence of the resonance signal and its behavior under small applied magnetic fields, as well as the magnetic transition of a SrRuO$_3$ sample, thereby showcasing the feasibility of NV magnetometry on a sample in constrained cryogenic environments.

    "abstract": "           Simultaneous readout of large-scale cryogenic detector arrays relies on multiplexing schemes such as the FDM (Frequency-Division Multiplexing) with microwave SQUID multiplexers and highly customized readout electronics. In traditional detector systems, where mixed-signal ASICs are used in detector front-ends and typically provide a digital interface, HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) testing can be readily implemented by reusing the existing digital logic of the front-end for emulation purposes. Such straightforward emulation is not possible for FDM low-temperature detectors, where the sensor signal is encoded in a high-frequency microwave carrier via a two-stage modulation scheme depending on the cryogenic resonators and the SQUID response. To address this challenge, we present CryoDE, a digital cryogenic-detector emulator for microwave SQUID multiplexed detector systems. CryoDE generates the encoded detector signals, including realistic pulse responses, enabling full HIL testing of the room-temperature DAQ system without requiring the cryogenic hardware. This resource-efficient FPGA-based detector twin integrates seamlessly into existing DAQ systems and allows experiment-specific adjustment of detector-signal parameters. We describe the internal architecture and capabilities of CryoDE within our custom HIL framework and demonstrate its use in evaluating the performance of real-time signal processing firmware optimized for different microwave SQUID multiplexed cryogenic-detector experiments.

Traditional pulse characterization techniques rely on nonlinear optical processes that require high peak powers, making them unsuitable for the attojoule-to-femtojoule regime relevant to quantum photonics. Our approach utilizes a wavelength-to-time mapping method in which the arrival times of spectrally filtered components of a broadband pulse are recorded using a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector and correlated via a high-resolution time-tagging system. The resulting linear relationship between wavelength and arrival time directly yields the dispersion parameter and, subsequently, the GDD. Beyond single-emitter excitation, this technique can be applied in areas such as single-photon spectroscopy, ultralow-power optical communications, and time-domain quantum control, where linear and non-destructive dispersion characterization is essential.

    "abstract": "           Nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) arising from the light mass of hydrogen can influence the structure and stability of hydrogen-bonded biomolecules, yet their role in determining peptide and protein folding remains unclear. Experiments show that substituting H$_2$O with D$_2$O often stabilizes folded states, but the microscopic mechanism associated with this phenomena remains unresolved. Through ab initio-level path-integral molecular dynamics simulations enabled by machine-learning interatomic potentials, we address the fundamental question of the role of NQEs in peptides by investigating both their overall impact and isotope substitution effects. Overall, NQEs systematically destabilize compact three-dimensional structures across peptide systems, independent of secondary structure type or side-chain interactions. Contrary to the conventional picture that places central importance on hydrogen bonds, we find that the dominant destabilization instead arises from the quantum C-H vibrations. In addition, we reveal microscopic insights into the stabilization of folded peptides upon H$_2$O to D$_2$O substitution, showing that the H/D isotope substitution of active peptide hydrogens, previously considered unimportant, produces free-energy changes within the range of experimentally observed shifts. These findings provide a new interpretation of isotope effects in biological systems, indicating that seemingly small H$\\to$D substitutions within peptides can be as important as, or even outweigh, solvent contributions.

The discussion that followed has emphasized a basic point: writing down coordinate maps is not the same thing as providing a physical theory. In particular, quantum superposition is not operationally defined by drawing multiple paths on paper: it is defined by what happens when alternatives recombine in an interference loop [2, 3]. In parallel, careful 1+1 analyses have clarified how sign conventions and time-orientation choices enter the superluminal formulas [4]. Finally, tachyonic QFT proposals suggest a possible mathematical bridge via an enlarged (twin) Hilbert space [5], although this proposal remains contested (e.g., on commutator covariance and microcausality grounds) [6]. The aim of this short note is organizational. We keep three layers separate: (K) kinematics (which maps exist and what they preserve), (O) operational content (what an experiment must actually reproduce, especially closed-loop interference), and (D/B) dynamics and bridges (how amplitudes and probabilities are generated, and how subluminal and superluminal sectors might be linked). The goal is not relativity derives quantum theory, but a clear checklist of what must be added for that ambition to become a well-posed programme.         ",

The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms.

We propose ZRNet, a physics-informed framework that jointly performs Zernike coefficient prediction and optical image Restoration. We contribute a Zernike Graph module that explicitly models physical relationships between Zernike polynomials based on their azimuthal degrees-ensuring that learned corrections align with fundamental optical principles. To further enforce physical consistency between image restoration and Zernike prediction, we introduce a Frequency-Aware Alignment (FAA) loss, which better aligns Zernike coefficient prediction and image features in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on CytoImageNet demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both image restoration and Zernike coefficient prediction across diverse microscopy modalities and biological samples with complex, large-amplitude aberrations.

The ground-state electronic wavefunctions and energies are obtained using the quantum annealer eignsolver algorithm. This work provides a pathway for the computation of molecular properties in the quantum annealing paradigm.         ",
