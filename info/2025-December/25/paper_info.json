This approach eliminates the back-scattering and waveguide loss arising from sidewall roughness in single mode waveguides, reduces sensitivity to small dimensional variations, and reduces light induced self-heating. Although the detailed behavior of TIR at curved waveguide side wall mirror is too complex to capture by simple models, the experimental results are found to be in qualitative agreement with simple analytical calculations based on Gaussian beam theory and effective index approximations.

While matter ranges widely from atoms, particles, to solids, photons are predominantly in a confined physical space, such as a pair of mirrors, for enhanced photon-matter interactions known as cavity QED. Since position and momentum are canonically conjugate variables governed by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, a fundamental question arises - what if light confinement is in the not-so-intuitive momentum or reciprocal space? The realization of photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) has made possible this exotic scenario. Here, we summarize the most recent advancements at this research frontier in optics and photonics, covering weak coupling, strong coupling, and nonlinear optics. We can designate such photon-matter interactions enabled by reciprocal light confinement through BICs with truly open systems as reciprocal QED, which holds great promise to comprehend and extend cavity QED for optics, photonics, and related fields.

    "abstract": "           Magnetocardiography system is a medical device that diagnoses cardiac disease by measuring magnetic fields generated from electric currents flowing through the myocardium. However, the accuracy of measurement data can be degraded if strong magnetic materials are present or magnetic field changes occur near the MCG system. With the widespread use of implants, the number of patients with metallic implants is increasing, but there is a lack of in-depth research on the potential impact of implant materials on the results of the MCG examination. This study aims to analyze the effect of implant materials on MCG measurements and establish relevant criteria. In this study, a 96-channel MCG system employing Superconducting Quantum Interference Device sensors, specifically first-order gradiometers based on the Double Relaxation Oscillation SQUID method, and a Magnetically Shielded Room were utilized. Ti6Al4V ELI was selected as the representative implant material sample. Experiments were conducted under extreme conditions, where a sample significantly larger than an actual implant was placed as close as possible to the sensors. As a result, when the implant material was at the minimum distance to the sensor, the noise increase was approximately 0.7 fT/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$, which satisfies the sensitivity criteria for MCG. Furthermore, since these results were obtained under severely adverse conditions designed to maximize the noise impact, it is anticipated that the effect would be even more negligible in actual clinical settings. In conclusion, it was confirmed that common implant materials have little to no effect on MCG measurements. However, as the experiments were not conducted with the material inserted into the human body, unlike actual clinical environments, the generation of magnetic fields due to micromotion has not been verified, thus requiring further experimentation.

In this work, we present a practical method to extract dielectric properties of STE multilayers using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). By comparing the THz pulse calculated using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) with the experimentally measured pulse transmitted through the sample, we can extract the dielectric properties of STEs, enhancing THz-TDS analysis and facilitating STE design and optimization.

In contrast to the predominantly thermorefractive noise in silicon photonic platforms, TCCR noise represents a distinct mechanism that becomes critical for applications requiring high frequency stability and phase coherence, including optomechanical sensing, low-phase-noise microwave synthesis, and on-chip quantum squeezing. A quantitative understanding of the deterministic parameters that control TCCR noise is therefore essential for engineering the next generation of low-noise TFLN photonic systems. Here, we identify two dominant contributors to the TCCR noise in TFLN microresonators: material anisotropy and surface states. Material anisotropy results in increased noise for extraordinarily polarized optical modes and leads to a geometry dependent phase noise. Surface-state effects manifest as increased noise in higher-order transverse modes as well as more than 120-fold higher noise in suspended microresonators. Finally, we demonstrate that post-fabrication annealing -- widely used to reduce defect densities and recover crystal quality -- suppresses frequency noise by a factor of 8.2 in cladded microresonators. Together, these results establish a practical pathway for noise engineering in TFLN integrated photonic devices and accelerate their deployment in next-generation precision photonic systems.

To strike a balance between ansatz complexity and computational stability in VQE calculations, we propose the HiUCCSD, a novel symmetry-respecting ansatz engineered from the intrinsic information of the Hamiltonian. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of HiUCCSD within the scope of Abelian point groups. Furthermore, we compare the performance of HiUCCSD and the established SymUCCSD via VQE and Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter (ADAPT)-VQE numerical experiments on ten molecules with distinct point groups. The results show that HiUCCSD achieves equivalent performance to SymUCCSD for Abelian point group molecules, while avoiding the potential performance failure of SymUCCSD in the case of non-Abelian point group molecules. Across the studied molecular systems, HiUCCSD cuts the parameter count by 18%-83% for VQE and reduces the excitation operator pool size by 27%-84% for ADAPT-VQE, as compared with the UCCSD ansatz. With enhanced robustness and broader applicability, HiUCCSD offers a new ansatz option for advancing large-scale molecular VQE implementation.         ",

    "abstract": "           Classical background electromagnetic fields are routinely employed in quantum electrodynamics to describe a wide range of physical situations, from laser-matter interactions to strong-field phenomena. In this work, we present a first-principles formulation that clarifies the quantum origin of such classical background fields in QED by systematically deriving them from coherent states of the electromagnetic field. Abstract Starting from the operator formulation of QED, we show how scattering amplitudes between coherent states naturally lead to an effective description in terms of background fields, while maintaining a clear separation between the coherent laser mode and other quantized photon degrees of freedom. This framework allows one to consistently incorporate effects beyond the fixed background approximation, such as depletion and backreaction, without assuming any particular field strength or intensity regime. Abstract We further demonstrate how the conventional generating functional with a prescribed background field emerges as a limiting case, corresponding to fixed coherent state boundary conditions. The path integral representation is then obtained as a reformulation of the same underlying Heisenberg picture amplitudes, providing a unified view of operator-based and functional approaches. Abstract Our results establish a general and intensity-independent foundation for QED with coherent background fields, within which the standard formulations of strong-field QED arise as well-defined special cases.

One-port, loop-coupled S11 measurements supported by full-wave simulations reveal twist-driven hybridization of the dominant resonant manifold. For small G, the lower hybrid resonance redshifts continuously from 409 MHz to 210 MHz (2:1 tuning), enabling compact, twist-programmable resonant surfaces. Simulations further show that twisting imprints moire-like magnetic near-field super-modulations. From resonance frequencies, linewidths, and normal-mode splitting extracted from the complex response, we obtain normalized coupling up to g = 0.43 with cooperativity exceeding unity over broad angular ranges, meeting the resolved-splitting criterion.

These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems.

As a leading platform, neutral atom arrays rely on atomic fluorescence imaging for qubit readout, requiring short exposure, low photon count schemes to mitigate heating and atom loss while enabling mid-circuit feedback. However, a fundamental challenge arises in the single-photon regime where severe overlap in state distributions causes conventional threshold discrimination to fail. Here, we report an AI-accelerated Bayesian inference method for fluorescence readout in neutral atom arrays. Our approach leverages Bayesian inference to achieve reliable state detection at the single-photon level under short exposure. Specifically, we introduce a weakly anchored Bayesian scheme that requires calibration of only one state, addressing asymmetric calibration challenges common across quantum platforms. Furthermore, acceleration is achieved via a permutation-invariant neural network, which yields a 100-fold speedup by compressing iterative inference into a single forward pass. The approach achieves relative readout fidelity above 99% and 98% for histogram overlaps of 61% and 72%, respectively, enabling reliable extraction of Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference results unattainable with conventional threshold based methods.

We present quantum mechanical $j_z$-conserving coupled-states calculations of state-resolved cross sections for H/D--CO$_2$ collisions at energies up to 5~eV, benchmarked to within 7\\% of close-coupling results. Scattering is strongly forward-peaked, yielding momentum-transfer cross sections substantially smaller than commonly assumed: mass-scaling from O/C--CO$_2$ systems overestimates H--CO$_2$ total cross sections by factors of 30--45, while existing empirical fits underestimate the low-energy regime by up to $\\sim$45\\%. Isotopic substitution (H/D) produces energy-dependent differences of up to 35\\% at $E<0.1$~eV, invalidating uniform scaling approaches for D/H fractionation. Maxwellian-averaged rate coefficients derived from our cross sections are significantly smaller than mass-scaled values, implying reduced H--CO$_2$ energy transfer efficiency. In atmospheric escape modelling, these revisions can shift Martian exobase altitudes by 10--20~km, leading to order-unity changes in thermal escape rates, and have implications for hydrogen loss in early CO$_2$-dominated planetary atmospheres. Our results provide essential quantum-mechanical inputs for revisiting atmospheric evolution scenarios on Mars, early Earth, and CO$_2$-rich exoplanets.         ",

    "abstract": "           Owing to minimal aberration, larger field-of-view, and high resolution, monocentric lenses are preferred over other imagers in hemispherical image surface scenarios, particularly in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) region. Herein, we study a monocentric lens assembly consisting of a ball lens and two hemispherical shell lenses of given radii of curvature and lens materials to enhance the transmission of LWIR ranging from 8{\\mu}m to 12{\\mu}m wavelength. We optimize the air gaps between the lenses of the assembly for a wider range of incidence angles, assuming antireflecting coating (ARC) on all surfaces of the lenses. Additionally, the effect of temperature variation on the transmittance is also studied to attain an optimum air gap between the lenses. With the variation in incidence angle and temperature, modulations in focal length and spot size are reported for different wavelengths. Further, we propose a metasurface design to replace conventional multilayer ARCs to enhance the transmittance through the lens assembly over the given wavelength range for a wide field-of-view.

    "abstract": "           We compare two methods for evaluating the cardinality of the Cartesian product $N \\times N$ of the set of natural numbers $N$. The first is used to explain the thermodynamics of black body radiation by using convergent functions on $N \\times N$. The cardinality of $N \\times N$ enters through the partition function, internal energy and entropy for every macrostate given by a normal mode of electromagnetic wave. Here, $N \\times N$ is assigned a greater cardinality than $N$. The second method was devised in analysis to count the rational numbers by using divergent functions on $N \\times N$. Here, $N \\times N$ is not assigned a greater cardinality than $N$. In this article, we show that the experimentally confirmed first approach is mathematically more consistent with the definition of the real line and foundations of topology. It also provides a quantitative measure of the cardinality of $N \\times N$ relative to that of N. Similar arguments show that the set of rational numbers is not countable. This article suggests that the axiom of choice is a more rigorous technique to prove the existence theorems for connection and metric on the spacetime manifold than the usual application of second-countability.

    "abstract": "           Enhancing light-matter interactions depends critically on the ability to tailor photonic modes at subwavelength scales, and combining distinct resonant modes has shown remarkable potential unattainable by individual resonances alone. Despite recent advances in anapole metasurfaces for energy confinement and Fabry-Perot (FP) cavities for spectral control, their synergistic coupling and resulting opportunities remain largely unexplored due to challenges such as precise nanoscale assembly. Here, we demonstrate that embedding a terahertz (THz) anapole metasurface within a tunable FP cavity results in a hybrid cavity that demonstrates exotic properties as the anapole transitions between coupling to FP resonances and anti-resonances via cavity-length tuning. At room temperature, we observe ultrastrong coupling (> 30% of the anapole frequency) between anapoles and FP resonances, generating tunable-dispersion polaritons that blend favorable properties of both modes. Meanwhile, anapole spectrally aligns with FP anti-resonances, leading to weak coupling that narrows the linewidth of the anapole's transmission peak by two orders of magnitude and enhances its local density of states (LDOS) near the metasurface correspondingly. With exceptional capabilities including formation of polaritons and significant enhancement of LDOS, the hybrid cavity enables strong interaction with functional materials, paving the way for exploration of quantum optics, molecular sensing, and ultrafast nonlinear photonics.

    "abstract": "           Chiral responses in electromagnetic metasurfaces are typically categorized as extrinsic, resulting from asymmetric interactions between the structure and incident waves, and intrinsic, arising from three-dimensional symmetry breaking of the unit cell. However, most existing metasurface designs target only one type of chirality and lack a unified, continuously tunable platform for broader chiroptical control. To address this limitation, the designed kirigami-based flexible metasurface is proposed for dynamic, continuous modulation of chirality, which expands the control scope to both extrinsic and intrinsic chiral responses within a single, reconfigurable platform. Initially, the unfolded metasurface exhibits extrinsic chirality under oblique incidence. By introducing well-designed kirigami-based cuts and folds, the metasurface transitions from a planar and achiral configuration to a three-dimensional chiral geometry that breaks the mirror symmetry, thereby exhibiting tunable intrinsic chirality and asymmetric extrinsic chirality. As the folding angle increases, the resulting deformation enables continuous tuning of the chiral response, with circular dichroism and its asymmetry under oblique incidences progressively increasing and reaching pronounced levels across the X-band. Our work provides a lightweight, easy-fabricated, and mechanically reconfigurable metasurface, which offers strong potential for future development in adaptive photonic systems and advanced chiroptical technologies.

    "abstract": "           Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.

    "abstract": "           Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science. We discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. These resources can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\\Omega(\\log (t/\\epsilon))$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\\epsilon$, entanglement, magic, and coherence do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states by transforming $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit, $O(t [\\log t]^3 \\log n \\log(1/\\epsilon))$, is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in quantum information processing. As a concrete example, we propose classical shadow tomography using an estimator with superpositions between only two states, from which almost all quantum states can be efficiently certified by requiring only $O(1)$ measurements and classical post-processing time.
