    "abstract": "           A widely circulated infrared video from 2024 appears to show an air-to-surface missile engaging a small luminous \"orb\"-like object, producing debris and an apparent deflection of the missile's trajectory. This paper presents a comprehensive physics-based analysis of the event. Using classical mechanics, fluid dynamics, and imaging-system geometry, we examine momentum transfer, debris behavior, gimbal-induced optical distortions, and the physical plausibility of various interpretations. A balloon-like object remains the most conservative explanation compatible with known physics. However, modern physics is incomplete: the extreme weakness of gravity relative to the gauge forces, the existence of dark matter, dark energy, neutrino masses, and the possibility of extra spatial dimensions indicate that the Standard Model is not the final description of nature. For this reason, anomalous observations should not be dismissed outright as \"impossible\". Nevertheless, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the present video lacks the multi-sensor, verified, and calibrated data required to support exotic interpretations. The aim is a balanced scientific evaluation based on current knowledge while maintaining appropriate theoretical humility.         ",

    "title": "Universal Quantum Interconnects via Phase-Coherent Four-Wave Mixing",
    "abstract": "           Quantum transduction, which enables the coherent conversion of quantum information between disparate physical platforms, is a cornerstone for realizing scalable and interoperable quantum networks. Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (>99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks.

    "abstract": "           Detecting concealed chemicals and explosives remains a critical challenge in global security. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) offers a promising non-invasive and stand-off detection technique owing to its ability to penetrate optically opaque materials without causing ionization damage. While many chemicals exhibit distinct spectral features in the terahertz range, conventional terahertz-based detection methods often struggle in real-world environments, where variations in sample geometry, thickness, and packaging can lead to inconsistent spectral responses. In this study, we present a chemical imaging system that integrates THz-TDS with deep learning to enable accurate pixel-level identification and classification of different explosives. Operating in reflection mode and enhanced with plasmonic nanoantenna arrays, our THz-TDS system achieves a peak dynamic range of 96 dB and a detection bandwidth of 4.5 THz, supporting practical, stand-off operation. By analyzing individual time-domain pulses with deep neural networks, the system exhibits strong resilience to environmental variations and sample inconsistencies. Blind testing across eight chemicals, including pharmaceutical excipients and explosive compounds, resulted in an average classification accuracy of 99.42% at the pixel level. Notably, the system maintained an average accuracy of 88.83% when detecting explosives concealed under opaque paper coverings, demonstrating its robust generalization capability. These results highlight the potential of combining advanced terahertz spectroscopy with neural networks for highly sensitive and specific chemical and explosive detection in diverse and operationally relevant scenarios.

    "abstract": "           Array configuration is one of the effective ways to increase the output power of terahertz oscillators using resonant tunneling diodes. Mutual locking between the array elements results in coherent single-spectrum oscillation and a narrow radiation beam. However, frequency variation between elements disturbs the mutual locking. In this paper, the frequency variation that can be tolerated for mutual locking is approximately derived for an array with arbitrary coupling configuration. Using this result, the element-number dependence of the frequency variation tolerance for 1D and 2D arrays is calculated. In 1D arrays, the frequency variation tolerance decreases inversely proportional to the square root of the element number. In 2D arrays, as the number of columns is increased while keeping the number of elements per column constant, the frequency variation tolerance increases for small number of columns, reaches a maximum at square configuration, and then decreases with increasing number of columns. The element-number dependence in 2D arrays is smaller than that in 1D arrays.         ",

This allows for a conformal antenna array that adapts to different breast sizes for optimal data collection across various patients, which eliminates undesired signal attenuation in coupling liquid when implemented for the fixed array. By leveraging antenna positions, the breast surface can be pre-estimated, enabling the neural network to focus on image reconstruction within the region of interest.

The proposed method enables accurate direction finding of acoustic sources over both 180 and 360 degrees angular ranges. Numerical simulations confirm the robustness of the metagrating-based compressive sensing approach against noise and limited sampling. Experimental validation is conducted to verify its feasibility with practical metagrating prototyes. Compared wiith tranditional array-based localisation techniques, the single-pixel metagrating system significantly reduces hardward complexity while maintaining high localisation accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of integrating compressive sensing with acoustic metagratings for compact, low-cost, scalable source detection systems, with prospective applications in industrial monitoring, target tracking and non-destructive health monitoring.

In this case, it is commonly assumed that the wavefront distortion of the two is equivalent. In contrast to this assumption, we present experimental evidence of relative wavefront errors (WFEs) between polarization-multiplexed reference beacons and signals, after passing through a 2.4 km atmospheric link. We develop machine learning-based wavefront correction algorithms to compensate for observed WFEs, via phase retrieval, resulting in up to a 2/3 reduction in the relative phase error variance. Further, we analyze the excess noise contributions from relative WFEs in the context of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), where our findings suggest that if future CV-QKD implementations employ wavefront correction algorithms similar to those reported here, an order of magnitude increase in secure key rates may be forthcoming.

To efficiently detect Cherenkov photons in the presence of dominant scintillation signals, an optical filter is placed in front of one of the two SiPMs to suppress photons in the wavelength region corresponding to that of scintillation emission. % In this study, PWO, BGO, and BSO crystals with different dimensions were tested to measure their scintillation light yield and decay time, as well as their transmission and emission spectra. A set of $\\sim 100~\\rm \\mu m$-thick optical filters was also characterized by measuring their transmittance curves. The experimental results were used to model and estimate the expected filter performance in attenuating scintillation light for the various crystals. % The performance of each filter was experimentally validated by measuring the crystal light output with and without the filter using a $^{22}$Na radioactive source and a LYSO:Ce crystal, confirming the accuracy of the calculations. % The results show that interference filters are unsuitable for this application because their transmittance strongly depends on the photon incidence angle.

The metrological-grade optical soliton source produces single-cycle, naturally zero carrier-envelope offset millimetrewave baseband combs. It supports time-domain spectroscopy without any need to temporally align the source and detection pulses, as the ultra-high phase coherence allows significant differences between the optical paths of the source and detection pulses, which we tested over 8m, finding no degradation even in freerunning operation.

    "abstract": "           Dissipative Kerr solitons in optical microresonators have emerged as a powerful tool for compact and coherent frequency comb generation. Advances in nanofabrication have allowed precise dispersion engineering, unlocking octave-spanning soliton combs that are essential for applications such as optical atomic clocks, frequency synthesis, precision spectroscopy, and astronomical spectrometer calibration. However, a key challenge hindering their practical deployment is the intrinsic bandwidth-efficiency trade-off: achieving broadband soliton generation requires large pump detuning, which suppresses power coupling and limits pump-to-comb conversion efficiencies to only a few percent. Recent efforts using pulsed pumping or coupled-resonator architectures have improved efficiency to several tens of percent, yet their bandwidths remain below one-tenth of an octave, inadequate for applications demanding wide spectral coverage. Here, we overcome this limitation by harnessing mode interactions between spatial modes within a single microresonator. The mode hybridization creates an additional power-transfer channel that supports large pump detuning while maintaining strong pump-to-resonator coupling, enabling broadband soliton formation at substantially reduced pump power. Using this approach, we demonstrate an octave-spanning soliton microcomb with a record pump-to-comb conversion efficiency exceeding 50%. These results resolve the fundamental bandwidth-efficiency dilemma in soliton microcombs and paves the way toward fully-integrated, high-efficiency, ultrabroad comb sources for next-generation photonic systems.

The high activation barriers associated with SiC defect formation and motion pose challenges for their study by first-principles molecular dynamics. In this work, we develop and deploy machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to accelerate defect dynamics simulations while retaining ab initio accuracy. We employ an active learning strategy comprising symmetry-adapted collective variable discovery and enhanced sampling to compile configurationally diverse training data, calculation of energies and forces using density functional theory (DFT), and training of an E(3)-equivariant MLIP based on the Allegro model. The trained MLIP reproduces DFT-level accuracy in defect transition activation free energy barriers, enables the efficient and stable simulation of multi-defect 216-atom supercells, and permits an analysis of the temperature dependence of defect thermodynamic stability and formation/annihilation kinetics to propose an optimal annealing temperature to maximally stabilize VV divacancies.

We performed numerical simulations of QPE for the supramolecular approach-based intermolecular interaction energy calculations of the hydrogen-bonded water dimer, using 6 system and 6 ancilla qubits. With the aid of algorithmic error mitigation, the QPE-CASCI simulations achieved interaction energy predictions with an error of 0.02 kcal mol$^{-1}$ relative to the CASCI result, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology.

However, achieving high-power coherent microwave generation in quantum batteries remains fundamentally challenging due to quantum correlations, aging, and self-discharging processes. For the cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED)-based quantum batteries, a further trade-off arises between strong spin-photon coupling for energy storage and sufficient output coupling for power delivery. To overcome these constraints, we introduce dissipation engineering as a dynamic control strategy that temporally separates energy storage and release. By suppressing emission during charging and rapidly enhancing the output coupling during discharging, we realize nanosecond microwave bursts with watt-level peak power. By optimizing three dissipation schemes, we improve work extraction efficiency of the quantum battery by over two orders of magnitude and achieve high power compression factors outperforming the state-of-the-art techniques, establishing dissipation engineering as a pathway toward room-temperature, high-power coherent microwave sources.

The results demonstrate that enabling all-to-all connectivity, instituting a higher expansion order for the SQD algorithm, and adopting a non-Hartree-Fock molecular orbital basis can all play significant roles in overcoming sampling bottlenecks, though with tradeoffs that need to be weighed against the capabilities of quantum and classical hardware.

Evaluation on the Huygens meta-atom design task with the differentiable TorchRDIT solver shows that while both natural language and structured prompting strategies achieve high success rates, structured prompting significantly outperforms in design quality, workflow efficiency, computational cost, and error reduction.

Optimization of the injection phase and cathode-region solenoid yields a robust emittance-stabilization regime with a final normalized emittance of ~3.2 pi mm mrad. To assess prospects for accelerating structured electron beams, we additionally model the quantum evolution of single-electron Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets.

    "abstract": "           Biophotonics - and more recently, biointegrated photonics - offer transformative tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators - optical microcavities formed in spherical structures - have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing. Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW) laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss, well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels.

Recent advances in bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) sources have created opportunities to drive HHG with quantum fields alone. In this work, we demonstrate a regime in which the light-matter interactions can be controlled and tuned using a weak classical field, whose pulse energy is two orders of magnitude lower than that in standard HHG-perturbed by an even weaker quantum field such as BSV. This approach opens new avenues for nonlinear spectroscopy of materials while substantially suppressing strong laser-induced damage, distortions, and heating. We show that a BSV pulse containing less than 5% of the classical driving energy can act as an 'optical dial', allowing tuning of the nonlinear emission spectrum, emission angular dependence, and ionization.

    "abstract": "           We formulate a weakly-nonlinear exit condition for open ends of acoustic waveguides without mean flow; to our knowledge this is the first time an acoustic open end has been analysed outside the linear regime. The resulting admittance boundary condition, and its weakly-nonlinear counterpart, extends recent weakly-nonlinear modelling of curved ducts (Jensen & Brambley 2025, arXiv:2503.11536) to include open ends. We approximate free space by considering the open-ended duct to be enclosed within a much larger concentric duct; within the larger duct, the smaller duct exit is modelled as an acoustic discontinuity. Importantly, the superposition principle is unneeded, allowing the model to be applied in the nonlinear regime. The exit condition can be calculated without needing to solve the full problem in either the outer or inner ducts, making it numerically efficient. The exit condition is validated in the linear regime by comparison to Wiener--Hopf solutions of the duct end correction, and a novel nonlinear end correction is proposed; we find that both non-plane waves and nonlinearity cause the end correction to vary significantly from Rayleigh's classical $0.6$ radii result. A number of numerical illustrations are then discussed, demonstrating nonlinear effects, sound radiating from curved ducts, sound radiating from an exponential horn (representative of brass instrument bells), and the harmonic effects of the open end on in-duct resonances. The model has potential applications to sound in woodwind and brass instruments.         ",

A 5.8 GHz aperture-coupled patch antenna array is developed with a gain of 19.5 dBi, which is a part of the rectenna. A novel Class-F rectifier with a series diode is proposed to achieve a high rectifying efficiency based on harmonic termination techniques. The input circuit of the proposed rectifier is taken into consideration to reach the Class-F condition, while mostly only the output circuit is involved in conventional Class-F designs. A low-pass filter based on defected ground structure is implemented, which not only blocks the harmonics produced in rectifying but also presents desired impedance at harmonics. The current and voltage waveforms on the diode are well enforced. The radiation feature of the rectifier is presented as well. It shows that an optimized cavity, which shields the parasite radiation, may achieve a 5% enhancement on the MW-to-DC conversion efficiency. A C-band rectifier based on HSMS-286 Schottky diode is fabricated and measured. A MPT simple demo system is constructed with the proposed rectifier and antenna. A measured maximum MW-to-DC conversion efficiency of 72% is achieved on the rectifier.

The cost function of a problem is mapped onto the energy function of a physical many-body system, and, by using thermal or quantum fluctuations, the system explores the state space to find the ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the problem. Studies have highlighted both the similarities and differences between thermal and quantum fluctuations. Nevertheless, fundamental understanding of thermal and quantum annealing remains incomplete, making it unclear how quantum annealing outperforms thermal annealing in which problem instances. Here, we investigate the many-body dynamics of thermal and quantum annealing by examining all possible interaction networks of $\\pm J$ Ising spin systems up to seven spins. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that differences between thermal and quantum annealing emerge for particular interaction networks, indicating that the structure of the energy landscape distinguishes the two dynamics. We identify the microscopic origin of these differences through probability fluxes in state space, finding that the two dynamics are broadly similar, but that quantum tunnelling produces qualitative differences. Our results provide insight into how thermal and quantum fluctuations navigate a system toward the ground state in simulated annealing, and are experimentally verifiable in atomic, molecular, and optical systems. Furthermore, these insights may improve mappings of optimization problems to Ising spin systems, yielding more accurate solutions in faster simulated annealing and thus benefiting real-world applications in industry. Our comprehensive survey of interaction networks and visualization of probability flux can help to understand, predict, and control quantum advantage in quantum annealing.         ",
