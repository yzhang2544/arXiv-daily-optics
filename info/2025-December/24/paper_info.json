    "abstract": "           Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.

    "abstract": "           Structured light beams, such as optical vortices carrying orbital angular momentum, are essential for applications ranging from low-power optical communications to high-intensity laser-matter interactions. However, scaling their power and energy while preserving complex phase and spatial structures remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we demonstrate coherent beam combining as a versatile and scalable method for generating high-power structured beams without limitations on topological charge or spatial structure, while maintaining exceptionally high modal purity. We experimentally implement coherent beam combining for optical vortex beams with topological charges l = 1, 5, and 8, achieving a combined average power of 100 W and a peak power of 100 kW, with combining efficiencies of 95.0%, 93.9%, and 91.2%, respectively. Off-axis digital holography confirms that the phase and intensity profiles of the combined beams retain high modal purity, even at high topological charges. These results establish coherent beam combining as an effective route to high modal purity structured light at high power levels, unlocking new opportunities for advanced photonics and high-intensity light-matter interaction studies.

    "abstract": "           Photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) are defects in host photonic crystals (PCs) which create bound states in the PC band gap. These bound states are resonant states of the electromagnetic field with a complex resonance frequency and can have very small mode volumes. PCCs are attractive for a variety of applications, from cavity quantum electrodynamics to biosensing. A PC slab geometry is advantageous given its superior manufacturability compared to three-dimensional crystals, and the accessibility of the surface allows sensing and coupling. However, the emission into the half spaces above and below the slab limits the bound state lifetime. Controlling this emission is thus crucial for applications, most of which benefiting from a long lifetime. A range of methods to find defect geometries suppressing the emission to increase the lifetime have been demonstrated in the past. However, they do not cater for a designed resonant frequency covering a wide addressable range, as needed for multiplexed devices. Here, we demonstrate a design method controlling both resonance frequency and emission, by minimising a cost function including both losses and target frequency. We show applications on PCCs in GaAs PC slabs immersed in water, relevant for biosensing. The reduced refractive index contrast in these structures compared to previously studied PCCs embedded in vacuum renders the emission suppression more challenging. We optimize the quality factor of a standard L3 cavity from 1000 to 10^4-10^5, with an addressable resonance frequency range covering 12% relative bandwidth, spanning more than half of the band gap. We furthermore report optimised structures of H1 cavities, and provide the optimisation code for widespread use.         ",

    "abstract": "           Integrating alkali atomic vapors with nanophotonic devices offers a scalable route to quantum technologies that leverage strong atom-photon interactions. While there have been many approaches to such integration, the general reliance on traditional glass vapor cells, distilled alkali metals, and epoxy sealing limits reproducibility and scalability. Moreover, mitigating adverse Rb-photonics interactions is essential, particularly as devices become more compact and the alkali source lies in close proximity to the photonic elements. Here, we demonstrate the successful operation of compact and fully integrated devices that combine silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with microfabricated borosilicate vapor cells and pill-type rubidium (Rb) dispensers through hermetic seals via anodic bonding. We show how successful operation hinges on optically activating the dispenser in a low-power pulsed mode, releasing controlled amounts of Rb vapor on demand while mitigating photonic degradation. Simultaneously, a counter-propagating desorption laser completely suppresses Rb-induced losses and enables waveguide-based atomic vapor spectroscopy. Using this approach, we demonstrate repeatable control of vapor density by tuning activation pulse length, duty cycle, and device temperature. These results establish a compact, manufacturable, and scalable vapor-PIC device, and set the stage for future demonstrations in cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum nonlinear optics, and chip-scale atomic sensors.

    "abstract": "           The universality of free fall, a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of gravity, has so far only been tested with neutral composite states of first-generation Standard Model (SM) particles, such as atoms or neutrons, and, most recently, antihydrogen. Extending these gravitational measurements to other sectors of the SM requires the formation of neutral bound states using higher-generation, unstable particles. Muonium, the bound state of an antimuon ($\\mu^+$) and an electron ($e^-$), offers the possibility to probe gravity with second-generation (anti)leptons, in the absence of the strong interaction. However, the short $\\mu^+$ lifetime ($\\tau_{\\mu}\\approx 2.2~\\mu$s) and the existing diffuse thermal muonium sources rendered such measurements unfeasible. Here, we report the synthesis of a high-brightness muonium beam, extracted from a thin layer of superfluid helium by exploiting its chemical potential and unique transport properties. The mean longitudinal velocity (${v}\\approx 2180~\\rm{m/s}$) and narrow distribution (${\\Delta v}< 150 ~\\rm{m/s}$) of the atoms characterise a superthermal beam, while yields are similar to the highest intensity diffuse sources. This new beam is expected to enable muonium interferometry and a percent-level measurement of its gravitational acceleration, providing the first direct test of the Weak Equivalence Principle with second-generation (anti)matter. Its unprecedented brightness also opens the way to sub-kHz 1S-2S spectroscopy, enabling precise determination of the muon mass and stringent tests of bound-state quantum electrodynamics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Time-resolved measurement of Auger-Meitner (AM) decay [Nature 419, 803 (2002)] marked a milestone in the development of attosecond science. To date, the time constants for the AM decay processes obtained from the time-domain experiments were found to be consistent with the values deduced from conventional energy-domain measurements. One of the main factors limiting the temporal resolution of these studies is the unlocked carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) of the laser pulses used to probe the electronic dynamics triggered by inner-shell photoabsorption. In this work, we report time-resolved inner-shell electron spectroscopy of xenon and krypton using attosecond soft X-ray (atto-SXR) pulses centered at 130 eV in combination with CEP-stabilized few-cycle Yb laser pulses. We observed that the N$_{4,5}$OO Auger electrons from xenon exhibit a clear streaking pattern, but with an unexpected time shift of $\\sim$ 1.32 fs relative to the 4$d$ photoelectrons. Furthermore, the energy-integrated yield of streaked Auger electrons from xenon exhibits a pronounced minimum at a pump-probe time delay of 4 fs. Neither of these observations can be explained by current streaking theories and both are inconsistent with lifetimes inferred from energy-domain measurements. The M$_{4,5}$NN Auger electrons from krypton partly overlap in energy with the 3$d$ inner-shell photoelectrons and do not show these anomalous features. This study offers new insights into the inner-shell electron dynamics of heavy atoms in the giant dipole resonance region, laying the groundwork for attosecond soft X-ray spectroscopy of molecular systems containing iodine or bromine atoms.

    "abstract": "           High modulation efficiency and a compact footprint are critical for next-generation electro-optic (EO) modulators. We introduce a new class of non-resonant recirculating phase modulators (PMs) that boosts modulation efficiency by repeatedly modulating the optical field within a single, non-resonant waveguide, while fundamentally removing the loop-length matching constraint that has limited prior recirculating schemes. This architectural breakthrough simultaneously enables a much smaller device footprint and an extended low-V$\\pi$ bandwidth, without relying on narrowband resonances. Building on this concept, we experimentally demonstrate both a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and a cascaded PM, and verify their versatility in finite impulse response (FIR) filtering and optical frequency comb (OFC) generation. The recirculating MZM operates as a 4-tap rectangular-window FIR filter with 110 GHz bandwidth in a compact 2.889$\\times$0.58 mm$^2$ footprint. The cascaded PM achieves a 3.40 GHz low-V$\\pi$ bandwidth, a 110 GHz resonant EO bandwidth, and a V$\\pi$L of 0.7 V$\\cdot$cm, and generates 20 OFC lines under a 33 dBm microwave drive.

Throughout the transmission process, the inherent challenges of long-haul signal propagation inevitably introduce multiple noise components, including but not limited to thermal noise, phase fluctuations, and environmental interference. The system incline to use the conventional evaluation index - Allan deviation (ADEV) to reflect the system stability in order to evaluate the noise level. Whereas, ADEV can only provide numerical expression and lacks the time-frequency details. Therefore, a complete evaluation system is required by the system. In this paper, we present a groundbreaking integration of ADEV and wavelet transformed empirical mode decomposition (EMD-WT), establishing a novel analytical framework that enables simultaneous characterization of noise types and time-frequency domain properties. This synergistic approach achieves unprecedented dual-domain resolution in noise discrimination in frequency transfer systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           The transverse magnetic (TM) modes of a spherical cavity satisfy a dispersion relation connecting the angular eigenvalue $\\nu$ to the resonant frequency through zeros of the spherical Bessel function derivative. Analytic continuation of this dispersion relation to $\\nu = -1$ yields a formal zero-frequency endpoint where $j_{-1}(x) = \\cos x / x$ admits the root $x = 0$. We examine this limit in detail, showing that while the mathematics is well-defined, the endpoint does not correspond to a physical electromagnetic mode. The positivity of the angular Sturm-Liouville operator restricts physical eigenvalues to $\\nu \\geq 0$, placing $\\nu = -1$ outside the admissible spectrum. We demonstrate that all electromagnetic field components vanish in this limit, even though the underlying Debye potential $\\Pi = \\cos(kr)/kr$ remains non-trivial and exhibits a monopole-type singularity at the origin. This distinction between potential and field reflects the kernel structure of the curl-curl operator for spherically symmetric configurations. The analysis clarifies the boundary between propagating electromagnetic modes and static field configurations in spherical geometry, connecting the formal endpoint to longstanding questions about mode counting in cavity quantization.

To explore the thermal equilibrium properties of large MR systems at finite electronic temperatures, in the present work, we propose the finite-temperature (FT) extension of TAO-DFT, denoted as FT-TAO-DFT.

In addition, we also develop FT-TAO-DFT-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), denoted as FT-TAO-QM/MM, to provide a cost-effective description of the thermal equilibrium properties of a QM subsystem with MR character embedded in an MM environment at finite temperatures. Moreover, the FT-TAO-DFT, FT-TAO-AIMD, and FT-TAO-QM/MM methods are employed to explore the radical nature and infrared (IR) spectra of n-acenes (n = 2--6), consisting of n linearly fused benzene rings, in vacuum and in an argon (Ar) matrix at finite temperatures. According to our calculations, for n-acenes at 1000 K or below, the electronic temperature effects on the radical nature and IR spectra are very minor, while the nuclear temperature effects on these properties are noticeable. For n-acene in an Ar matrx at absolute zero, the Ar matrix has minimal impact on the radical nature of n-acene, while the co-deposition procedure of n-acene and Ar atoms may affect the IR spectrum of n-acene.

For head-on scattering we show that a tight symmetrically focused laser pulse, that balances laser intensity and interaction time, optimizes the x-ray brilliance.

This study leverages different interface-engineering strategies to examine the influence of electrode-piezopolymer interface morphology on piezoelectric, dielectric, and acoustic behavior in flexible transducers. Devices were fabricated using silver (Ag), gold (Au), graphene flakes (GF), laser-induced graphene (LIG), and Au-decorated LIG electrodes, enabling comparison across interfacial architectures. LIG-based transducers showed strong acoustic and piezoelectric output due to partial infiltration of the piezopolymer into the porous LIG network, which enhances interfacial contact and stress transfer. Au-based transducers achieved comparable acoustic output. In contrast, dense Ag electrodes and layered GF films provided limited coupling, resulting in reduced electromechanical response. LIG-based transducers exhibited the highest flexibility and durability, retaining stable performance after 10,000 bending cycles and an eight-week aging study, whereas GF, Ag, and Au devices degraded under bending, and Ag electrodes declined over time. These findings demonstrate that engineering the electrode-polymer interface is critical for high-performance flexible ultrasound transducers and identify LIG as a strong candidate for wearable imaging applications.

Their exceptional stability and strong resistance to atmospheric turbulence make them a compelling alternative to conventional Gaussian and other structured beams for free-space optical systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the physical principles, generation strategies, experimental realizations, and emerging applications of OPBs. By precise spatial modulation of the optical wave vectors, OPBs achieve highly collimated, self-reconstructing propagation with distinctive pin-like features that confer remarkable robustness and self-healing capability. We further discuss several OPB derivatives--including vortex, inverted, and vortex-inverted OPBs--which expand the functional landscape by enabling flexible control over amplitude, phase, polarization, and orbital angular momentum. Experimentally, OPBs have demonstrated outstanding performance across diverse platforms, ranging from free-space and underwater optical communications to optical trapping and super-resolution imaging. With their unique combination of propagation stability, light-field tunability, and environmental adaptability, OPBs hold strong promise for next-generation optical communication, precision sensing, and advanced imaging technologies. This review summarizes recent research progresses in OPBs and highlights key opportunities and prospects for advancing their scientific discoveries and practical applications.         ",

In this work, we introduce a convolutional photonic accelerator that employs programmable kernels manifesting as trainable waveforms in the frequency domain to enable low-energy, high-throughput scalable image classification. The proposed scheme inherently provides dimensionality reduction and feature extraction directly in the optical domain. Numerical results targeting the Fashion-MNIST show that by using only 16 optical nodes, the system's classification accuracy tops at 90.1% when typical backpropagation is used. Moreover, by adapting the training technique to the forward-forward approach, a marginal drop of 1% is recorded compared to the backpropagation scenario, thus showcasing the compatibility of the overall architecture with a hardware-friendly training approach. Finally, we experimentally implement the trained kernels using a programmable waveshaper. Despite the difference between the simulated and experimentally generated transfer functions of the programmable kernels, the classification accuracy based on the experimentally obtained kernels exhibits a marginal 0.2% reduction, proving the validity of the idea and its high robustness to variations of the frequency-applied complex weights.

To date, this understanding has primarily focused on lattice spin systems; in practice however, dipolar spin systems$\\unicode{x2014}$ranging from ultracold molecules to nuclear spin ensembles and solid-state color centers$\\unicode{x2014}$often exhibit significant amounts of positional disorder. Here, we develop a theory for scalable spin squeezing in a two-dimensional randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles, which naturally realize a dipolar XXZ model. Via extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram for finite-temperature XY order, and by extension scalable spin squeezing, as a function of both disorder and Ising anisotropy. As the disorder increases, we find that scalable spin squeezing survives only near the Heisenberg point. We show that this behavior is due to the presence of rare tightly-coupled dimers, which effectively heat the system post-quench. In the case of strongly-interacting nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that an experimentally feasible strategy to decouple the problematic dimers from the dynamics is sufficient to enable scalable spin squeezing.

Here, we report 2,400 Ytterbium-174 atoms trapped in an optical tweezer array with enhanced single-atom loading efficiency of 83.5(1)%. Notably, the loading efficiency is largely maintained for array sizes ranging from dozens to thousands, exhibiting excellent scalability. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the enhanced loading method by showing that the enhancement exists robustly across a range of interatomic potentials, suggesting its utility for other atomic species.

The key idea is to recast excited-state preparation as an effective ground-state problem by suitably modifying the underlying Lindblad dynamics so that the target excited state becomes the unique steady state of a designed quantum channel. We develop three complementary strategies, tailored to different types of prior information about the excited state, such as symmetry and approximate energy.

    "abstract": "           Accurately calibrating the center-of-mass (CoM) offset between the spacecraft (SC) and the inertial sensor test mass (TM) is crucial for space-based gravitational-wave (GW) antennas, such as LISA and Taiji. Current calibration methods require additional spacecraft maneuvers that disrupt science data continuity and inter-satellite links, compromising the coherence of gravitational wave signals. Here, we present a maneuver-free calibration scheme that directly estimates the CoM offset vector using only standard science-mode measurements from inertial sensors, interferometers, and differential wavefront sensors. By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis. For LISA-like missions, where data continuity is paramount for detecting faint gravitational wave signals, this method will enhance scientific output and reliability.         ",

We create a chiral vector wave packet by transmitting ultrashort laser pulse via a birefringent or magneto-optic medium. Employing time-resolved leakage radiation microscopy, we examine how the real and imaginary components of the weak value parameter ($\\epsilon$) influence pulse propagation over time. Our technique allows us to detect and categorize the temporal polarization fluctuation in a $75$ fs pulse with an excellent repeatability. The achieved experimental results demonstrate a satisfactory consistency with the theoretical predictions.         ",

    "title": "Laser Stabilised Ionising Transitions",
    "abstract": "           We investigate a ionising electronic transition under resonant pumping. We demonstrate that, above a critical value of the pump intensity, a novel metastable electronic bound state is created, which can decay into the free electron continuum by two-photon ionization. We calculate the system's resonant fluorescence spectrum, finding results qualitatively different from the Mollow triplet expected in a bound-to-bound transition. The fluorescent emission can be used to measure the time-resolved population of the novel metastable state. Contrary to Kramers-Hennenberger atoms, stabilised by non-perturbative, non-resonant laser pulses, the physics we observe is inherently resonant and relies on perturbative level repulsion. In analogy to how the AC-Stark shift is a semiclassical version of the single-photon Rabi splitting observed in photonic cavity, the phenomenon we describe is better understood as a semiclassical version of recently observed excitons bound by a single cavity photon. Our results demonstrate a novel way to stabilise electronic states with intense laser fields, increasing our capability to design and engineer non-classical states of matter.         ",

    "title": "Fine-tuning physics-informed neural networks for cavity flows using coordinate transformation",
    "abstract": "           Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted attention as an alternative approach to solve partial differential equations using a deep neural network (DNN). Their simplicity and capability allow them to solve inverse problems for many applications. Despite the versatility of PINNs, it remains challenging to reduce their training cost. Using a DNN pre-trained with an arbitrary dataset with transfer learning or fine-tuning is a potential solution. However, a pre-trained model using a different geometry and flow condition than the target may not produce suitable results. This paper proposes a fine-tuning approach for PINNs with coordinate transformation, modelling lid-driven cavity flows with various shapes. We formulate the inverse problem, where the reference data inside the domain and wall boundary conditions are given. A pre-trained PINN model with an arbitrary Reynolds number and shape is used to initialize a target DNN. To reconcile the reference shape with different targets, governing equations as a loss of the PINNs are given with coordinate transformation using a deformation gradient tensor. Numerical examples for various cavity flows with square, rectangular, shear deformed and inflated geometries demonstrate that the proposed fine-tuning approach improves the training convergence compared with a randomly-initialized model. A pre-trained model with a similar geometry to the target further increases training efficiency. These findings are useful for real-world applications such as modelling intra-aneurysmal blood flows in clinical use.         ",

    "abstract": "           Enhancing proton energy is of great importance in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. We demonstrate an unusual acceleration scheme that achieves higher proton energies at lower laser energies by reducing the focal spot size. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at small spot sizes (0.8 {\\mu}m), the proton energy is enhanced by 83.5%, much higher than that under conventional spot sizes (3 {\\mu}m). This is because the proton acceleration is dominated by electrons driven by an enhanced ponderomotive force at small spot sizes, generating stronger charge-separation fields that propagate faster. To further improve the proton energy, we analytically derive an optimal electron density profile, which enables phase-stable proton acceleration with an energy increased by 60%. These results are robust across parameter variations, suggesting that advanced focusing techniques and optimal plasma profiles could loose the requirement of laser energy, potentially reducing the dependence on large-scale laser facilities for medical and scientific applications.

We analyze eigenvalue distributions and the localization properties of the eigenmodes, comparing them with those of the corresponding Hermitian lattices. Furthermore, we study their transport behavior under single-channel excitation and identify unconventional phenomena such as jumps between distant lattice regions in systems with a purely real spectrum, as well as complex spectrum-induced Anderson jumps, reported here for the first time in two dimensions. Our results establish a reference framework for non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder and open new directions for future studies of localization phenomena.         ",
