In this work, the feasibility of fabrication of a useful multi-mode GHz cavity is explored. Two kinds of plastics, two slicing approaches and two metal coating techniques were used to build a series of clamped cavities with thin inner copper surface on otherwise 3D printed plastic surface. The cavities were then bench-tested to identify spatial field distributions, operating frequencies and quality factors (Q-factor). Pros and cons of the used fabrication approaches were identified and understood, and the performance of longitudinally sliced painted cavity design demonstrated considerable practicality of 3D-printing approach in designing rf systems.

    "abstract": "           We present an ultrasensitive technique for probing transient optical changes in atomically thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) layers integrated onto silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) ring resonators. The MoS$_2$ is illuminated by a femtosecond laser, while a tunable near-infrared (NIR) continuous-wave laser probes the microresonator resonance. The NIR light polarization can be adjusted to either transverse electric (TE, parallel to the 2D material) or transverse magnetic (TM, perpendicular), a configuration that is impossible to achieve with conventional normal-incidence pump-probe techniques. By capturing the transmitted signal on a fast oscilloscope, we detect transient optical shifts with unprecedented sensitivity, observing phenomena over time scales ranging from picoseconds to microseconds. Our results reveal both a rapid, carrier-induced nonlinear optical shift in the resonance, and a slower thermo-optic transient. The ability to simultaneously measure these fast and slow dynamics offers new insight into the complex optoelectronic behavior of 2D materials when integrated with microresonators. This method provides a significant advance over traditional pump-probe approaches, enabling the detection of exceedingly small transient signals and opening new avenues for exploring the optical properties of atomically thin materials. Our findings highlight the potential of this approach for investigating polarization-dependent nonlinear effects, with applications in photonics, sensing, and optoelectronics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Accurately and efficiently describing strongly correlated electronic systems is a central challenge in quantum computational chemistry, with classical and quantum computers. The localized active space self-consistent field method (LASSCF) uses a product of fragment active spaces as a variational space, with the Schr\u00f6dinger equation solved exactly in each fragment and the fragment active-space orbitals defined in a self-consistent manner. LASSCF is accurate for systems with strong intra-fragment and weak inter-fragment correlation, and its computational cost is combinatorial with respect to the size of the individual fragment active spaces, rather than their product. However, exactly solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in each fragment remains a substantial bottleneck. Here, we address the possibility of solving the fragment active space Schr\u00f6dinger equation with approximate methods, particularly sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD). SQD is a technique that uses a quantum computer to sample configurations from a chemically motivated quantum circuit and a classical computer to mitigate errors and solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in a subspace of the configuration space. We apply the proposed method, LASSQD, to the [Fe(H$_2$O)$_4$]$_2$bpym$^{4+}$ compound and the [Fe$^{\\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\\mathrm{II}}$($\\mu$$_3$-O)-(HCOO)$_6$] complex for calculating the intermediate-spin ground state energies. We observe that LASSQD can tackle fragment sizes intractable by LASSCF, achieves within 1kcal/mol agreement to LASSCF, and delivers results that are competitive with alternative classical methods to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and thus can be used as a starting point for a perturbative treatment (LASSQD-PDFT) to recover correlation external to the active space.

Using a Niobium STM tip to form a superconductor-insulator-normal metal (SIN) tunnel junction, the evolution of coherence peaks at the SC-gap edge are carefully measured to characterize the RF losses and electron temperature. We further identify impedance matching as a crucial factor to achieve high sensitivity in the reflectometry by tuning the tip-sample capacitance as a function of approach distance. As a demonstration of this capability, we measure a 50x50 nm$^2$ area of island features that have been condensed onto the surface of a gold single crystal. Position dependent reflectometry losses allow us to image island sizes down to a total surface area of 5 nm$^2$ given our current sensitivity.         ",

    "abstract": "           Analog bolometers based on temperature-dependent phase-transition materials such as vanadium oxide (VOx) and barium titanate (BTO) represent the state of the art in uncooled infrared detectors. Recently, the first room-temperature spintronic Poisson bolometer based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) was proposed and demonstrated as a promising infrared detector. Unlike conventional bolometers, the spintronic Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, where the response is governed by resistance fluctuations arising from thermally activated magnetization transitions. Spontaneous transitions between two metastable magnetic states occur even in the absence of incident light, and the transition probability increases under illumination. In this work, we experimentally study the statistical properties of the optical response of the spintronic Poisson bolometer under illumination. We demonstrate that transitions in spintronic Poisson bolometers, both in the absence and presence of light, exhibit Poissonian behavior, with transition rates and interarrival times modulated by incident radiation. Under illumination, we observe a 153% increase in the count rate accompanied by a 70% reduction in interarrival time. These results establish spintronic Poisson bolometers as a promising platform for probabilistic, high-speed, and high-sensitivity infrared detection at room temperature.         ",

In photonic crystals, NHPG and the NHSE have previously been explored mainly through material loss, where the typically low $Q$ factors make direct observation of complex frequencies challenging. Here, we demonstrate the direct experimental observation of an NHPG by using a radiation-loss-based non-Hermitian photonic crystal. Radiation loss can be engineered through structural design, enabling control of the imaginary part of the complex frequency and allowing relatively high $Q$ factors. This approach is compatible with widely used absorption-free silicon-slab photonic crystals. We developed a measurement system that can measure photonic bands along arbitrary lines in $k$-space. Our measurements demonstrated direct observation of the NHPG in photonic crystals, and the reversal of non-Hermitian topology through the flip of loop rotation in a complex plane. Our platform, which requires neither gain media nor synthetic dimensions, establishes radiation-loss engineering as a simple and versatile route for photonic functionality using an NHSE in nanophotonic systems.

TAO can measure the reactor antineutrino energy spectrum with excellent energy resolution (better than 2\\% at 1 MeV) using state-of-the-art Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) operated at low temperature. To achieve this goal, the SiPMs (together with their readout electronics) must be well calibrated. This paper presents the channel-level calibration methods for the dark count rate (DCR), relative photon detection efficiency (PDE), time offset, gain, and internal optical crosstalk (IOCT) of the SiPMs based on charge and time information of the collected events. For the calibration of the external optical crosstalk (EOCT), in terms of its rate and emission angle distribution, a novel method is proposed by switching on and off different groups of SiPMs with an LED placed in the detector. Using one million simulated events, the expected calibration biases are evaluated for all the aforementioned parameters: relative PDE (2.1\\%), IOCT (1.4\\%), DCR (0.4\\%), EOCT Rate ($<0.1\\%$), gain ($<0.1\\%$), time offset (0.027 ns).

    "abstract": "           Hyperspectral optical imaging provides rich spectral information for estimating continuous environmental and material parameters; however, its high dimensionality and strong feature correlation pose significant challenges for machine learning models, especially when ground-truth datasets are limited. In this study, we investigate a hyperspectral dataset composed of 150 spectral bands with soil moisture as the target variable. To address the curse of dimensionality, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed as a baseline dimensionality reduction technique. The optimal number of principal components was determined to be two, retaining more than 99% of the total variance. This selection was supported by the analysis of the covariance matrix, eigenvalue distribution, and the scree plot. Projecting the data onto the first two principal components enabled improved visualization and interpretability compared to the original high-dimensional feature space. The reduced representation also revealed a clearer separation of target values, effectively decreasing data complexity. To evaluate the impact of dimensionality reduction on predictive performance, a Random Forest regression model was trained to estimate soil moisture from the PCA-transformed data. The model achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) of 94.7 %, demonstrating that PCA-based feature reduction can enhance computational efficiency while preserving strong predictive capability in hyperspectral machine learning workflows.

By bridging classical electrodynamics description for quasi-normal modes (retardation effects included) with a quantum emitter perspective, this framework provides an analytically tractable description of the damping of the dissipative confined plasmonic systems. In addition to its significance for emission control, the model emphasizes the bosonic characteristics of plasmonic quasi-particles, which are coherent many-electron excitations of the states of quasi-normal modes. Unlike conventional cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED), where the emitter and cavity exist as separate systems, a plasmonic quasi-particle functions as a quantum emitter embedded within a self-created resonant near-field nano-cavity of confined radial fields, sharing the spectral characteristics of the surface transverse-magnetic (TM) modes, which include nonradiative damping effects resulting from, e.g., ohmic losses in a metal. This work extends Fermi's Golden Rule to include the coupling between the emission process and the self-generated cavity impact. The derived self-consistent formulation offers analytical expressions for the total damping rates, which demonstrate a size-dependent suppression displayed in higher multipolarity modes attributed to the impact of the self-quenching effect resulting from the coaction of radiative and non-radiative channels.

While calcium imaging has been firmly established as a workhorse technique for monitoring neuronal activity, its limited temporal resolution and indirect measurement restrict its ability to capture rapid inhibitory and excitatory events and subthreshold voltage oscillations. In contrast, voltage imaging directly measures membrane potential fluctuations, providing a comprehensive and precise representation of neuronal circuit dynamics. Recent advancements in voltage-sensitive dyes and, particularly, genetically encoded voltage indicators have significantly enhanced the feasibility of voltage imaging, prompting the development of advanced fluorescence microscopy methods optimized for high-speed acquisition. However, achieving millisecond-scale temporal resolution remains challenging due to inherent trade-offs among imaging speed, spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio. Conventional raster-scanning approaches, including confocal microscopy, are fundamentally limited by their slow frame rates, precluding the capture of rapid neuronal events from multiple neurons simultaneously. Alternative techniques such as random-access scanning, spatiotemporal multiplexing, and computational optical imaging have successfully addressed these constraints, enabling kilohertz-level imaging of neuronal activity in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional contexts.

Specifically, we reinterpret the Margolus-Levitin and Mandelstam-Tamm bounds as estimators of the energy expectation value and variance, respectively, and relate them to the shortest time for the processor to orthogonalize a quantum state. This shortest gate time, expected to lie on the nanosecond scale, is inferred from job execution times measured in seconds by employing gate-time amplification. We apply the method to IBM's superconducting quantum processor and estimate the energy scales associated with single-, two-, and three-qubit gates. The order of estimated energy is consistent with typical drive energies in superconducting qubit systems, suggesting that current gate operations approach the quantum speed limit. Our results demonstrate that fundamental energetic properties of black-box quantum computers can be quantitatively accessed through operational time measurements, reflecting the conjugate relationship between time and energy imposed by the uncertainty principle.

In this work, we present QuantGraph, a two-stage quantum-enhanced framework that casts local and global graph-optimization problems as quantum searches over discrete trajectory spaces. The solver is designed to operate efficiently by first finding a sequence of locally optimal transitions in the graph (local stage), without considering full trajectories. The accumulated cost of these transitions acts as a threshold that prunes the search space (up to 60% reduction for certain examples). The subsequent global stage, based on this threshold, refines the solution. Both stages utilize variants of the Grover-adaptive-search algorithm. To achieve scalability and robustness, we draw on principles from control theory and embed QuantGraph's global stage within a receding-horizon model-predictive-control scheme. This classical layer stabilizes and guides the quantum search, improving precision and reducing computational burden. In practice, the resulting closed-loop system exhibits robust behavior and lower overall complexity. Notably, for a fixed query budget, QuantGraph attains a 2x increase in control-discretization precision while still benefiting from Grover-search's inherent quadratic speedup compared to classical methods.

    "title": "An introduction to nonlinear fiber optics and optical analogues to gravitational phenomena",
    "abstract": "           The optical fiber is a revolutionary technology of the past century. It enables us to manipulate single modes in nonlinear interactions with precision at the quantum level without involved setups. This setting is useful in the field of analogue gravity (AG), where gravitational phenomena are investigated in accessible analogue lab setups. These lecture notes provide an account of this AG framework and applications. Although light in nonlinear dielectrics is discussed in textbooks, the involved modelling often includes many assumptions that are directed at optical communications, some of which are rarely detailed. Here, we provide a self-contained and sufficiently detailed description of the propagation of light in fibers, with a minimal set of assumptions, which is relevant in the context of AG. Starting with the structure of a step-index fiber, we derive linear-optics propagating modes and show that the transverse electric field of the fundamental mode is well approximated as linearly polarized and of a Gaussian profile. We then incorporate a cubic nonlinearity and derive a general wave envelope propagation equation. With further simplifying assumptions, we arrive at the famous nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which governs fundamental effects in nonlinear fibers, such as solitons. As a first application in AG, we show how intense light in the medium creates an effective background spacetime for probe light akin to the propagation of a scalar field in a black hole spacetime. We introduce optical horizons and particle production in this effective spacetime, giving rise to the optical Hawking effect. Furthermore, we discuss two related light emission mechanisms. Finally, we present a second optical analogue model for the oscillations of black holes, the quasinormal modes, which are important in the program of black hole spectroscopy.         ",

The optical pattern is generated using superoscillatory phenomenon leading to subwavelength traps with full control of the trap relative phases. We investigate two sets of relative phases that impede or allow the hopping and the reshuffling of atoms.

By independently varying these two parameters, we systematically explore diverse honeycomb lattice geometries and their bandgap properties. This transformation from circular to triangular air-gap holes enables suppression of both electromagnetic and elastic wave modes through Bragg scattering and symmetry modulation. We demonstrate that systematic variation of R and l allows tuning of photonic and phononic bandgaps upto 49.7% and 24.8% respectively. This possibility of geometrically tuning bandgaps provide a strong foundation for applications in Bragg filters, sensors etc. without the need for complex defects or exotic materials.         ",

    "abstract": "           Light is the fundamental medium through which we perceive the world around us. In the modern era, light can not only be used in its raw form but can also be used as a versatile tool. Generally, light fields carry energy and momentum (both linear and angular). Due to the transfer of linear momentum from light to matter, the radiation pressure is exerted, whereas, the intrinsic spin angular momentum (SAM) is associated with the polarization states of light. Light fields embedded with optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) -- also known as optical vortices or phase singular beams -- have truly revolutionized the field of optics and extended our basic understanding of the light-matter interaction process across various scales. Optical vortices -- spatially characterized by the presence of twisted phase fronts and a central intensity null -- have found a myriad of applications starting from microparticle trapping and manipulation to microscopy, optical communication, and quantum information science, among others. Here, we revisit some of the fundamental concepts on optical vortices and discuss extensively on how this new dimension of light i.e., the OAM, has been exploited in both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. We discuss the different types of vortex beams, the techniques used to generate and detect their OAM, and their propagation. Particularly, we put a special emphasis on the utilization of vortex beams in nonlinear regimes to explain different optical phenomena such as the second harmonic generation, parametric down-conversion, and high-order harmonic generation. The generation of vortex beams in the UV to XUV regimes, encoded with higher OAM values, could potentially extend their application range to areas such as high-capacity data transmission, stimulated emission depletion microscopy, phase-contrast imaging, and particle trapping in optical tweezers, among others.

    "abstract": "           The dynamic interplay between light and electric field control of charge states lies at the heart of developing multifunctional optoelectronic devices. While persistent photoconductivity (PPC) and gate-voltage (VG)-induced electron trapping are well-known phenomena in oxide heterostructures, their mutual coupling remains poorly explored. Here, we report that the non-equilibrium state established by PPC can effectively modulate the efficacy of VG-induced electron trapping in a STO/Al heterostructure. The PPC, characterized by a slow relaxation (8.5 hours at 4 K) after sub-illumination, originates from the re-trapping of photoexcited carriers into deep-level states. In contrast, VG-induced trapping, governed by shallow states, exhibits much faster dynamics ({100 - 400 s). Crucially, we discover that the strength of VG-induced trapping is not constant but is dynamically modulated by the PPC relaxation process. The trapping amplitude is strongly amplified after illumination and recovers only after the deep-level states are substantially refilled, precisely following the PPC relaxation time constant. Furthermore, the electron trapping effect diminishes with increasing temperature and vanishes near the ferroelastic phase transition of STO (110 K), confirming that ferroelastic twin walls and associated oxygen vacancy clusters are the physical origin of the traps. Our findings reveal a novel optical gating mechanism for electron trapping, paving the way for designing non-volatile, optically programmable electronic devices.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present a technique that uses an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to image magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution and sensitivity. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization -- analogous to pulsed ODMR -- while the microwave field continuously drives the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microwire with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and, with our diamond, achieves $\\text{nT}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$-level per-pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems.

Here, we report the strongly enhanced optical nonlinearity for their typical representative high quality TiN epitaxial films with thicknesses down to a few nanometers. Systematic Z_scan measurements reveal a pronounced increase in nonlinear absorption with decreasing thickness. Especially in the ENZ spectral region, the TD TiN films exhibit nearly two orders of magnitude stronger nonlinear absorption over a broad range of incidence angles as compared to conventional thin films. The enhanced nonlinear absorption observed is well described by a nonlinear nonlocal electromagnetic response model that accounts for electron confinement effects unique to the TD plasmonic systems. Comparison with Ti1_xAlxN highlights the necessity of low-loss ENZ response for nonlinear enhancement. These findings identify TiN and similar TD plasmonic systems as a robust refractory platform for exploiting ENZ mediated nonlinear processes in ultrathin photonic material structures.         ",

Here, this limitation is overcome based on a fanin process designed in a tree-like bucket-brigade architecture. It suppresses the error propagation between different branches, thus exponentially improving the robustness compared to existing depth-optimal methods. Moreover, the approach here simultaneously achieves the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant circuit depth, gate count, and STA. As an example of application, we show that for quantum simulation of geometrically local Hamiltonian, the code distance of each logic qubit can potentially be reduced exponentially using our technique.

Given that a dipole's resonant wavelength is fixed by geometry, the resonant frequency $f_{res}$ (measured as an S-parameter reflection coefficient [`$S_{11}$'] minimum) scales inversely with the local refractive index, allowing a translation of a depth-dependent $S_{11}$(z) profile into $n(z)$. $S_{11}$(z) data were initially taken in August, 2024 using a dipole lowered into a newly-drilled $98\\pm 1$-mm diameter, 350-m deep borehole at Summit Station, Greenland, approximately 1 km from the site of the original GISP-2 core; improved measurements were subsequently made in May, 2025.

Although both rely on interference, the interfering components of clocks are spatially colocated, whereas atom interferometers are based on spatial superpositions. Both the electromagnetic fields that drive the transitions and generate superpositions, while propagating through spacetime, as well as the atoms themselves as massive particles are influenced by gravitational waves, leading to effective potentials that induce phase differences inferred by the sensor. In this work, we analyze the effects of these potentials on atomic clocks and atom interferometers in the laboratory frame. We show that spatial superpositions in atom interferometers, both light-pulse and guided ones, give rise to a gravitational-wave signal. Although these spatial superpositions are suppressed for clocks, we show that the light pulses driving internal transitions measure the spatial distance between the centers of two separate clocks. We highlight that this mechanism only yields a sensitivity if both clocks, including possible trapping setups, move on geodesics given by the gravitational wave. While such configurations are natural for satellite free-fliers, terrestrial optical clocks usually rely on stationary traps, rendering them insensitive to leading order. Moreover, we show that both sensors can be enhanced by composite interrogation protocols in a common framework. To this end, we propose a pulse sequence that can be used for large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers and for hyper-echo atomic clocks, leading to a signal enhancement and noise suppression.

    "title": "Quantum error mitigation using energy sampling and extrapolation enhanced Clifford data regression",
    "abstract": "           Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.         ",
