    "title": "Optical feedback induced irregular and chaotic dynamics in terahertz quantum cascade laser combs",
    "abstract": "           In this work, we systematically investigate the optical feedback dynamics of terahertz (THz) frequency combs generated from quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) using the effective semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch equations (ESMBEs). Starting from a free-running comb state at low bias (1.3Ith), we identify clear bifurcation routes as the external feedback is increased. In the weak feedback regime (C<1), the frequency comb operation remains stable; as feedback increases to the moderate feedback regime (1<C<2.4), the system transitions through frequency splitting into period-one (P1) oscillations around each comb, followed by higher-order bifurcations (P2, P4, P8). Within the range 2.4<C<13.86, only combs with P1 states are observed, with the split frequency increasing continuously with feedback strength. In the strong feedback regime (C>13.86), complex feedback dynamics re-emerged but with significantly reduced complexity compared with the weak feedback regime. More interestingly, we show that optical feedback can induce chaotic THz emission at higher bias current conditions (>1.6Ith), when the free-running laser output (C=0) is originally a stable frequency comb. The resulting chaotic dynamics, characterized by broadband spectra and large positive Lyapunov exponents, are shown to depend strongly on the linewidth enhancement factor. Although THz QCLs widely considered as ultrastable under external perturbations, this work provides the first detailed report of chaotic dynamics and routes to chaos in THz QCLs under optical feedback. These findings not only deepen the understanding of nonlinear dynamics in THz QCLs but also open new possibilities for exploiting applications of chaotic light in THz sensing, imaging and secure communications.

    "abstract": "           We report the existence of multi-peaked vector soliton families in normally dispersive passive Kerr resonators. Through cross-phase modulation between two orthogonal polarization components, each peak becomes tightly interlocked, enabling robust localization of the entire wave packet in defocusing cavities. Analysis using snakes-and-ladder diagrams demonstrates the diversity of these vector soliton families, which include dark-bright multi-peak solitons, flat-topped solitons, and modulation instability patterns, among others. Furthermore, stability analysis based on the coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations reveals that specific combinations of parameters can sustain stable vector cavity solitons, whose peak numbers can be continuously tuned by adding appropriate perturbations. These findings significantly expand the scope of soliton dynamics and optical frequency comb generation in pumped-dissipative systems, independent of dispersion conditions.         ",

Near-petahertz fieldoscopy has recently demonstrated sub-cycle access to light-matter interactions, enabling label-free spectro-microscopy of liquids and solids with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, detection sensitivity, and dynamic range. However, current implementations still rely on temporal scanning and averaging over many laser pulses. Here, we introduce photonic time-stretch fieldoscopy, enabling single-shot electric-field detection at near-petahertz frequencies. Numerical results demonstrate that integrating fieldoscopy with a nonlinear time lens enables the real-time acquisition of ultrashort optical waveforms with a detection bandwidth approaching petahertz. The resulting large temporal aperture and attosecond resolution allow direct single-shot detection of transient electric fields generated in solid or liquid samples. This concept opens new avenues for petahertz electronics, ultrafast spectro-microscopy, and the study of dynamic, non-repetitive optical phenomena         ",

It has been shown that Bi-based subwavelength optical cavities show outstanding features, including broad tuneable resonances for structural color generation and broadband perfect absorption for light harvesting. While current devices are based on continuous Bi films, integrating ultrathin films around the percolation threshold with a tailored morphology promises to enable more compact devices with a wider tunability range and/or enhanced optical response. In this context, we report the tailoring of the morphology and UV-Vis-NIR effective optical dielectric function ( $\\varepsilon$= $\\varepsilon_1$+i$\\varepsilon_2$) of ultrathin Bi films around the percolation threshold. Just below percolation, the films effective optical permittivity $\\varepsilon_1$ differs markedly from that of a continuous film, as it turns from negative to positive while its effective optical loss $\\varepsilon_2$ is reduced. We showcase the relevance of such dielectric tunability for the design of enhanced subwavelength optical cavities operating in the NIR and visible regions. In particular, we show that discontinuous near-percolation films enable designing optimized cavities for efficient colour generation with a thickness almost 3 times smaller than what was previously achieved for continuous films.

Practical advantages and limitations of each numerical method are compared for modeling electromagnetic scattering of both near-field intensity and the far-field projected intensity, in terms of accuracy, memory, and compute time. When compared with a commercial software implementation of the Yee-lattice finite-difference time domain method, the Born-Rytov scattering approximation and discrete dipole approximation show better agreement with the far-field light scattering pattern from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Consequently, its precise measurement is crucial for numerous applications, including biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and optical communication. Since polarization cannot be measured directly, it is typically inferred by converting it into intensity signals using dedicated optical elements. Conventional approaches, however, predominantly rely on bulky optical components, leading to considerably high fabrication costs and limited integration density. Here, we introduce a passive photonic integrated circuit capable of precisely determining the polarization state of visible free-space light. An silicon nitride on-chip architecture employing a compact polarization-splitting grating coupler and a set of passive interferometers encodes the polarization information into intensity signals, allowing conventional detectors to accurately reconstruct the polarization state. With increasing compactness of photonic components, however, susceptibility to fabrication tolerances as well as intrinsic design constraints increases, potentially leading to non\\-/ideal behaviour. To address this, we introduce a robust calibration procedure that enables precise measurements even in the presence of imperfections. The chip design, combined with the calibration procedure, offers a robust, small-footprint, and high-speed approach to polarimetry, enabling a wide range of applications.         ",

Existing RR monitors often suffer from baseline drift over time, breaths can be occluded by limb or body movements, and many systems struggle to resolve shallow or extreme thoracic motion.

The sensor comprises a fiber cavity whose portion is embedded into a flexible chest binder in a sinusoidal-like pattern, which the patient wears. Thoracic expansion and contraction during breathing modulate the cavity, and RR is extracted through CAPS measurements. Our sensor exhibits high reproducibility, strong sensitivity to strain and pressure induced by chest movements, inherent resistance to baseline drift, and the ability to detect body movements. The system achieves a root-mean-square error of 0.91 breaths per minute relative to the ground truth, across RR values ranging from 8 to 44 breaths per minute, when tested on multiple subjects in various postures, including sitting, supine, prone, and lateral positions.

    "abstract": "           Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a cornerstone of classical scientific computing, and there is growing interest in whether quantum computers can accelerate such simulations. To date, the existing proposals for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for CFD have almost exclusively been based on the Carleman embedding method, used to encode nonlinearities on a quantum computer. In this work, we begin by showing that these proposals suffer from a range of severe bottlenecks that negate conjectured quantum advantages: lack of convergence of the Carleman method, prohibitive time-stepping requirements, unfavorable condition number scaling, and inefficient data extraction. With these roadblocks clearly identified, we develop a novel algorithm for the incompressible lattice Boltzmann equation that circumvents these obstacles, and then provide a detailed analysis of our algorithm, including all potential sources of algorithmic complexity, as well as gate count estimates. We find that for an end-to-end problem, a modest quantum advantage may be preserved for selected observables in the high-error-tolerance regime. We lower bound the Reynolds number scaling of our quantum algorithm in dimension $D$ at Kolmogorov microscale resolution with $O(\\mathrm{Re}^{\\frac{3}{4}(1+\\frac{D}{2})} \\times q_M)$, where $q_M$ is a multiplicative overhead for data extraction with $q_M = O(\\mathrm{Re}^{\\frac{3}{8}})$ for the drag force. This upper bounds the scaling improvement over classical algorithms by $O(\\mathrm{Re}^{\\frac{3D}{8}})$. However, our numerical investigations suggest a lower speedup, with a scaling estimate of $O(\\mathrm{Re}^{1.936} \\times q_M)$ for $D=2$.

However, designing PhCs with prescribed topological properties remains challenging because of the highly nonlinear mapping from the continuous real-space design of PhCs to the discrete output space of band topology. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach to address this problem, employing Kolmogorov--Arnold networks (KANs) to predict and inversely design the band symmetries of two-dimensional PhCs with two-fold rotational (C2) symmetry. We show that a single-hidden-layer KAN, trained on a dataset of C2-symmetric unit cells, achieves high accuracy in classifying the topological classes of the lowest lying bands. We use the symbolic regression capabilities of KANs to extract algebraic formulas that express the topological classes directly in terms of the Fourier components of the dielectric function. These formulas not only retain the full predictive power of the network but also provide novel insights and enable deterministic inverse design. Using this approach, we generate photonic crystals with target topological bands, achieving high accuracy even for high-contrast, experimentally realizable structures beyond the training domain.

    "abstract": "           Emerging applications of photonics in computing, sensing, and security increasingly demand complex input-output behaviors, including highly nonlinear transformations of optical signals. Traditional photonic systems rely on highly structured components with symmetric geometries and low-entropy modal responses to achieve predictable and analytically describable behavior. To achieve expressive functionality, this paradigm often requires large networks of fabrication-sensitive interferometers or resonators and substantial hardware error correction to restore deterministic operation. Here we demonstrate an alternative paradigm rooted in low-symmetry, disordered integrated photonic circuits, which provide intrinsically enhanced modal diversity and spectral complexity, enabling highly nonlinear transformations of input signals into information-rich outputs. Our devices, physically unclonable moire quasicrystal interferometers integrated on a silicon photonics platform, exhibit aperiodic and reconfigurable spectral responses and are characterized by analyticity breaking and erasable mutual information. Using dynamic thermo-optic control to drive their complex spectral dynamics, we demonstrate that these devices function as reconfigurable physical unclonable functions (rPUFs). We also highlight their ability to perform high-dimensional input-output transformations, emulating reservoir-inspired information processing in a compact photonic platform. This work bridges the gap between engineered and natural complexity in photonic systems, revealing new opportunities for scalable, energy-efficient, and information-dense optoelectronics with applications in secure communications, hardware security, advanced sensing, and optical information processing.

Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian shaped radial magnetic field $B_{eff}$ is extracted for Ni isotopes which is shown to be a combination of an axial $B_z$ component and a second contribution $B_{ibw}$ that represents the equivalent of an effective magnetic field contributing to the isotopic separation due to broad spectrum Ion Bernstein Waves providing electrostatic acceleration to the cyclotron orbits. These IBWs are also responsible for a profound resonance of enrichment observed for certain specific charge states. In addition to cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment.

In this paper we focus on a new high-bandwidth frequency multiplexed TES readout system developed for CUPID, a neutrinoless double beta decay experiment that will replace CUORE. In order to achieve the high energy resolution requirements for CUPID, the readout noise of the system must be kept to a minimum. Low TES operating resistance and long wiring between the readout SQUID and the warm electronics are needed for CUPID, prompting a careful consideration of the design parameters of this application of frequency multiplexing. In this work, we characterize the readout noise of the newly designed frequency multiplexed TES readout system for CUPID and construct a noise model to understand it. We find that current sharing between the SQUID coil impedance and other branches of the circuit, as well as the long output wiring, worsen the readout noise of the system. To meet noise requirements, a SQUID with a low input inductance, high transimpedance and/or low dynamic impedance is needed, and the wiring capacitance should be kept as small as possible. Alternatively, the option of adding a cryogenic low-noise amplifier at the output of the SQUID should be explored.         ",

    "title": "High fidelity CNOT gates in photonic integrated circuits using composite segmented directional couplers",
    "abstract": "           Integrated photonic circuits are a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, but their performance is often constrained by component sensitivity to fabrication imperfections. Directional couplers, which are crucial building blocks for integrated quantum logic gates, are particularly prone to such limitations, with strong dependence on geometric and spectral parameters which reduces gate fidelity. Here, we demonstrate that composite segmented directional couplers (CSDC) offer a fabrication-tolerant alternative that enhances gate fidelity without active tuning. We design and fabricate a fully integrated photonic controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate using both uniform and composite coupler variants and compare their performance via simulation, classical characterization, and quantum two-photon interference. The composite design reduces the average error probability by nearly a factor of two and decreases variability fivefold. The residual error is primarily limited by photon indistinguishability. Classical matrix reconstruction confirms improved agreement with the ideal CNOT operation. These results establish CSDCs as compact, passive, and foundry-compatible building blocks for robust scalable quantum photonic circuits.         ",

    "abstract": "           The Goos-H\u00e4nchen (GH) shift becomes giant in resonant photonic structures, making it promising for refractive index sensors with ultimate sensitivities. We provide here a complete formalism to analytically describe the GH shift and its associated sensitivity around the critical coupling regime in photonic structures. This analytical framework quantitatively connects physical parameters such as the quality factor, the angular dispersion, the beam size and the phase singularity to the GH shift. We numerically confirm this theory in two practical designs: a surface plasmon resonance sensor and a Bloch surface wave (BSW) metasurface sensor. Coupling our theory with numerical simulations, we design a BSW metasurface whose GH sensitivity ($10^{13} \\mu m/RIU$) is more than 5 orders of magnitude higher than the current state-of-the this http URL also reveal that the main practical limitation to reach ultimate GH sensitivities is the beam size. However, taking into account realistic beam sizes and introducing engineering dispersion for the metasurface, we calculate limits of detection for GH sensors as low as $10^{-13} RIU$ that still surpass current sensors. These results open the way for new sensing application needing high sensitivity and low limit of detection.         ",

This report presents a framework for the categorization of roles in the QISE industry based on 42 interviews of QISE professionals across 23 companies, as well as a description of the method used in the creation of this framework. The data included information on over 80 positions, which we have grouped into 29 roles spanning four primary categories. For each primary category we provide an overview of what unites the roles within a category, a description of relevant subcategories, and definitions of the individual roles. These roles serve as the basis upon which we generate profiles of these roles, which include information about role critical tasks, necessary knowledge and skills, and educational requirements. Our next report will present such profiles for each of the roles presented herein.         ",

In contrast, the spin angular momentum of non-monochromatic fields remains unexplored. Here, we extend the concept of optical spin to the domain of non-monochromatic electromagnetic fields. Through this formulation, we uncover the precessional dynamics of electromagnetic spin in specific polychromatic configurations, including the superposition of circularly and linearly polarized plane waves propagating orthogonally at different frequencies, as well as fields generated by a precessing magnetic dipole. We discover that the dynamics of the electromagnetic spin in these cases obeys a Landau-Lifshitz-like equation establishing a profound parallel between dynamics of magnetization and photonic spin.

    "abstract": "           Tin perovskites are the most promising environmentally friendly alternative to lead perovskites. Among tin perovskites, FASnI3 (CH4N2SnI3) shows optimum band gap, and easy processability. However, the performance of FASnI3 based solar cells is incomparable to lead perovskites for several reasons, including energy band mismatch between the perovskite absorber film and the charge transporting layers (CTLs) for both types of carriers, i.e., for electrons (ETLs) and holes (HTLs). However, the band diagrams in the literature are inconsistent, and the charge extraction dynamics are poorly understood. In this paper, we study the energy band positions of FASnI3 based perovskites using Kelvin probe (KP) and photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) to provide a precise band diagram of the most used device stack. In addition, we analyze the defects within the current energetic landscape of tin perovskites. We uncover the role of bathocuproine (BCP) in enhancing the electron extraction at the fullerene C60/BCP interface. Furthermore, we used transient surface photovoltage (tr-SPV) for the first time for tin perovskites to understand the charge extraction dynamics of the most reported HTLs such as NiOx and PEDOT, and ETLs such as C60, ICBA, and PCBM. Finally, we used Hall effect, KP, and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) to estimate an accurate value of the p-doping concentration in FASnI3 and showed a consistent result of 1.5 * 1017 cm-3. Our findings prove that the energetic system of tin halide perovskites is deformed and should be redesigned independently from lead perovskites to unlock the full potential of tin perovskites.

Here, we propose a fast and robust single-qubit gate in $^{87}$Sr, utilizing the concept of optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER). ONER exploits the interaction between the quadrupole moment of a nucleus and the electric field gradient generated by its electronic environment, enabling spin level transitions via amplitude-modulated laser light. We investigate the hyperfine structure of the 5s$^2$~$^1S_{0}\\rightarrow{}$~5s5p~$^3P_1$ optical transition in neutral $^{87}$Sr, and identify the magnetic field strengths and laser parameters necessary to drive spin transitions between the $m_I$ = -9/2 and $m_I$ = -5/2 hyperfine levels in the ground state. Our simulations show that ONER could enable faster spin operations compared to the state-of-the-art oscillations in this 'atomic qubit'. Moreover, we show that spin-flip operations exceeding 99.9\\% fidelity can be performed even in the presence of typical noise sources.

Using representative bulk water and air-water interface test cases, we demonstrate the accuracy of the developed framework in infrared spectral simulations. Specifically, by seamlessly integrating non-local charge transfer effects from 4G-HDCNNPs with the NQEs from PI methods, our introduced methodology yields accurate infrared spectra using predicted charges from the 4G-HDCNNP architecture without explicit training of dipole moments.
