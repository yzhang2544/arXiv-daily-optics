    "title": "The Nexus of Quantum Technology, Intellectual Property, and National Security: An LSI Test for Securing the Quantum Industrial Commons",
    "abstract": "           Our world of power and national security is increasingly probabilistic: like a quantum wavefunction, it encodes multiple plausible futures until policy choices and shocks collapse them into observable outcomes. Quantum technologies have moved from laboratory curiosities to strategic infrastructure, with an approaching 'event horizon' reflected in recent United States strategic assessments -- incl. the U.S. --China Economic and Security Review Commission's (USSC) call for a Quantum First posture by 2030- and in parallel White House initiatives aimed at securing critical inputs and accelerating trusted innovation. Government research further documents that China's quantum program is centrally mobilized under military-civil fusion, and that its consequential advantages may arise not only from computing milestones but also from sensing and cryptanalytic applications, thereby sharpening the need for a values based deterrence by denial governance posture. The Article's central claim is that the U.S. and its allies should pursue security-sufficient openness, operationalized through a least-trade-restrictive, security-sufficient, innovation-preserving (LSI) test that disciplines both state and private action. The LSI test integrates emerging instruments of economic statecraft to create secure closed loop enclaves for high-sensitivity collaborative R&D. The Article's contribution is an implementable coalition playbook, offering empirically anchored criteria, templates, and differentiated guardrails -- incl. red zone domains where denial is the default -- to avoid both over-securitization and under-securitization. Properly applied, LSI reduces the risk of a self-defeating Silicon Curtain while establishing standards-first interoperability as a stabilizing eigenstate of the international order and enabling RQT by design to shape trusted adoption pathways beyond the coalition, incl. in the majority world.

    "abstract": "           We incorporate a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) based low-level solver as a means to accelerate the environment-level solver for the recently developed MPCC embedding framework. Using CPD, we both factorize the three dominant order-three density-fitting two-electron integral (DF TEI) tensors and develop a novel formulation that reduces the storage complexity of the low-level solver from $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(NR)$, where $R$ is the CPD rank, and the computational scaling of the most time-consuming contractions from $\\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(NR^2)$. We provide benchmarks on representative chemical environments, namely water clusters $\\mathrm{(H_2O)_n}$ with $n = 1$ to $6$ and linear alkane chains $\\mathrm{C_nH_{2n+2}}$ with $n = 1$ to $6$. For both test sets, using the CPD-compressed DF TEI tensors reproduces the DF reference convergence behavior of the low-level solver, the subsequent high-level step, and the fully self-consistent MPCC iterations, while introducing only small, rank-controlled shifts in absolute energies. At a fixed tolerance in the absolute MPCC energy, the CP ranks required for these tensor approximations increase linearly with system size. Chemically relevant energy differences are likewise preserved, as demonstrated for water-cluster dissociation energies and in a proof-of-concept embedding calculation of methane in a four-water cluster.

    "abstract": "           The rapid growth of quantum information science and technology (QIST) in the 21st century has created both excitement and uncertainty about the field's trajectory. This qualitative study presents perspectives from leading quantum researchers, who are educators, on fundamental questions frequently posed by students, the public, and the media regarding QIST. Through in-depth interviews, we explored several issues related to QIST including the following key areas: the current state of quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era and timelines for fault-tolerant quantum computers, the feasibility of personal quantum computers in our pockets, and promising qubit architectures for future development. Our findings reveal diverse yet convergent perspectives on these issues. While experts agree that the current machines with physical qubits that are being built currently should be called quantum computers, most estimated that it will take a decade to build a small fault-tolerant quantum computer, and several decades to achieve scalable systems capable of running Shor's factoring algorithm with quantum advantage. Regarding carrying a quantum computer in the pocket, experts viewed quantum computers as specialized tools that will remain in central locations such as data centers and can be accessed remotely for applications for which they are particularly effective compared to classical computers. Quantum researchers suggested that multiple platforms show promise, with no clear winner emerging. These insights provide valuable guidance for educators, policymakers, and the broader community in establishing realistic expectations for developments in this exciting field. Our findings can provide valuable information for educators to clarify student doubts about these important yet confusing issues related to quantum technologies.         ",

    "abstract": "           The rapid advancement of quantum information science and technology (QIST) has generated significant attention from people in academia, industry, and the public. Recent advances in QIST have led to both opportunities and challenges for students and researchers who are curious about the potential of the field amid hype, considering whether their skills are aligned with what the field needs, and contemplating how collaborating with industries may impact their research. This qualitative study presents perspectives from leading quantum researchers who are educators on three critical aspects shaping QIST's development: (1) the impact of hype in the field and strategies for managing expectations, (2) approaches to creating conducive environments that attract students and established researchers from non-physics disciplines, and (3) effective models for fostering university-industry partnerships that can be valuable for students and researchers alike. These aspects, along with several interconnected challenges, were explored through in-depth interviews with quantum educators. Our findings reveal nuanced perspectives on managing the hype cycle and its risks in creating unrealistic expectations. Regarding greater interdisciplinary engagement and attracting more non-physicists to QIST, educators emphasized the need to recognize and leverage existing expertise from other fields while developing educational pathways that meet diverse student backgrounds to prepare them for the QIST workforce. On university-industry partnerships, respondents highlighted successful models, while noting persistent challenges around intellectual property, confidentiality, and differing organizational goals. These insights provide valuable guidance for educators, policymakers, and industry leaders working to build a sustainable quantum workforce while maintaining realistic expectations about the field's trajectory.

    "abstract": "           Tunable, low-loss, narrowband, and frequency-stabilized filters play a critical role in the realization of transceivers for efficient signal processing in telecommunications and sensing applications in the presence of strong interference and noise. We systematically design, fabricate, and demonstrate multi-cavity, multipole integrated photonic bandpass filters with gigahertz to sub-gigahertz bandwidths. The filters feature ultra-wideband tunable center frequencies exceeding 400 GHz, ultra-low insertion loss, steep roll-off, and compact footprints, making them suitable for radio-frequency, microwave, and millimeter-wave front-end applications. Using a set of design principles for multi-cavity high-order filters together with supporting nanofabrication techniques in a silicon nitride platform, the demonstrated filters achieve record-high figures of merit and advance the state of the art in integrated photonic filtering for radio-frequency, microwave, and millimeter-wave systems. The resonator structures, which are the key building blocks enabling the reported performance, combine a large free spectral range of approximately 70 GHz with a high quality factor of 2.1 times ten to the power of seven. This performance is enabled by combining wide multimode waveguide segments with narrow single-mode regions connected through adiabatic tapers. To the best of our knowledge, the experimentally demonstrated bandwidth of 520 MHz, tuning range of one free spectral range, filter insertion loss of 2 dB, and out-of-band rejection ratios of up to 55 dB represent record performance metrics for integrated photonic filtering of radio-frequency, millimeter-wave, and terahertz signals.

    "abstract": "           Multiple scattering of waves in complex media can be harnessed and tailored for diverse phenomena in sound and light. Despite the tremendous progress enabled by technologies such as time-reversal propagation and wavefront shaping, the full control of transmission matrix remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a multi-scattering-based approach to design reflectionless complex media with a unitary transmission matrix of arbitrary structures. As such, the perfect transmission of waves through such a medium performs a unitary operation. Based on this principle, we experimentally demonstrated braiding of multiple waveguide modes in an acoustic waveguide via multiple scattering and showed non-Abelian characteristics arising from the concatenation of distinct complex media. Furthermore, we show that the principle can be extended for realizing arbitrary unitary operations beyond braiding. Our scheme uses generalized Wigner-Smith operators to design the optimal acoustic complex media with near-arbitrary targeted functionalities. The scheme is generally applicable beyond acoustics, with broad implications to other wave types. Our results demonstrate unprecedented control over multiple-scattering waves and are relevant to applications that require precise control over propagation, such as multiplexed communications, wave-based logic operations, and computations.

We compute the electronic eigenstates in the presence of a sharply focused Gaussian laser beam, and find strong Rydberg state mixing leading to large kilo-Debye dipole moments. These can be modulated with high bandwidth controlled by the local tweezer intensity. Oscillations in the position-dependent level shifts, analogous to the potential wells allowing ultralong-range Rydberg molecules to form, provide opportunities to trap the Rydberg atom in an eccentric way via ponderomotive forces acting on sub-orbital length scales.

    "abstract": "           Recent advances in photonic inverse design have demonstrated the ability to automatically synthesize compact, high-performance photonic components that surpass conventional, hand-designed structures, offering a promising path toward scalable and functionality-rich photonic hardware. However, the practical deployment of inverse-designed PICs is bottlenecked by manufacturability: their irregular, subwavelength geometries are highly sensitive to fabrication variations, leading to large performance degradation, low yield, and a persistent gap between simulated optimality and fabricated performance. Unlike electronics, photonics lacks a systematic, flexible mask optimization flow. Fabrication deviations in photonic components cause large optical response drift and compounding error in cascaded circuits, while calibrating fabrication models remains costly and expertise-heavy, often requiring repeated fabrication cycles that are inaccessible to most designers. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRISM, a photonics-informed inverse lithography workflow that makes photonic mask optimization data-efficient, reliable, and optics-informed. PRISM (i) synthesizes compact, informative calibration patterns to minimize required fabrication data, (ii) trains a physics-grounded differentiable fabrication model, enabling gradient-based optimization, and (iii) performs photonics-informed inverse mask optimization that prioritizes performance-critical features beyond geometry matching. Across multiple inverse-designed components with both electron-beam lithography and deep ultra-violet photolithography processes, PRISM significantly boosts post-fabrication performance and yield while reducing calibration area and turnaround time, enabling and democratizing manufacturable and high-yield inverse-designed photonic hardware at scale.

    "abstract": "           Microwave synthesizers are central to test and measurement systems across applications including wireless communications, radar, spectroscopy, and time and frequency metrology. State-of-the-art microwave sources, however, are fundamentally constrained by trade-offs between frequency tunability and spectral purity. Electro-optic frequency division (eOFD) is an emerging technique for dividing down the purity of optical sources to the microwave domain. Previously reported eOFD-based synthesizers generally have limited tunability due to feedback stabilization requirements. Here we demonstrate a feed-forward eOFD architecture in which the frequency tunability of a microwave source is preserved while optical spectral purity is divided through feed-forward cancellation, without any downstream electronic frequency synthesis. By canceling the phase noise of the microwave source without feedback, this eOFD approach removes loop bandwidth and source noise constraints observed in prior eOFD architectures. We achieve octave-spanning tunability, including the entire X-band, with phase noise below -140 dBc/Hz at kilohertz offsets and a high-frequency noise floor between -155 dBc/Hz and -145 dBc/Hz for carrier frequencies from 8 to 16 GHz. This performance corresponds to single-femtosecond integrated timing jitter, enabling, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of coherent, optically referenced microwave synthesis under wide tuning with this level of spectral purity.

The high non-degeneracy means the photon pairs are far-detuned from Raman noise, resulting in a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio even while operating at room temperature. The source produces two spectrally and spatially distinct phase-matched processes with low spectral cross-talk, distinct transverse spatial modes in the NIR, and a single fundamental spatial mode in the telecommunication range.

Those structures exhibit novel photonic properties unattainable with traditional photonic crystals. Especially, moir\u00e9 magic configurations have been shown to allow intriguing slow light modes with zero group velocity. Starting from macroscopic moir\u00e9 patterns in the everyday life, we will then shift to the subwavelength scale of moir\u00e9 photonic crystals and detail some of their unusual properties.

    "abstract": "           Newton's constant is the least well-measured among the fundamental constants of Nature, and, indeed, its accurate measurement has long served an experimental challenge. Levitated mechanical systems are attracting growing attention for their promising applications in sensing and as an experimental platform for exploring the intersection between quantum physics and gravitation. Here we propose a mechanical interferometric scheme of interacting levitated oscillators for the accurate estimation of Newton's constant. Our scheme promises to beat the current standard by several orders of magnitude.         ",

    "abstract": "           Trapped atomic ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation, computation, and metrology, offering long coherence times and precise, individual control over both internal and motional degrees of freedom. In this review, we present a pedagogical introduction to trapped-ion systems, covering the physics of ion trapping, qubit encodings, and laser-ion interactions. We explain how spin-dependent forces generated by light fields enable both analog and digital quantum simulations of spin and spin-boson models, as well as high-fidelity quantum logic gates. We then highlight an emerging frontier in the simulation of chemical dynamics, summarizing recent experiments that demonstrate the capability of trapped ions to simulate vibronic models and excitation-transfer processes. Finally, we outline future directions in quantum simulation and discuss open challenges in scaling up trapped-ion architectures.         ",

    "title": "Electropolishing-Induced Topographic Defects in Niobium: Insights and Implications for Superconducting Radio Frequency Applications",
    "abstract": "           Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.         ",

    "abstract": "           Scalable solid state single-photon sources (SPSs) with triggered single-photon emission rates exceeding a few GHz would aid in the wide technological adoption of photonic quantum technologies. We demonstrate triggering of a quantum dot (QD) single photon emission using dynamic Purcell effect induced at a frequency of several GHz by acoustic strain. To this end, InAs QDs are integrated in a hybrid photon-phonon patterned microcavity, where the density of optical states is tailored by the lateral confinement of photons in um-sized traps defined lithographically in the microcavity spacer. The single-photon character of the emission form a QD in a trap is confirmed by measuring single-photon statistics. We demonstrate modulation of the QD transition energy in a trap with a frequency up to 14 GHz by monochromatic longitudinal bulk acoustic phonons generated by piezoelectric transducers. For the modulation frequency of 5.6 GHz, corresponding to the acoustic mode of the microcavity, the QD energy is periodically shifted through a spectrally narrow confined photonic mode leading to an appreciable enhancement of the QD emission due to the dynamic Purcell effect. The platform thus enables the implementation of scalable III-V-based SPSs with on-chip tunable acoustic clocks with frequencies that can exceed several GHz under continuous wave optical excitation.

    "abstract": "           The phenomena of induced transparency, with the typical examples of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in atomic media and coupled optical resonators, have attracted tremendous interest since their discoveries. Due to the limitations of the involved elements, however, near-100\\% transmissions were reported under highly demanding experimental conditions for atomic and other media. Based on a structure of three linearly coupled optical resonators, an active one carrying a possibly arbitrary optical gain and two passive ones simply with dissipation, we demonstrate that a transmitted light field can become completely transparent through the structure, which displays all properties similar to those of EIT. A destructive interference mechanism is discovered to totally eliminate the intracavity field in the resonator directly coupled to the transmitted field of any feasible power, when the coupling strength of two other resonators is tuned to a point inside the designed range. This mechanism works for all possible coupling strengths of the dark resonator with its neighboring resonator and the input field, as well as for any available quality factor from its fabrication. The transparency window size and the output field intensity at the transparency window center can be freely engineered by adjusting two inter-cavity couplings, without modifying the built-in optical gain which can be just slightly stronger than the dissipation of the active resonator.
