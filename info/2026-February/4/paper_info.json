    "abstract": "           Hyperuniform metasurfaces promise an unusual form of wave control: the suppression of elastic scattering over extended angular ranges without periodic order. Here, we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of 2D stealthy hyperuniform metasurfaces operating at optical frequencies. In agreement with theoretical expectations, we observe a pronounced reduction of elastic scattering around the specular direction in metasurfaces fabricated by electron-beam lithography. However, the measured suppression is substantially weaker than that predicted by structure-factor calculations based on ideal stealthy hyperuniform point-pattern generators. We identify and quantitatively analyze the physical origins of this discrepancy, and establish realistic performance bounds. By isolating the dominant limiting mechanisms, our results provide practical design guidelines for the implementation of stealthy hyperuniform metasurfaces in functional photonic devices.         ",

    "abstract": "           WindBorne Systems has developed a constellation of long-duration atmospheric balloons to collect meteorological data across the globe, filling gaps in current in-situ data collection methods. Each Global Sounding Balloon (GSB) is capable of flying for weeks or months and performing dozens of soundings while measuring pressure, temperature, humidity, and GNSS-derived position, altitude, and wind velocity. This data is transmitted to ground via satellite, processed, and made available within minutes of being collected. The current meteorological sensor package has remained largely unchanged since mid-2024 and has flown on thousands of GSBs totaling over one million hours of flight time. Here we present the design and performance of this sensor package. The custom readout architecture and housing allow for data collection across nearly all in-flight conditions while minimizing sources of bias and noise. Uncertainty is characterized via sounding reproducibility studies and in-house calibration of pressure, humidity, and temperature sensors. The calibration and data processing procedures have been optimized and validated by comparison with external datasets. We present external validation in the form of 1) side-by-side radiosonde launches performed in collaboration with the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, which show agreement within expected uncertainty limits, and 2) intercomparison studies with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5, which show an aggregate root mean square difference of: Geopotential height -- 14 m; Pressure -- 0.36 hPa; Temperature -- 0.91 K; Wind speed u -- 2.45 m/s; Wind speed v -- 2.50 m/s; Relative humidity -- 13%.

    "abstract": "           The miniaturization of mechanical mechanisms is crucial to enable the development of compact, high-performance micromachines. However, the downscaling actuation of conventional gears and micromotors has remained limited by the inherent challenges of implementing mechanical/electrical powering. Here, we present the design, fabrication, and characterization of an optomechanical, gear-driven micromachine realized through two-photon polymerization 3D printing. The actuation is achieved using optical tweezers. The device integrates a microgear transmission system with an optically actuated part, enabling light-controlled micromachines. When illuminated by a highly focused laser source, the first gear generates rotational torque within the gear assembly, converting optical energy into directional mechanical work that can be transmitted to the coupled gear. We demonstrate the fabrication of micromachines using two-photon polymerization (2PP) laser writing, enabling the fabrication of spur gear trains and bevel gears that can produce out-of-plane rotations, which is not achievable with traditional micromachining fabrication techniques. The micromachines are composed of a single gear or a train of two or three gears without any unwanted adhesion between the components, leading to functioning systems. Experimentally, the fabricated micromachines were actuated using optical tweezers, demonstrating continuous gear rotation, effective motion transmission in gear trains, out-of-plane rotations, and the ability to amplify velocity or torque. Optical-tweezer actuation broadens the potential applications of these micromachines, particularly in biomedical and lab-on-a-chip systems, where precise, minimally invasive control at the microscale is essential.

Here we introduce the bulk acoustic resonator with vertical electrodes (VBAR), a device that combines the advantages of suspended and solidly mounted resonators. VBARs use lithium niobate (LiNbO3) ridges with sidewall electrodes to excite a shear-horizontal bulk acoustic resonance, providing frequency control through lithography in a configuration that is mechanically anchored to the substrate. Fabricated VBARs exhibit electromechanical coupling coefficients exceeding 30% in the 2-4 GHz range, enabling ladder filters with fractional bandwidths of nearly 20%. While further optimization is necessary to minimize losses, the VBAR concept offers an alternative route toward wideband and robust RF filters for next-generation wireless systems.         ",

However, acoustic loss fundamentally limits the performance of acoustic devices on TFLN platforms, yet its physical origin remains insufficiently understood. Here, we systematically investigate acoustic propagation loss in various TFLN platforms, including lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI), lithium niobate on sapphire (LNOS), suspended LN thin films, and bulk LN at gigahertz frequencies over temperatures ranging from 4 K to above room temperature. Using a delay-line method, we extract frequency- and temperature-dependent losses for Rayleigh, shear-horizontal, and Lamb modes. We observe an anomalous non-monotonic temperature dependence in LNOI that closely resembles acoustic loss in amorphous materials, indicating a dominant loss channel associated with the buried oxide layer at low temperatures. At elevated temperatures, the loss converges to the Akhiezer damping governed by phonon-phonon interactions. High-resolution electron microscopy further reveals nanoscale interfacial crystal impurities that may contribute to the increased acoustic loss in TFLN platforms relative to bulk LN. These results elucidate the acoustic loss mechanisms in TFLN and provide guidelines for designing low-loss acoustic devices.         ",

For both continuous and pulsed beams, the beam energy spread is fundamentally limited by the electron source, and is typically a sizable fraction of an electron-volt. In this paper, we present a means to reduce electron beam energy spread after emission to the level of a few 10s of meV rms using femtosecond photoemission and an interaction with laser-derived single- to few-cycle terahertz (THz) radiation. We show analytically and in particle tracking simulations that this interaction can remove energy spread stored in both the transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom. We analytically formulate the limit of energy spread that this technique can achieve, and map the non-ideal affects arising at high frequencies. The interaction is mediated by the beam's passage through a mirror which is reflective to terahertz radiation but allows transmission of the majority of the electron beam (e.g. a wire mesh). This method then only requires beam current losses of a few tens of percent, far smaller than what is achieved in prism and slit-based electron monochromators.         ",

While optical systems provide a controlled setting for studying these phenomena, achieving deterministic control over their generation remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to induce and precisely modulate extreme events in a semiconductor VCSEL using polarization-controlled optical feedback. By integrating a $\\lambda$/2-waveplate into a polarization-selective external cavity, we regulate the nonlinear interaction between TE and TM modes. This setup triggers high-intensity, heavy-tailed fluctuations in the TM mode, exhibiting clear signatures of extreme events. We show that these events arise from deterministic energy exchange between modes, as evidenced by strong bipolar correlations and long-range temporal memory. The waveplate angle serves as an effective external parameter, enabling non-monotonic tuning of the event rate, intensity, and temporal clustering. Our study establish a platform for exploring extreme events in dissipative systems, with implications for nonlinear photonics and optical technologies.         ",

    "abstract": "           Narrowband perfect absorbers are interesting for spectrum sensing, molecular detection, and infrared imaging. However, their design remains constrained by intuitive, iterative methods that lack flexibility, while also facing challenges in multi-objective optimization. Here, we introduce a deep learning-enabled inverse-design framework that overcomes these limitations through a conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). The main contribution of this work is a dual-channel image encoding scheme that jointly represents the geometry and thickness of a Si$_3$N$_4$ meta-layer, facilitating the network to learn the distribution of viable structures for a target optical response. This approach naturally solves the inherent ``one-to-many'' design issue, giving a diverse portfolio of functional candidates from a single input spectrum. The designed absorbers achieve exceptional spectral fidelity, with resonance peak errors below 5 nm, a mean squared error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, and the capacity to produce over 10 distinct, high-performance designs per target. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's robustness under oblique illumination, showing that it can be efficiently fine-tuned to maintain spectral accuracy across incidence angles from $10^\\circ$ to $40^\\circ$ by transfer learning, thus extending its practical utility to non-normal operating conditions. Full-wave simulations confirm that the generated geometries support a hybrid plasmonic-dielectric resonance, leading to near-perfect absorption and strong near-field enhancement. Our study provides a robust, physics-aware design paradigm that moves beyond conventional parametric optimization. The introduced framework establishes a versatile platform for the on-demand inverse design of advanced photonic devices for sensing, spectroscopy, and optical signal processing.         ",

Here, we address these issues experimentally by resolving the trajectory-dependent temporal structure of liquid HHG. By optimizing the laser focusing geometry, we achieve clear spatial discrimination of short- and long-trajectory contributions, providing direct evidence for the existence of multiple quantum trajectories in liquids. Using a phase-controlled two-color driving field, we independently retrieve the attochirp associated with each trajectory and demonstrate opposite energy-time correlations for short and long trajectories, establishing a trajectory-resolved energy-time mapping in liquid HHG. All observations are well reproduced by semiclassical recollision simulations. These results place liquid HHG on the same conceptual footing as gas- and solid-phase HHG and establish a robust foundation for attosecond-resolved spectroscopy of ultrafast electronic and chemical dynamics in liquid environments.

We further establish a universal velocity-product law conserved throughout the passband, $ v_E v_g=\\langle v_{\\rm ph}^2\\rangle_T $, fixing transport solely by the temporal average of the inverse permittivity.

Ultraviolet excitation dynamics in these networks are typically modeled with effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. By extending this approach to a Lindblad master equation that incorporates explicit site geometries and dipole orientations, we track how correlations are generated, routed, and dissipated, while capturing both energy dissipation and information propagation among coupled chromophores. We compare localized injections, fully delocalized preparations, and eigenmode-based initial states. To quantify the emerging quantum-informational structure, we evaluate the $L_1$ norm of coherence, the correlated coherence, and the logarithmic negativity within and between selected chromophore sub-networks. The results reveal a strong dependence of both the direction and persistence of information flow on the type of initial preparation. Superradiant components drive the rapid export of correlations to the environment, whereas subradiant components retain them and slow their leakage. Embedding single tubulin units into larger dimers and spirals reshapes pairwise correlation maps and enables site-selective routing. Scaling to larger ordered lattices strengthens both export and retention channels, whereas static energetic and structural disorder suppresses long-range transport and reduces overall correlation transfer. These findings provide a Lindbladian picture of information flow in cytoskeletal chromophore networks and identify structural and dynamical conditions that transiently preserve nonclassical correlations in microtubules.

To meet the stringent requirements for mechanical stability and high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for electrode quality assurance called GRANITE: Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes. GRANITE is built around a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\\,\\text{m}\\times1.8\\,\\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices. We demonstrate the setup's capabilities in two key areas: first, using laser scanners, we characterize wire tension, and in an independent measurement wire deflection due to gravity and electrostatic forces is determined. The setup achieves a precision of $20\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ for the relative measurement of only electrostatic displacement. Furthermore, GRANITE can measure gravitational sag down to $200\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ in an absolute measurement; this precision improves to $50\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ when applying model-based corrections for systematic effects. The performance achieved exceeds the needs for the characterisation of the electrode sagging in future experiments, which typically aims to ensure a maximal sag on the order of $500\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. Second, we use GRANITE's high resolution camera to image all wires of XENON1T's cathode grid. Subsets of these images are then hand sorted and used to train an autoencoder, to reliably classify wire images as either pristine wires or images containing severe anomalous features. These anomalies appear e.g. as staining and may be potential defects. The interpretation of the classification results is complicated by the fact that most wire segments are not spotless, but show a varying amount of anomalous features. Follow-up studies are needed to identify the exact nature of such features on wires.         ",

    "title": "Integrated Sliding-Short/Probe Tuner with Doorknob Transition for High-Q Cavities",
    "abstract": "           We present an integrated three-knob tuner that internalizes impedance matching inside the launch adapter of a waveguide-fed, high-$Q$ cavity. The tuner combines a waveguide sliding short, a doorknob transition, and a micrometer-driven adjustable coaxial probe. A transmission-line/ABCD model is derived that maps the three mechanical degrees of freedom to the electrical objectives $\\Gamma \\rightarrow 0$, $\\beta$, and $Q_{\\rm L}$, explicitly including the fused-silica feedthrough capacitance. The model yields closed-form matching conditions and predicts the critical-coupling set. Full-wave FEM simulations and bench measurements validate the approach: with $h \\approx 0.55$~mm and backshort distance $\\approx 0.80$~mm, the return loss reaches $|S_{11}| \\approx -30$~dB near 17.8--18.1~GHz while sustaining peak electric fields of $\\sim 1.8 \\times 10^5$~V/m at the nozzle (normalized to 1~W). The measured through loss of the launch assembly is $|S_{21}| \\approx 0.7$--$0.8$~dB at resonance. A parametric study shows that backshort lengths $L_{\\rm {bs}} \\geq 0.5 \\lambda_{\\rm g}$ excite a parasitic stub resonance, introducing a second $S_{11}$ minimum and localizing energy behind the doorknob; keeping $L_{\\rm {bs}} \\leq 0.4 \\lambda_g$ avoids this. In helium plasma discharges at $P_{\\rm {in}} = 10$~W, \\textit{in-situ} retuning of the short and probe maintained a favorable match as the plasma impedance evolved, increasing absorbed power from $\\sim 43\\%$ to $\\sim 76\\%$ while increasing helium propellant flow rate from 25 to 351~sccm. The compact tuner eliminates external stub boxes and generalizes to other waveguide-coupled resonators and plasma sources.         ",

Quantifying the angular trap stiffness is essential for interpreting the rotational dynamics of probe particles. While methods to determine trap stiffness are well established for translational degrees of freedom, angular trapping is often treated analogously even though rotational and translational motions are sensitive to distinct experimental parameters and offer separate insights. This work details passive analysis techniques for determining the angular trap stiffness within the linear restoring torque model and examines the influence of several factors unique to rotational optical tweezers. We show that the parameters of an ancillary measurement beam can be tuned to minimise its influence on angular trapping dynamics, providing necessary improvements for nanoparticle-scale analysis. We also explore the combined effects of shape-induced and material birefringence in spheroidal vaterite probes, and present a framework for assessing hydrodynamic and inertial contributions.

    "abstract": "           The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light provides an unbounded set of orthogonal modes for ultrahigh-capacity optical information processing. However, current OAM detection schemes typically rely on light interference or diffraction, which require bulky optical components and pose a major obstacle to on-chip integration. Here, we demonstrate a fully integrated silicon-based photodetector that enables direct electrical detection of light OAM. This photodetector can resolve vortex beams with topological charges from m = -9 to 9, achieving a record-high mode number resolution among on-chip devices. By integrating plasmonic gratings onto the device electrodes, incident vortex beams can be converted into surface plasmon polaritons with OAM-dependent splitting angles, which in turn produce photocurrents that vary monotonically with the OAM order. Further incorporation of a surface dielectric lens can enhance mode resolution, and a split-electrode architecture enables OAM chirality discrimination. Owing to its CMOS-compatibility and spectral scalability, this platform provides a compact and robust solution for integrated OAM detection, opening new opportunities for on-chip optical communication and computing systems based on structured light.

    "abstract": "           Optical resonances in nanostructures enable strong enhancement of nonlinear processes at the nanoscale, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), with high-$Q$ modes providing intensified light--matter interactions and sharp spectral selectivity for applications in filtering, sensing, and nonlinear spectroscopy. Thanks to the recent advances in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) technology, these key features can be now translated to lithium niobate for realizing novel nanoscale nonlinear optical platforms. Here, we demonstrate a large-area metasurface, realized by scalable nanoimprint lithography, comprising a slanted titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) nanograting on etchless TFLN for efficient narrowband SHG. This is enabled by the optimal coupling of quasi-bound state in the continuum (q-BIC) modes with a narrowband pulsed laser pump. The demonstrated normalized SHG efficiency is $0.15\\%\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{GW}$, which is among the largest reported for LN metasurfaces. The low pump peak intensity ($3.64~\\mathrm{kW}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$) employed, which enables SHG even by continuous-wave pumping, allows envisioning integrated and portable photonic applications. SHG wavelength tuning from $870$ to $920~\\mathrm{nm}$ with stable output power as well as polarization control is also achieved by off-normal pump illumination. This versatile platform opens new opportunities for sensing, THz generation and detection, and ultrafast electro-optic modulation of nonlinear optical signals.         ",

As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state (\\textit{s}-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. We show that the parameterization enables accurate simulations with fewer variational parameters, independent of time-step resolution. Furthermore, the smooth neural quantum state also allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.

This paper develops a unified theory-numerics framework to compute angle-resolved far-field two-photon correlations from arbitrary lossless dielectric scatterers. We describe the input-output relation using a multi-channel scattering formulation that maps two populated incident channels to two selected far-field detection modes, yielding a compact two-channel transfer relation for second-order correlation function and time-domain coincidence counts. The required transfer coefficients are extracted from classical far-field complex amplitudes computed by an fast Fourier transform-accelerated volume integral equation solver, avoiding perfectly matched layers and near-to-far-field post-processing. The method is validated against analytical results for dielectric spheres and demonstrated on a polarization-converting Pancharatnam-Berry-phase metasurface, revealing strong angular dependence of quantum interference and its direct impact on HOM-dip visibility. The framework provides an efficient and physically transparent tool for structure-dependent quantum-correlation analysis, with potential applications in scatterers-enabled quantum state engineering and quantum inverse design.

While following the LOCC protocol structure of earlier proposals, we show that decoding key bits via local charge rather than energy provides exact bit symmetry and enhanced robustness: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.         ",

    "abstract": "           A density functional theory (DFT) framework is presented that links functional derivatives of free-energy functionals to non-linear static density response functions in quantum many-body systems. Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $\\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $\\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions.         ",
