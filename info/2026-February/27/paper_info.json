    "abstract": "           The next generation of particle physics experiments will face a new era of challenges in data acquisition, due to unprecedented data rates and volumes along with extreme environments and operational constraints. Harnessing this data for scientific discovery demands real-time inference and decision-making, intelligent data reduction, and efficient processing architectures beyond current capabilities. Crucial to the success of this experimental paradigm are several emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) and silicon microelectronics, and the advent of quantum algorithms and processing. Their intersection includes areas of research such as low-power and low-latency devices for edge computing, heterogeneous accelerator systems, reconfigurable hardware, novel codesign and synthesis strategies, readout for cryogenic or high-radiation environments, and analog computing. This white paper presents a community-driven vision to identify and prioritize research and development opportunities in hardware-based ML systems and corresponding physics applications, contributing towards a successful transition to the new data frontier of fundamental science.

We first address the propagation of Kelvin waves, helicoidal excitations propagating along the filament, and measure their dispersion relation which turns out to be in good agreement with the original Lord Kelvin predictions. Then, inspired by the connection between vortex line dynamics and an integrable system, we show numerically the existence of solitons propagating along vortex filaments and study the collision of two of such structures. Finally, we show numerically the experimental feasibility of studying vortex solitons in the lab, by proposing an experiment for their generation.         ",

    "abstract": "           Photonic neuromorphic computing promises revolutionary advances in parallel and high-speed processing, yet a key challenge persists: co-integrating nonlinearity, dense connectivity, and intrinsic memory monolithically to enable brain-inspired, spatiotemporal information processing. Here, we overcome this challenge by introducing a monolithic photonic recurrent network based on an active metasurface operating at bound state in the continuum (BIC). The BIC mode mediates strong,long-range coupling across the lattice, creating a reconfigurable recurrent network topology in hardware. Concurrently, the gain medium provides both optical nonlinearity for neuronal activation and a finite carrier lifetime that serves as a built in, analog temporal memory. This synergy enables computation to emerge directly from the collective spatiotemporal dynamics of the driven-dissipative photonic system, effectively realizing a physical reservoir computer on a chip. We experimentally validate a minimal yet physically complete system on benchmark tasks: brain MRI image classification and human action recognition, achieving 92.16% and 85.36% accuracies, respectively. This work establishes a scalable pathway toward ultrafast, energy-efficient neuromorphic intelligence where processing is an inherent property of tailored light matter interaction.         ",

    "abstract": "           Virtual beam diagnostics relies on computationally intensive beam dynamics simulations where high-dimensional charged particle beams evolve through the accelerator. We propose Latent Evolution Model (LEM), a hybrid machine learning framework with an autoencoder that projects high-dimensional phase spaces into lower-dimensional representations, coupled with transformers to learn temporal dynamics in the latent space. This approach provides a common foundational framework addressing multiple interconnected challenges in beam diagnostics. For \\textit{forward modeling}, a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) encodes 15 unique projections of the 6D phase space into a latent representation, while a transformer predicts downstream latent states from upstream inputs. For \\textit{inverse problems}, we address two distinct challenges: (a) predicting upstream phase spaces from downstream observations by utilizing the same CVAE architecture with transformers trained on reversed temporal sequences along with aleatoric uncertainty quantification, and (b) estimating RF settings from the latent space of the trained LEM using a dedicated dense neural network that maps latent representations to RF parameters. For \\textit{tuning problems}, we leverage the trained LEM and RF estimator within a Bayesian optimization framework to determine optimal RF settings that minimize beam loss. This paper summarizes our recent efforts and demonstrates how this unified approach effectively addresses these traditionally separate challenges.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum noise limits the sensitivity of optical measurements, but squeezed states of light enable quantum-enhanced metrology, sensing, and information processing. Most on-chip squeezed-light sources rely on Kerr ($\\chi^{(3)}$) nonlinearities, remain limited by pump power and excess loss constraints. Quadratic ($\\chi^{(2)}$) platforms instead provide stronger parametric interactions, lower pump power requirements, and greater spectral engineering flexibility. Here, we demonstrate strong, broadband squeezed-light generation on a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chip using a dual-resonant optical parametric amplifier implemented in a single periodically poled LN (PPLN) microresonator. Near-full-depth domain inversion is achieved simultaneously with highly over-coupled resonances, exhibiting escape efficiencies exceeding 90% and intrinsic quality factors above 2.5 million in a 0.6 mm$^2$ X-cut TF-PPLN resonator, enabling efficient squeezing at 1587 nm when pumped at 793.5 nm. Operating in the continuous-wave regime, we directly measure -0.81 dB of squeezing below the shot-noise limit with a pump power of 27 mW, together with +4.29 dB of anti-squeezing. From these measurements, we infer an on-chip squeezing level of -7.52 dB $\\pm$ 0.22 dB (95% confidence interval: [-7.96,-7.10] dB), and an on-chip anti-squeezing level of +9.62 dB $\\pm$ 0.25 dB. We demonstrate single-mode squeezing at degeneracy with a squeezed-light spectrum exceeding 10.3 THz. This work reports the highest squeezing ratio among integrated $\\chi^{(2)}$ cavity platforms and the first quasi-phase matched, fully resonant $\\chi^{(2)}$ cavity squeezer on chip, establishing a scalable route to fully integrated power-efficient squeezed-light sources for quantum-enhanced sensing and metrology.

    "abstract": "           This study experimentally, numerically, and theoretically investigates the cavity/bubble dynamics and radiated acoustics during the water entry of a centimeter-scale cylindrical projectile with a conical nose. Experiments were conducted in a laboratory tank, employing synchronized high-speed imaging and hydrophone measurements to characterize the cavity closure modes and their resultant acoustic signatures across a range of Froude numbers. The acoustic signal features a weak radiated signal upon impact, followed by significant pressure oscillations spanning more than 20 cycles in the flow field after cavity elongation and pinch-off. A numerical model based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM) successfully captures these physical processes. Subsequently, a semi-theoretical model that incorporates the projectile's boundary effect is developed from potential flow theory. The model not only yields a dominant cavity oscillation frequency that agrees well with experimental data, but also reveals that the boundary effect leads to a cavity oscillation frequency markedly higher than the Minnaert frequency of an equivalent-volume ellipsoidal bubble containing an internal rigid core. The dominant cavity frequency falls nearly linearly with Fr, governed by nose geometry and projectile inertia. This study clarifies the underlying physics connecting cavity dynamics during water entry to underwater acoustic radiation.         ",

A flexible setup combining spectral and phase shaping of both pump and local oscillator fields with frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection is employed to examine how intracavity dispersion influences squeezing. Different cavity configurations with varying finesse and dispersion conditions are studied, and the squeezing is measured as a function of pump power and local oscillator bandwidth. Contrary to expectations based on existing theoretical models, the measured squeezing levels remain essentially unchanged as dispersion varies. To account for these observations, a modeling approach is introduced in which intracavity dispersion is described as an effective spectral filtering occurring at the stage of SPOPO supermode generation. Within this framework, the filtering is incorporated directly into the interaction Hamiltonian of the nonlinear process. This perspective establishes a consistent experimental benchmark for the study of dispersion in SPOPOs and underscores the importance of spectral filtering in the interpretation of multimode squeezing experiments.

While proposed decades ago, we demonstrate the first experimental realization of a new class of designer nonlinear materials that leverage the interband optical transition in asymmetric structures to provide strong second order susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$. Using simple AlGaAs/GaAs coupled quantum wells operating in the near-infrared as a prototype, we observed strong second harmonic generation enhancement of 1550 nm to 775 nm over bulk controls. Extracted $\\chi^{(2)}$ values were as high as 2750 pm/V, which is $>$7x that of bulk GaAs. Furthermore, measured susceptibilities agreed well with quantum mechanical calculations of $\\chi^{(2)}$ using layer profiles extracted from electron microscopy. Growth interruptions were employed to improve interfacial abruptness in response to electron microscopy characterization, resulting in increased $\\chi^{(2)}$ toward the simulation predictions for ideal heterointerfaces. More complex layer designs showed predicted $\\chi^{(2)}$ up to 7 nm/V. Such materials are anticipated to find myriad applications, including entangled photon generation at telecommunications wavelengths for chipscale quantum information processing.         ",

Our main findings are: (i) that the green MOT configuration is able to trap 10 times more atoms in the blue MOT than using the green transition merely as a repump, and (ii) that the atom numbers in the two-color MOT can be balanced through experimental control parameters. The interest of this scheme lies in its capability of reaching low temperature and its suitability for continuous atomic beam generation.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum state transfer is the primitive of transporting an unknown state on one site of a lattice to another. Using power-law interactions, recent state transfer protocols achieve speedup by utilizing the intermediate ancilla sites. However, these protocols require the ancillas to be in a perfectly initialized state, which, due to noise or imperfect control, may not be the case. In this work we introduce the $\\textit{robustness}$ of a state transfer protocol, which quantifies the protocol's tolerance to error in the initial ancilla state. In the Heisenberg picture, state transfer grows operators supported on the final site such that they no longer commute with all operators on the starting site. We prove that this robustness tightly bounds the Schatten $p$-norms of these commutators between initial and final-site operators. This generalizes the known cases of $p=\\infty$ and $p=2$, which govern completely state-dependent and state-independent state transfer respectively, demonstrating that intermediate values of $p$ govern partially state-dependent state transfer. In conjunction with existing power-law light cones, our result gives new minimum runtimes for partially state-dependent protocols which, in certain regimes, are parametrically better than existing bounds. We introduce new robust state transfer protocols, charting the landscape between complete state-dependence and state-independence.         ",

It is commonly viewed as inducing an intrinsic hierarchy among incompatible observables: some sets of quantum properties are fundamentally more incompatible than others, as quantified by the maximal sharpness permitting their joint measurement. We show that this hierarchy ceases to be absolute in the multi-copy regime. Analyzing qubit spin observables, we prove a No-Comparison Theorem establishing that no global ordering of incompatible observable sets is preserved across all finite-copy configurations. In particular, two sets of observables can exhibit reversed complementarity ordering depending solely on whether the available resources are arranged as identical copies or as parallel-antiparallel pairs. Thus, the degree of quantum incompatibility is not an intrinsic property of observables alone but depends on the global configuration of the prepared quantum probes. Our results uncover a configuration-dependent structure of complementarity, reveal a subtle role of entanglement in shaping the structure of measurement limitations, and call for a reassessment of quantum information protocols under finite resources.

This review presents a unified perspective on these developments based on sheaf-theoretic and graph-theoretic frameworks, which provide theory-independent characterizations of statistical correlations. These approaches clarify the structural relationship between contextuality and nonlocality, facilitate the formulation of experimentally testable inequalities, and guide implementations in realistic physical platforms, with particular emphasis on photonic systems.

A potential mitigation strategy involves utilising ventilation systems, which process large volumes of indoor and outdoor air and remove particulate pollutants through filtration. However, the integration of catalytic technologies with filters in ventilation systems remains underexplored, despite their potential to simultaneously remove particulate matter and gases, as seen in flue gas treatment and automotive exhaust systems. In this study, we develop a predictive, long-wave model for V-shaped filters, with and without separators. The model, validated against experimental and numerical data, provides a framework for enhancing flow rates by increasing fibre diameter and porosity while reducing aspect ratio and filter thickness. These changes lead to increased permeability, which lowers energy requirements. However, they also reduce the pollutant removal efficiency, highlighting the trade-off between flow, filtration performance and operational costs. Leveraging the long-wave model alongside experimental results, we estimate the maximum potential removal rate ($4.5\\times10^{-3}$ GtPM$_{2.5}$, $6.4\\times10^{-3}$ GtNO$_{\\text{x}}$, $2.0\\times10^{-2}$ GtCH$_{4}$ per year; $1.6\\times10^{0}$ GtCO$_{2}$e per year, 20-year GWP for CH$_4$) and minimum cost (\\$$3.4\\times10^{3}$ per tNO$_{\\text{x}}$, \\$$1.1\\times10^{3}$ per tCH$_{4}$; \\$$1.3\\times10^{1}$ per tCO$_{2}$e) if a billion V-shaped filters integrated with catalytic enhancements were deployed in operation.

Although machine learning provides a promising alternative to conventional simulation techniques, most existing models employ real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) that inherently mismatch the complex-valued nature of quantum mechanics. By decoupling the real and imaginary parts of the density matrix, RVNNs can obscure essential amplitude-phase correlations, compromising physical consistency. Here, we introduce complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) as a physics-consistent framework for learning quantum dissipative dynamics. CVNNs operate directly on complex-valued inputs, preserve the algebraic structure of quantum states, and naturally encode quantum coherences. Through numerical benchmarks on the spin-boson model and several variants of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, we demonstrate that CVNNs outperform RVNNs in convergence speed, training stability, and physical fidelity -- including significantly improved trace conservation and Hermiticity. These advantages increase with system size and coherence complexity, establishing CVNNs as a robust, scalable, quantum-aware classical approach for simulating open quantum systems in the pre-fault-tolerant quantum era.

Going beyond the Chern-number-based paradigms, quantized transports can also arise from k-direction quasienergy winding unique to periodically driven (Floquet) systems, which are free of dimensionality and adiabaticity limitations. However, lattices displaying winding of their quasienergy bands require asymmetric long-range couplings that are difficult to achieve in lattices of real-space coupled sites. Here, by leveraging photonic synthetic dimensions we construct asymmetric long-range-couplings in a one-dimensional temporal quantum walk based on three coupled fiber loops. We demonstrate quantized transport arising from the winding of quasienergy bands in k direction. We show that the average group velocity of an initial wave packet is proportional to the winding number, which leads to a quantized transport displacement. To better visualize this quantized displacement, we cascade two regions with flipped nearest/long-range couplings and observe a focusing effect with a quantized spatial shift in the focusing point. We also probe the robust properties of quantized transport against obstacles and disorders. The study initiates quasienergy-winding-based topological transports, which can feature applications in precise and robust imaging and information processing.         ",

In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology         ",
