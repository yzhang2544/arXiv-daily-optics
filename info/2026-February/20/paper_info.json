    "abstract": "           We introduce MxDiffusion, a hybrid physics- and data-driven diffusion-based framework that enables efficient and highly accurate generation of photonic structures from target optical properties. The improved accuracy is achieved through a two-stage generation strategy, in which the first diffusion model is explicitly trained with Maxwells equation-based loss to embed physical insight directly into the inverse design process, while the second model maps the physically consistent intermediate representation to the final structural geometry with significantly higher fidelity than solely data-driven approaches. The performance of MxDiffusion is validated on two representative applications: gold nanostructures patterned on a silica substrate and a highly tunable bandpass filter based on phase change material. In both cases, the proposed framework consistently outperforms a conventional data-driven diffusion model benchmark, particularly for out-of-training-distribution design targets and highly constrained resonance conditions. These results demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of MxDiffusion as a general physics-guided inverse design paradigm.         ",

    "abstract": "           Hard x-ray emission, associated with hot electron preheat, in direct-drive implosions was observed to be enhanced by a factor of $1.5\\pm0.1$ by application of a $10$ T magnetic field. The applied magnetic field reaches a quasi steady-state aligned with the ablation flow prior to the onset of laser-plasma instabilities in the corona. Hot electrons that would otherwise escape the corona and lead to capsule charging in unmagnetized implosions are confined in a mirror-mode of the magnetic field in magnetized implosions. These hot electrons are shown to subsequently pitch-angle scatter from the mirror onto the capsule, thereby leading to the observed hard x-ray generation in magnetized implosions. Consequently, the energy of charged-fusion products, associated with the capsule charging, are observed to decrease when the implosion is magnetized. These results intensify the need to mitigate laser-plasma instabilities -- particularly for magnetized implosions -- to maximize fusion gain and implosion efficiency.         ",

This Roadmap provides a unified overview of current advances and emerging directions in QCL research.

However, existing characterization frameworks are hindered by several limitations, most notably their inability to account for the polarization of the field. Here, we report polarization sensitive coherent modulation imaging (PS-CMI), a light-weight but robust, high-resolution platform for the full-field characterization of metasurface-modulated light. By supplementing the orthogonal x- and y- complex amplitude components with an additional 45\u00b0-component, this approach calculates the retardance between two orthogonal polarization components while eliminating phase offsets, thereby enabling the subsequent recovery of the complete polarization state. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by characterizing light fields produced by a United States Air Force (USAF) target, two kinds of complex polarization field, and a metalens. This compact solution addresses a critical gap in metasurface metrology and is broadly applicable to other fields requiring the mapping of complex, polarized light distributions.         ",

We find streaming is enhanced when $C_s>1$, suppressed for $0\\leq C_s\\leq1$, and reversed when $C_s<0$. We explain the regimes in terms of the interplay between the Reynolds and viscoelastic stresses that collectively drive fluid motion. Remarkably, we discover the role of viscoelastic shear waves in acoustic streaming transition characterized by the ratio of acoustic attenuation length and shear wavelength. We gain deeper insight into the streaming transition by examining energy dynamics in terms of the loss and storage moduli.

We introduce stochastic tensor contraction to perform such operations with greatly reduced cost, and present its application to the gold-standard quantum chemistry method, coupled cluster theory with up to perturbative triples. For total energy errors more stringent than chemical accuracy, we reduce the computational scaling to that of mean-field theory, while starting to approach the mean-field absolute cost, thereby challenging the existing cost-to-accuracy landscape. Benchmarks against state-of-the-art local correlation approximations further show that we achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in both total computation time and error, with significantly reduced sensitivity to system dimensionality and electron delocalization. We conclude that stochastic tensor contraction is a powerful computational primitive to accelerate a wide range of quantum chemistry.         ",

At thermal equilibrium, we show that violation of Kirchhoff's law yields non-vanishing heat rectification coefficients within different sections of the cavity, which can be tuned for perfect rectification and circulation, while internal monochromatic currents vanish due to the intrinsic coupling between emission and absorption at specular surfaces. This constraint is lifted under nonequilibrium conditions, where rotational heat fluxes within the cavity can be precisely controlled by appropriately combining reciprocal and nonreciprocal materials. These findings open new avenues for thermal management and provide design principles for nonreciprocal photonic devices.         ",

    "abstract": "           Absolute cross sections for the formation of OH- from 2-propanol (CH3CH(OH)CH3) via dissociative electron attachment (DEA) are reported in the incident electron energy range of 3.5-13 eV. Four fragment anions are observed: OH-, C2H2O-, C2H4O-, and C3H7O-. The OH- yield exhibits a pronounced resonance centered at 8.2 eV together with a broader structure extending over the 8-10 eV region. Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster (electron attached) calculations with Singles and Doubles combined with a Complex Absorbing Potential (CAP/EOM-EA-CCSD) assign this feature to a two-particle-one-hole (2p-1h) core-excited Feshbach resonance. Potential energy curves along the C-OH dissociation coordinate reveal that core-excited anion states in this energy range promote efficient cleavage of the hydroxyl group. Analysis of Dyson orbitals and resonance widths demonstrates that only states with repulsive antibonding sigma(C-OH) character and sufficiently long lifetimes contribute significantly to the observed OH- production. These results provide fundamental insight into the DEA dynamics of secondary alcohols and highlight the role of multi-electron-attached resonances in site-specific bond rupture induced by low-energy electrons.

Here, we circumvent this limitation and demonstrate an all-optical mechanism for reconfiguring far-field singularities in a photonic crystal laser. The underlying principle involves optical pumping, which creates a mesoscopic potential landscape whose spatial variations are slow compared to the lattice period. Such a potential localizes a Bloch band into trapped states whose envelope functions, and thus far-field singularity textures, are defined by the pump geometry. Using a honeycomb photonic crystal that supports a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum, we achieve room-temperature telecom-band lasing with real-space polarisation singularities that are reconfigurable in both number and position, while the intrinsic momentum-space singularity at the $\\Gamma$-point is preserved. The experimental observations align quantitatively with an analytical framework that combines the Bloch mode of the structure and envelope function theory, establishing envelope engineering as a versatile route to programmable singular-light emission in active photonic lattices.

We develop a framework, based on microscopic superconductivity theory, to evaluate the power-flow attenuation constant $\\alpha$ of superconducting rectangular waveguides in the $100~\\mathrm{GHz}$--THz range, applicable to arbitrary electronic mean free paths $\\ell$ from the dirty limit $\\ell\\ll\\xi_0$ to the clean limit $\\ell\\gg\\xi_0$. We also derive an analytical expression for two-level-system (TLS)-induced attenuation $\\alpha_{\\rm TLS}$ in thin native oxide layers within the standard TLS model. Using this framework, we perform numerical evaluations of $\\alpha$ for representative materials over standard waveguide sizes from WR15 to WR1. In the high-frequency regime $f \\gtrsim 0.5 \\Delta/h$, low attenuation favors the clean regime $\\ell\\gtrsim\\xi_0$, indicating that high-purity materials can achieve very low attenuation below their gap frequency. For the TLS contribution, using parameter values representative of native Nb oxides, we find that $\\alpha_{\\rm TLS}$ can become relevant at sufficiently low temperatures $T/T_c\\lesssim 0.1$-0.2, where quasiparticle dissipation is exponentially suppressed. Finally, we extend the discussion to the strong-excitation regime using a recently developed nonlinear-response theory within the Keldysh--Usadel framework of nonequilibrium superconductivity and show that nonlinear dissipation produces a Higgs-mode peak in $\\alpha$ near $f\\simeq \\Delta/h$ via a Kerr-type nonlinearity of the dissipative conductivity.

Here, we present a diffusion-based approach to infer effective particle size distributions of DNA-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), consisting of a magnetic core and a polystyrene shell, in a regime where direct geometric sizing is limited by optical diffraction. Using multi-particle tracking microscopy, we analyze the Brownian dynamics of MNPs grafted with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) of varying contour length under low-salt conditions. A physically motivated model is introduced that relates dsDNA contour length to an effective hydrodynamic diameter via an attenuated corona description. The measured diffusion coefficient distributions exhibit a systematic and monotonic dependence on dsDNA length in quantitative agreement with the model. While the tracked objects are predominantly dsDNA-mediated agglomerates rather than isolated nanoparticles, clustering does not obscure the length-dependent signal. Instead, the dsDNA corona determines the hydrodynamic scaling, whereas agglomeration mainly introduces an offset and distribution broadening. These results demonstrate that Brownian dynamics enables robust readout of biomolecular length scales even far below the optical resolution limit. The distribution-based approach is inherently tolerant to polydispersity and aggregation, making diffusion-based tracking a simple and promising strategy for future biotechnological and biomedical assays.

Beyond $\\textit{in situ}$ inference, the method enables $\\textit{in situ}$ training by utilizing established techniques like parameter shift rules or physical backpropagation to extract gradients directly from measurements of the linear optical circuit. We also investigate the effect of photon losses and find the model to be very resilient to these.         ",

    "abstract": "           Preparing quantum states is a fundamental task in various quantum algorithms. In particular, state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators (HOs) is crucial for the creation of qudits and the implementation of high-dimensional algorithms. In this work, we develop a methodology for preparing quantum states in HOs. The HO is coupled to an auxiliary qubit to ensure that any state can be prepared in the oscillator [J. Math. Phys. 59, 072101]. By applying a sequence of square pulses to both the qubit and the HO, we drive the system from an initial state to a target state. To determine the required pulses, we use a neural network that predicts the pulse parameters needed for state preparation. Specifically, we present results for preparing qubit and qutrit states in the HO, achieving average fidelities of 99.9% and 97.0%, respectively.         ",

    "abstract": "           For the simple system of a point-like particle confined to a straight line, I compile, initially in a concise table, the structural elements of quantum mechanics and contrast them with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences, resulting from the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal structure. The latter was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify their quantifications by the variance and entropic indeterminacy inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and others.

    "abstract": "           We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.
