    "abstract": "           The resonant modes of optical cavities provide a powerful resource for laser-frequency stabilization, underpinning high-precision metrology and coherent signal generation. Photonic resonators in which the optical mode propagates through material offer a compact alternative to vacuum Fabry-Perot cavity systems, but their performance is limited by sensitivity of the material to the ambient environment. In this work, we explore second-harmonic (SH) stabilization, which exploits the interplay of a dispersive mode structure against the strict energy conservation of second-harmonic generation. Operationally, we use two, 1550 nm lasers to PDH-detect octave-spaced resonant modes of an ultra-high-Q photonic resonator with one laser frequency-doubled to 775 nm. Under SH stabilization, the microwave frequency offset between the 1550 nm lasers, which we refer to as the SH signal ($f_{SH}$) maps the absolute frequency of the 1550 nm laser to an electronic signal. We characterize this mapping through comparison of the absolute optical frequency inference provided by $f_{SH}$ to an out-of-loop optical measurement, and our results suggest $f_{SH}$ accurately proxies frequency drift. We evaluate the sensitivity and noise floor of this technique, considering contributions from laser locking and bulk material properties, and conclude that $f_{SH}$ is sufficiently sensitive to enhance long-term laser-frequency stability with respect to the resonator. These results demonstrate SH stabilization as a useful technique that infers absolute drift, thereby enabling the increased stability of future compact, precision frequency references.         ",

    "abstract": "           For low-temperature experiments such as liquid xenon dark matter detectors, it is crucial to read out detector signals from cryostats. Traditionally, photoelectrical signals are transmitted from the cryogenic region to the outside using coaxial cables through vacuum feedthroughs on the cryostats. In this paper, we investigate an analog optical transmission method in which the raw electrical signals are converted into optical signals with light intensity linearly proportional to the electrical amplitude, transmitted out of the cryogenic environment through optical fiber, and subsequently converted back into electrical signals by photoelectric devices while preserving the signal waveform. This new approach offers advantages, including low attenuation over long-distance transmission and reduced crosstalk across the feedthroughs. Additionally, the low-temperature optical wavelength multiplexing scheme has been investigated and applied, increasing the transmission capability of a single fiber. At -100 degree Celsius, the proposed analog optical readout system achieves a -3dB bandwidth of larger than 150MHz, a dynamic range of up to 500mV, and a low cryogenic-region power consumption of 70mW per channel, demonstrating its strong potential for low-temperature experiments.

Theprinciple is to measure by interferometry the deflection of a low-intensity probe pulse when crossingthe vacuum optical index gradient produced by an external high-intensity pump pulse. The detectionof the expected signal requires measuring the position of the interference intensity profile with a highspatial resolution, limited by the ultimate quantum noise. However, the spatial resolution is highlydegraded by the phase noise induced by the mechanical vibrations of the interferometer. In order tosuppress this interferometric phase noise, we have developed a new method, named High-FrequencyPhase Noise Suppression (HFPNS) method, based on the use of a delayed reference signal to correctany noise-related signal appearing in the probe beam.

This quantum currency is based on various physical states that can be easily verified but is protected from being copied by the fundamental quantum laws. Four decades later, these ideas have flourished in the field of quantum information, and the concept of quantum banknotes has not only adopted many varying names, such as quantum money, quantum coins, quantum-digital payments, and quantum tokens, but also reached its first experimental demonstrations. In this perspective article, we discuss the current state-of-the-art of quantum tokens in the field of quantum information, as well as their future perspectives. We present a number of physical realizations of quantum tokens with integrated quantum memories and their applicability scenarios in detail.

By systematically eliminating unstable modes while preserving the physically relevant dynamics, our method guaranties long-time convergence without introducing artificial damping or ad hoc modifications. The theoretical framework maintains mathematical rigor through orthogonal projection operators and spectral decomposition. Benchmark calculations on the spin-boson model show excellent agreement with exact hierarchical equations of motion results while achieving significant computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "           Isomerization in molecular systems almost invariably occurs through 3-dimensional motion due to the nature of chemical bonding. Pseudorotation is an unusual type of isomerization that occurs in some high symmetry systems that gives the appearance of rigid-body rotation yet only involves atom rearrangements. This paper demonstrates that pseudorotation occurs in 2-dimensions in an optical matter (OM) system of metal nanoparticle constituents. The difference in dimensionality of the dynamics arises from the electrodynamic field-interference nature of optical binding vs. quantum mechanical bonding in polyatomic molecules. The 8-nanoparticle OM \"kite\" structure we study in experiments and simulations has D2 (D2h) symmetry and a D4 symmetric transition state. The mechanism for pseudorotation involves correlated motion of all 8 nanoparticles with smooth (continuous) evolution of their interactions and without particles jumping in or out of the OM array. While the OM kite structure only occurs with 10% probability vs. other OM isomers, its rate of pseudorotation is rapid relative to transitions to other structural isomers (e.g., \"teardrop\"). The other isomers have structures that lie on a trigonal lattice with inter-particle separations at distances that enhance field interference and induced polarizations. Even though the kite isomer has inter-particle separations that would manifest destructive interference on a particle pair (i.e., 2-body) basis, the kite structure is the slowest to rearrange into any other isomer. We show that the unusual structure and dynamics of the kite optical matter system result from N-body interactions and forces demonstrating that N-body effects are important in this class of active matter and presumably more generally.

    "abstract": "           Recent advances in cold atom interferometry with atom guides have set the stage for miniaturized quantum inertial sensors capable of operating in dynamic environments. In this work, we combine three key innovations - evanescent-field (EF) atom guides, optical nanofiber (NF) testbeds, and membrane-waveguide photonic integrated circuit (PIC) platforms - to advance EF-guided atom interferometry. First, we demonstrate the feasibility of EF atom guides on optical NF testbeds, providing a mean to benchmark membrane-waveguide PIC platforms. Second, we achieve low-power (~5 mW) guiding of freely moving, laser-cooled 133Cs atoms in two-color, traveling-wave EF optical dipole traps at the magic wavelengths of 793 nm and 937 nm - referred to here as 793/937-nm EF atom guides - in contrast to conventional 685/937-nm standing-wave EF optical lattices. The 793/937-nm EF atom guides map directly onto the membrane-waveguide PIC platforms, which can safely handle up to 4-6x times the minimum trap power under vacuum and enable dense cold atom generation for efficient loading into the EF atom guides. Third, we verify preserved atomic coherence via microwave fields and EF-coupled Doppler-free Raman beams. To our knowledge, this is the first report of coherence fringes driven by co-propagating EF-coupled Raman beams with only 150 nW of total optical power. By forging a direct link between optical NF testbeds to membrane-waveguide PIC platforms, our results lay critical groundwork for the on-chip realization of EF-guided atom interferometry and for fully integrated, low-SWaP (size, weight, and power) quantum accelerometers and gyroscopes.

Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms offer a potential route to overcome these limitations; however, their practical deployment on existing quantum computers requires strategies that both reduce problem size and mitigate hardware noise. In this work, we combine Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) to compute ground-state energies of a set of natural ligand-like molecules in the minimal Slater Type Orbital (STO-3G) basis set. DMET provides a systematic fragmentation of a molecule into embedded impurity subproblems, while SQD enables construction and classical diagonalization of reduced configuration spaces through quantum sampling enhanced by iterative configuration recovery. The resulting embedded Hamiltonians are solved on IBM's Eagle R3 superconducting quantum hardware (IBM Sherbrooke). The DMET-SQD energies obtained for all systems considered exhibit strong agreement with DMET-FCI benchmark values within chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). These results demonstrate that sample-based quantum methods, when integrated with a robust embedding framework, can reliably extend quantum computation towards simulation of chemically relevant molecular systems, showcasing potential applications in the field of drug discovery.

In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $\\lambda$, and $\\mu^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $\\alpha^{2}F(\\Omega)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $\\mu^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \\sim 0.4$--$0.6$ nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.
