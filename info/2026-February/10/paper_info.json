    "title": "Visible dual-comb spectroscopy across more than 100 THz with lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguides",
    "abstract": "           Broadband and high-resolution spectroscopy in the visible and ultraviolet is central to advances in multiple fields, including fundamental quantum physics, biology, atmospheric science and astronomy. Traditionally, these measurements are performed with grating or Fourier-transform spectrometers using incoherent light sources. Leveraging coherent light enables powerful frequency-comb-based techniques, but is limited by the technical complexity of efficiently generating broad spectral bandwidths from relatively narrowband and spectrally distant laser sources. Current visible dual-comb spectrometers require implicit compromises between optical bandwidth, experimental simplicity, and acquisition speed. In this work, we introduce a simple and efficient dual-comb spectrometer that converts robust Er:fiber frequency combs from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet and visible with thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) nanophotonic waveguides. Using real-time signal processing, we retrieve coherently averaged dual-comb spectra over nearly 120 THz of simultaneous bandwidth in the visible with 100 MHz spectral resolution. With these capabilities, we measure the broadband absorption spectrum of molecular iodine (I2), demonstrating the broadest visible spectral coverage of a dual-comb spectrometer to date. Additional measurements of NO2, atomic rubidium, and atomic sodium further illustrate the achievable combination of spectroscopic bandwidth, resolution, and intrinsic frequency accuracy. Our results demonstrate the powerful integration of low-power frequency combs, nonlinear nanophotonics, and digital signal processing to enable a compact, efficient and versatile approach to high-resolution mapping of complex absorption spectra across 500 THz in the UV-visible and near-infrared spectral regions for multiple applications beyond the research lab         ",

    "abstract": "           We investigate a microwave cavity-based displacement readout employing a split-post geometry for measuring the motion of a dielectric membrane. The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation. It establishes this platform as a promising candidate for a microwave-mechanical quantum transducer.         ",

However, generating a dense array of evenly spaced ultra-narrow THz comb lines is challenging. Here, we demonstrate broadband THz comb generation using a photoconductive antenna that transfers a noise-suppressed near-infrared electro-optical (EO) comb into the THz domain. Our noise-suppression strategy, leveraging soliton self-frequency shift and spectral filtering, effectively suppresses EO comb phase noise without requiring active stabilization. The resulting THz comb exhibits broad spectral coverage (0.05-4 THz), narrow comb linewidths (0.3 Hz at the Fourier-transform limit), and excellent frequency stability (8.6*10^-14 at 1-second integration). We further demonstrate asynchronous THz time-domain spectroscopy, resolving ~36,000 comb lines with 50 MHz spacing. Crucially, the inherent frequency agility of the EO comb enables rapid and wide-range tuning of the THz comb line spacing. These attributes position our THz comb as a versatile tool for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy and precision THz metrology.         ",

Real-time Stokes parameter extraction enables angle-of-linear-polarization (AoLP) measurements and quantitative retrieval of the birefringence of a 1-mm-thick x-cut quartz crystal, used here as a benchmark anisotropic sample. The extracted birefringence is in good agreement with THz time domain spectroscopy-based measurements, validating the accuracy of the proposed THz polarimetric approach. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) up to 87 dB across 0.23-0.41 THz ensure reliable discrimination of the measured spectral components above the noise floor. Extending this approach to raster-scanned THz imaging using distinct PS-FSS orientations (0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 135\u00b0) enables simultaneous mapping of frequency-dependent Stokes parameters. The resulting degree of linear polarization (DoLP) and AoLP maps exhibit well-resolved polarimetric contrast, consistent with numerical simulations and independent visible polarimetric measurements. Operating entirely without field-resolved detection or mechanical delay stages, the system provides a robust and compact platform for THz polarimetric spectroscopy and imaging of anisotropic materials.

    "abstract": "           Optical frequency combs have revolutionized high-precision spectroscopy, yet an intrinsic trade-off between spectroscopic signal-to-noise ratio (sSNR) and measurement bandwidth ($B$) fundamentally constrains sensitive, broadband measurements. While broadband swept lasers offer a potential solution, generating broadband, ultrafast and linearly sweeping lasers with a narrow linewidth remains a significant challenge, particularly in the fingerprint mid-infrared (mid-IR) band. Here we overcome this limitation by using a microresonator-anchored ultrafast sweeping Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) laser for mid-IR spectroscopy. We introduce a dual-microresonator-anchor approach: a microcomb provides frequency calibration and a high-Q microresonator resolves the instantaneous FDML lasing lineshape. The strategy enables accurate correction of the FDML laser's sweep nonlinearity and broad linewidth in the near-IR, allowing the FDML laser to function as a high-fidelity mid-IR light via difference frequency generation. The system achieves a record sSNR$\\times$$B$ of 1.3$\\times$10$^5$ THz$\\cdot \\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$ and methane sensing precision of 9 ppb$\\cdot$m$\\cdot$$\\sqrt{\\rm s}$, while retaining GHz resolution to distinguish methane isotope. We further demonstrate broadband, coherent swept laser phase spectroscopy in the mid-IR, tolerating losses up to 78 dB. This work leverages advances in integrated photonics to overcome the fundamental limitations of precision spectroscopy, paving the way for next-generation, broadband, and ultra-sensitive mid-IR spectroscopic sensing systems.

Despite these achievements, their resolving power has not yet reached the level required to rival modern wavelength-dispersive grating or crystal spectrometers. Here, we introduce a next-generation SQUID-based microcalorimeter concept that exploits the strong temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth of a superconductor operated close to its critical temperature. The resulting mutual-inductance-based readout enables in situ tunable signal amplification, while inherently avoiding hysteretic effects that commonly limit superconducting sensors. Experiments with prototype devices demonstrate robust and reproducible operation over a wide temperature range. Based on our measurements and modeling, we project that an energy resolution below 100meV should be achievable with an optimized absorber-sensor combination. This approach therefore represents a promising pathway towards next-generation cryogenic detectors for high-precision X-ray spectroscopy.         ",

    "abstract": "           Development of quantum light sources and search for quantum systems capable of supporting collective many-body states are crucial for further progress of modern quantum technologies. Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for quantum light sources, as individual QDs are reliable single photon emitters even at room temperature. However, photon bunching, a key signature of collective many-body states, has been so far largely observed at cryogenic temperatures in perovskite materials, limiting their applications under ambient conditions. Here, we report the observation of collective blinking and photon bunching in perovskite QD superlattices at room temperature. Sub-wavelength-sized (100 - 500 nm) CsPbBr3 QD superlattices, fabricated via a self-assembly process, exhibit an unusual two-level blinking behavior similar to that of single QDs, and demonstrate photon bunching with a degree of up to 2.75. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements and super-resolution imaging reveal that the superlattices have a significantly longer PL lifetime than individual QDs and that their emission is spatially confined to regions tens of nanometers in size. These observations suggest long-range exciton migration to a localized energy trap within the superlattice. Excitation power dependent degree of bunching and analysis of the bunching dynamics indicate that the photon bunching originates from exciton-biexciton cascade emission, a key mechanism for generating entangled photons. These findings establish perovskite QD superlattices as a promising platform for room-temperature collective optical phenomena and quantum light generation, advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies.

The first, a pioneering top-down approach, employs text-prompt-based generative AI to probe quantum aesthetics as a collective cultural construct embedded in large-scale training data. By systematically modulating the linguistic weight of the term \"quantum,\" generative models are used as experimental environments to reveal how quantum imaginaries circulate within contemporary visual culture. The second, a bottom-up approach, derives aesthetic form directly from quantum-mechanical structures through the visualization of quantum-generated data, exemplified here by hydrogen atomic orbitals calculated from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. These approaches are framed not as competing methods but as intersecting paths within a navigable field of artistic research. They position quantum aesthetics as an emergent field of artistic research shaped by cultural imagination, computational mediation, and physical law, opening new directions for artistic practice and pedagogy at the intersection of art, data, artificial intelligence and quantum science.

    "abstract": "           Elemental good metals, including noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) and several $s$-block elements, do not exhibit superconductivity in bulk at ambient pressure, primarily due to weak electron--phonon coupling that fails to overcome Coulomb repulsion. In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $\\lambda$, and $\\mu^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $\\alpha^{2}F(\\Omega)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $\\mu^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \\sim 0.4$--$0.6$~nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.

This work considers the problem interaction and scattering of acoustic waves with a single spatio-temporal interface, and a sequence of two interfaces forming a slab. Several regimes defined by the relation between the sound propagation velocities and the interface velocity (namely subsonic, intersonic, and supersonic regimes) are discussed.

We demonstrate how first-principles Green's function theory combined with the nuclear-electronic orbital method enables us to examine the nature of excitons in a prototypical organic solid of eumelanin, for which the extensive hydrogen bonds have been proposed to facilitate the formation of delocalized excitons.

    "abstract": "           Quantum mechanical interaction potentials typically support either localized bound states below the dissociation threshold or delocalized scattering states above it. While bound states are energetically isolated, scattering states embed a quantum system in a continuum of environmental modes, making dissipation and loss intrisic features of open quantum systems. A striking exception are bound states in the continuum (BICs), which remain localized despite lying within the scattering continuum due to destructive interference. It was predicted that such states can arise from the interference of two Feshbach resonances coupled to a common continuum, yet this mechanism has remained experimentally inaccessible in genuine quantum systems. Here we demonstrate the formation of such an interference-stabilized state in ultracold collisions of ${}^6$Li atoms by coherently coupling two tunable Feshbach resonances using Floquet engineering. At a critical parameter point, both elastic and inelastic coupling to the continuum vanish, yielding a molecular state above the dissociation threshold. Loss spectroscopy, quench dynamics, and rf-photoassociation directly reveal the resulting decoupling from scattering states. Our observations are quantitatively captured by full coupled-channel calculations and a minimal non-Hermitian model, identifying a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC. Our results establish quantum interference as a powerful mechanism for controlling openness in quantum matter and for engineering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.         ",

    "abstract": "           We propose doubly occupied configuration interaction-quantum selected configuration interaction (DOCI-QSCI), which samples from the seniority-zero space. While the use of this space effectively doubles the qubit budget, equaling the number of spatial orbitals, this sector restriction can compromise quantitative accuracy. To compensate for this, we expand sampled bitstrings via their Cartesian product into a larger space that includes seniority-breaking determinants. The resulting wave function is also proposed using the trial state in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) to recover dynamical correlations across the full orbital space (DOCI-QSCI-AFQMC). We evaluate the proposed methods on the H6 chain, N2 dissociation, and the addition of singlet O2 to a BODIPY dye. For the H6 chain, DOCI-QSCI-AFQMC reproduces the accuracy of the level of the complete-active-space counterpart with the quantum device ibm kobe. For N2 and BODIPY-O2, with (14e, 28o) and up to (20e, 20o) active spaces, it yields reasonable results, whereas single-reference CCSD(T) fails qualitatively. These results demonstrate that the DOCI-QSCI doubles the orbital space accessible to conventional QSCI and subsequent ph-AFQMC post-processing delivers reasonably high accuracy.         ",

    "abstract": "           In practical situations, the reliability of quantum resources can be compromised due to complex generation processes or adversarial manipulations during transmission. Consequently, the trials generated sequentially in an experiment may exhibit non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) behavior. This non-i.i.d. behavior can introduce security concerns and result in faulty estimates when performing information tasks such as quantum key distribution, self-testing, verifiable quantum computation, and resource allocation in quantum networks. To certify the performance of such tasks, one can make a random decision in each trial, either spot-checking some desired property or utilizing the quantum resource for the given task. However, a general method for certification with a sequence of non-i.i.d. spot-checking trials is still missing. Here, we develop such a method. This method not only works efficiently with a finite number of trials but also yields asymptotically tight certificates of performance. Our analysis shows that even as the total number of trials approaches infinity, only a constant number of trials needs to be spot-checked on average to certify the average performance of the remaining trials at a specified confidence level.

    "abstract": "           Quantum networks, integrating quantum communication, quantum metrology, and distributed quantum computing, could provide secure and efficient information transfer, high-resolution sensing, and an exponential speed-up in information processing. Deterministic entanglement distribution over long distances is a prerequisite for scalable quantum networks, enabling the utilization of device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) and quantum teleportation to achieve secure and efficient information transfer. However, the exponential photon loss in optical fibres prohibits efficient and deterministic entanglement distribution. Quantum repeaters, incorporating entanglement swapping and entanglement purification with quantum memories, offer the most promising means to overcome this limitation in fibre-based quantum networks. Despite numerous pioneering efforts toward realizing quantum repeaters, a critical bottleneck remains, as remote memory-memory entanglement suffers from decoherence more rapidly than it can be established and purified over long distances. We overcome this by developing long-lived trapped-ion memories, an efficient telecom interface, and a high-visibility single-photon entanglement protocol. This allows us to establish and maintain memory-memory entanglement over a 10 km fibre within the average entanglement establishment time for the same distance. As a direct application, we demonstrate metropolitan-scale DI-QKD, distilling 1,917 secret keys out of 4.05*10^5 Bell pairs over 10 km. We further report a positive key rate over 101 km in the asymptotic limit, extending the achievable distance by more than two orders of magnitude.

Heterogeneous optically detected spin-acoustic resonance (HODSAR) is an optically detected spin-resonance measurement in which the resonant drive is delivered mechanically by a surface acoustic wave (SAW). By leveraging the photo-excited triplet state of pentacene at room temperature, we demonstrate coherent spin manipulation via acoustic driving under zero externally applied magnetic field. The heterogeneously integrated device, referred to as HODSAR, utilizes spin-phonon coupling to achieve mechanically driven, zero-field spin resonance, opening avenues for room-temperature mechanically addressable spin control and device integration. We show that the high-Q multimode response of the SAW resonator enables spectrally selective acoustic addressing of triplet transitions near 105 MHz. Coherent control is evidenced by Rabi oscillations, with a Rabi frequency that increases linearly with the square root of the applied RF input power over the measured drive range, consistent with driven two-level dynamics under acoustic excitation. These results establish spin-acoustic resonance in a heterogeneously integrated molecular thin-film platform and provide a quantitative basis for benchmarking mechanically mediated spin control.

We now demonstrate a complementary scheme in which four magnetometer measurements are used to locate in three dimensions a nearby radio frequency source. The methodology relies on the measurement of a radio frequency vector at two different positions and modeling the source as a magnetic dipole of known orientation. In contrast to coil detection, magnetometers have the advantage of measuring signals in a 2D plane, and do not inductively couple to their environment or each other, making them a strong candidate for localization of hidden RF sources. For this demonstration, we use only a single RF magnetometer to make four measurements of a synchronous and oriented dipole source, but it is to be expected that this could be replaced by four magnetometers working simultaneously. In addition, this work is greatly aided by the introduction of a fully integrated magnetometer, in which all optics, including lasers, are safely enclosed into a compact head with flexible wired connections. The portable, as well as safe, nature of the sensor make it quite valuable for in the field work.         ",

Here we provide a step change by adding measurements for radial polarisation in the condenser back focal plane, probing plasmonic resonances polarised in axial direction. The combined linear and radial polarisation measurements provide a significantly enhanced precision of the retrieved 3D morphology, as we show on defect-free ultra-uniform gold nanospheres of 30 nm nominal diameter characterised by transmission electron microscopy. The measured cross-sections are modelled for an ellipsoidal particle, determining the three semi-axes and rotation angles by fitting the measurements. The material permittivity and surface damping providing the best fit are found. The particle aspect ratio is determined with a precision better than 5%, and the size with an impressive precision of 0.1 nm. Notably, corrections to the Rayleigh-Gans ellipsoid model due to retardation are significant even though the particle diameters are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength in the medium.

These views share a structural commitment: unity requires a single strongly connected component (SCC) in an effective causal graph over a finite integration window $\\tau$. Using the standard black hole causal structure, I show that no SCC can span an event horizon. Any theory that ties unity to strong connectivity must therefore accept that a single conscious field cannot remain numerically identical and unified across such a configuration. From the perspective of the theories themselves, the outcome is bifurcation: each causally connected subsystem continues to satisfy the very structural criteria the theory declared necessary for a unified field. On any such view, the number and boundaries of unified conscious fields are therefore fixed not by the substrate alone but by the conjunction of its internal architecture with the relativistic causal structure of the spacetime it occupies, a dependency that ordinary spacetime conceals by supplying it so abundantly, but which an event horizon abruptly withdraws.

Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.

In this context, this paper presents a tutorial addressing the physical and mathematical foundations of the HHL algorithm, aimed at undergraduate students, explaining its theoretical construction and its implementation for solving linear equation systems. After discussing the underlying mathematical and physical concepts, we present numerical examples that illustrate the evolution of the quantum circuit. Finally, the algorithm's complexity, limitations, and future prospects are analyzed. The examples are compared with their classical simulations, allowing for an operational assessment of the algorithm's performance.         ",

    "title": "Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation",
    "abstract": "           We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\\psi|^2/ \\mathbf 1^2[\\mathcal C]$, where $\\mathbf 1[\\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\\mathcal C$ in configuration space. All physical predictions are local scale invariant, even in the presence of mass terms. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\u00f6dinger and Pauli equations, and for the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, each coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique. Our results provide a pivotal understanding of local scale invariance in quantum theory.         ",

    "title": "Community detection in network using Szegedy quantum walk",
    "abstract": "           In a network, the vertices with similar characteristics construct communities. The vertices in a community are well-connected. Detecting the communities in a network is a challenging and important problem in the theory of complex networks. One approach to solving this problem uses the classical random walks on graphs. In quantum computing, quantum walks are the quantum mechanical counterparts of classical random walks. In this article, we employ a variant of Szegedy's quantum walk to develop a procedure for discovering the communities in networks. The limiting probability distribution of quantum walks assists us in determining the inclusion of a vertex in a community. We apply our community detection procedure to a variety of graphs and social networks, including the relaxed caveman graph, $l$-partition graph, Karate club graph, and the dolphin's social network, among others.
