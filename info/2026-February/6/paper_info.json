    "abstract": "           Atmospheric blocking events drive persistent weather extremes in midlatitudes, but isolating the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) from chaotic internal atmospheric variability on these events remains a challenge. We address this challenge using century-long (1900-2010), large-ensemble simulations with two computationally efficient deep-learning general circulation models. We find these models skillfully reproduce the observed blocking climatology, matching or exceeding the performance of a traditional high-resolution model and representative CMIP6 models. Averaging the large ensembles filters internal atmospheric noise to isolate the SST-forced component of blocking variability, yielding substantially higher correlations with reanalysis than for individual ensemble members. We identify robust teleconnections linking Greenland blocking frequency to North Atlantic SST and El Ni\u00f1o-like patterns. Furthermore, SST-forced trends in blocking frequency show a consistent decline in winter over Greenland, and an increase over Europe. These results demonstrate that SST variability exerts a significant and physically interpretable influence on blocking frequency and establishes large ensembles from deep learning models as a powerful tool for separating forced SST signals from internal noise.

    "abstract": "           Optical frequency combs (OFCs) are frequency rulers essential for precision metrology, next generation navigation, and testing of fundamental physics. Despite intense efforts, chip-integrated OFCs remain laboratory-bound, unable to fulfill their promise of compact and cost-effective deployment. While improvement in fabrication and integration are important, a conceptual limitation has fundamentally stymied progress: on-chip OFC architectures have aimed to miniaturize their table-top counterparts and relied on cascading outward from (i.e., spectrally broadening) a single pump. In integrated platforms, this approach does not readily allow for the generation of strong and low-noise octave-spaced signals that are crucially needed for robust zero-frequency offset detection. Here, we overcome this limitation via an architectural inversion where an optical microcomb forms by filling the spectrum between two octave-separated pump lasers. The two pumps generate a parametrically driven cavity soliton (PDCS) in an integrated $\\chi^{(3)}$ resonator, which robustly self-aligns to (i.e., synchronizes with) the pump lasers across multiple foundry-fabricated devices and operating configurations. This produces a single octave-spanning comb extending from telecom to visible wavelengths, whose zero-frequency offset is completely defined by the two harmonically-related pump lasers, and can therefore be reliably detected and stabilized. We showcase our platform's capabilities by executing all of the three core tasks of OFC metrology: optical frequency synthesis, low-noise millimeter-wave generation, and integrated optical clock readout, using the same self-aligned microcomb with only its input locks changed.

While single-photon emission from QDs has reached a high level of maturity, the realization of high-fidelity entangled photon-pair sources remains an active and rapidly evolving frontier. In this review, we survey the recent progress in QD-based entangled photon sources, highlighting the conceptual evolution from the established biexciton-exciton cascade to the emerging paradigm of spontaneous two-photon emission. We further examine how advances in nanophotonic architectures and coherent control strategies are redefining fundamental performance limits, enabling concurrent improvements in source brightness, coherence, and entanglement fidelity. Finally, we discuss the key physical and technological challenges that must be addressed to bridge the gap between laboratory demonstrations and large-scale deployment. We conclude by outlining the future opportunities for integrating QD-based entangled photon sources into practical quantum communication, computation, and sensing platforms.         ",

Thermal refraction and shock-induced bending are absorbed into the induced curvature, ensuring that such geometric variations are not misidentified as physical vorticity. For canonical entropy-spot refraction and normal-shock discontinuities, Euclidean Helmholtz--Hodge and momentum-potential post-processing produce significant leakage in the refracting/discontinuous region, whereas the covariant splitting remains at the numerical noise floor (typically $\\lesssim 10^{-12}$) throughout the domain, demonstrating robustness even at the sonic horizon, where the Euclidean metric singularity typically causes catastrophic error amplification. This geometric framework for velocity fields resolves the ambiguity of irrotational motion in inhomogeneous media and establishes a necessary foundation for future generalizations to full thermodynamic state vectors.

This allows us to construct a complete spatiotemporal topological phase diagram in a unified parameter space. By mapping this phase diagram onto a spatially graded PC, we experimentally observe multiple Bloch momentum-band gaps and a continuous spatiotemporal topological transition via translating across the static sample, enabling real-time control over the evolution pathway of the band topology.

    "abstract": "           Nonlinear SU(1,1) quantum interferometers based on non-degenerate optical parametric down-conversion exhibit strong unbalanced group velocity dispersion (GVD). This feature is intrinsic to this type of interferometer as correlated photons of vastly different frequencies propagate through a dispersive nonlinear crystal; consequently, the dispersion arises from the source itself. The resulting GVD degrades the axial point-spread function (PSF) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) with undetected photons; and physical compensation is less straightforward, in particular for non-degenerate broadband regimes due to the limited number of suitable materials. In this contribution, we analyze dispersion in bulk nonlinear interferometry and describe its implications for OCT imaging. Aspects of hardware compensation are addressed, and a novel empirical numerical method of compensation is proposed. The approach is based on the extraction of the phase component directly from the time-domain modality (high precision linearized quantum Fourier transform infrared spectrometer) and its injection into the mid-IR spectral-domain OCT signals (central wavelength of around 3770 nm) before the Fourier transform. The proposed method is compared with an alternative numerical technique. The results demonstrate a 2.2-fold improvement in axial resolution and outperform the alternative correction method in overall imaging performance.         ",

Here we demonstrate a mechanically reconfigurable slow-light delay line based on a surface nanoscale axial photonics (SNAP) microresonator dynamically induced by controlled bending of a silica optical fiber. A localized nanoscale cutoff-wavelength dip, introduced by CO2-laser annealing, provides a reflective boundary, while fiber bending generates a smooth axial potential whose shape is continuously tunable via loop curvature. By adjusting the bending radius, the induced SNAP microresonator evolves from a nearly linear to an approximately semiparabolic axial profile, enabling a controlled transition from dispersive to nearly dispersionless delay. Using a transverse microfiber coupler operated at the impedance-matching condition, we experimentally demonstrate continuous delay tuning from 2 ns to 0.5 ns within a 10 GHz bandwidth in an approximately 2 mm long fiber segment, with insertion loss below 6 dB. The results confirm that mechanically induced SNAP microresonators provide a compact, robust, and reconfigurable platform for dispersion-engineered optical delay lines, with direct relevance to photonic beamforming, frequency-comb stabilization, and neuromorphic photonic signal processing.

Its nonlinearities and internal feedback enable analogue, spiking, and bistable responses that are accessed by tuning the injection power and wavelength.

In the digital scheme, spiking dynamics naturally generate sparse reservoir states, enabling efficient classification even with a single spike. Intriguingly, optimal operating points are at the boundaries where sharp transitions in dynamical complexity and/or output power occur. In these points, the SCISSOR supports high task-performance, opening novel strategies for future on-chip training.

However, the high power requirement remains a major obstacle to the widespread use of OPAs. Integrated OPAs can in principle improve the pump efficiency with tight mode confinement; however, challenges associated with propagation loss, limited nonlinearity, and susceptibility to nanoscale fabrication imperfections prevent them from competing with conventional bulk and fiber-based OPAs. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient integrated OPAs with continuous-wave net gain. The pump efficiency is improved by over one order of magnitude. Phase-sensitive gain of 23.5 dB is demonstrated, significantly exceeding previous integrated OPAs, using only 110 mW pump power and no cavity enhancement. This is achieved with parametric down-conversion in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides using the adapted poling technique to maintain the coherence of nonlinear interactions. Moreover, the high parametric gain exceeds fibre-chip-fibre losses, leading to appreciable net gain up to 10 dB. The 3 dB bandwidth is approximately 120 nm, covering telecommunication S-, C-, and Lbands. Quantum-limited noise performance is confirmed through the measurement of output field fluctuation below the classical limit. We further demonstrate that signalto-noise ratio in noisy optical communications can be increased by leveraging this efficient integrated OPA.

During signal accumulation, our time-interleaved approach sequentially applies the in-phase and quadrature driving fields, thereby eliminating the effects of nonlinear interaction on signal accumulation. Our AIQM scheme achieves better metrological performance than conventional schemes, particularly under strong nonlinear interaction and prolonged signal accumulation, with pronounced robustness against parameter variations.

Generation and control of HPPs are typically accessed using classical near-field probes, which limits experiments at the quantum level.A complementary frontier in hBN research focuses on color centers: bright, stable, atomically localized emitters that have rapidly emerged as a promising platform for solid-state quantum optics. Here we establish a key connection between these two directions by developing a cavity-QED framework in which a single hBN color center serves as a quantum source of HPPs. We quantify the emitter-HPP interaction and analyze two generation schemes. The first is spontaneous emission into the phonon sideband, which can produce single-HPP events and, in ultrathin slabs, becomes single-mode with an enhanced decay rate. The second is a stimulated Raman process that provides frequency selectivity, tunable conversion rate, and narrowband excitation. This drive launches spatially confined, ray-like HPPs that propagate over micrometer distances. We also outline a two-emitter correlation measurement that can directly test the single-polariton character of these emissions. By connecting color-center quantum optics with hyperbolic polaritonics, our approach enables quantum emitters to act as on-chip quantum sources and controls for HPPs, while HPPs provide long-range channels that couple spatially separated emitters. Together, these capabilities point to a new direction for mid-infrared photonic experiments that unite strong coupling, spectral selectivity, and spatial reach within a single material system.

    "abstract": "           We experimentally investigate the quantum noise mechanisms that limit continuously operating multiparameter quantum sensors. Using a hybrid rf-dc optically pumped magnetometer, we map the photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise over an order of magnitude in probe power and a factor of three in pump power while remaining quantum-noise-limited. We observe linear, quadratic, and cubic scaling of the respective total noise powers with probe photon flux, together with a quadratic dependence of back-action on pump photon flux, in quantitative agreement with a stochastic Bloch-equation model. At higher probe powers, additional probe-induced relaxation modifies the spin-noise spectrum while preserving the integrated noise scaling. Our results reveal fundamental, resource-dependent trade-offs unique to continuously monitored multiparameter sensors and establish experimentally the quantum limits governing their optimal operation.

    "abstract": "           Photonic quantum computing is a strong contender in the race to fault-tolerance. Recent proposals using qubits encoded in frequency modes promise a large reduction in hardware footprint, and have garnered much attention. In this encoding, linear optics, i.e., beam splitters and phase shifters, is necessarily not energy-conserving, and is costly to implement. In this work, we present designs of frequency-mode beam splitters based on modulated arrays of coupled resonators. We develop a methodology to construct their effective transfer matrices based on the SLH formalism for quantum input-output networks. Our methodology is flexible and highly composable, allowing us to define $N$-mode beam splitters either natively based on arrays of $N$-resonators of arbitrary connectivity or as networks of interconnected $l$-mode beam splitters, with $l<N$. We apply our methodology to analyze a two-resonator device, a frequency-domain phase shifter and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer obtained from composing these devices, a four-resonator device, and present a formal no-go theorem on the possibility of natively generating certain $N$-mode frequency-domain beam splitters with arrays of $N$-resonators.

    "abstract": "           A hybrid dual-readout calorimeter concept, comprising both electromagnetic and hadronic sections, has recently been proposed to meet the performance requirements of experiments at future e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ colliders. The front compartment consists of a homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter made of high-density crystals, each coupled to a pair of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) providing the simultaneous readout of scintillation and Cherenkov light. To efficiently detect Cherenkov photons in the presence of dominant scintillation signals, an optical filter is placed in front of one of the two SiPMs to suppress photons in the wavelength region corresponding to that of scintillation emission. % In this study, PWO, BGO, and BSO crystals with different dimensions were tested to measure their scintillation light yield and decay time, as well as their transmission and emission spectra. A set of $\\sim 100~\\rm \\mu m$-thick optical filters was also characterized by measuring their transmittance curves. The experimental results were used to model and estimate the expected filter performance in attenuating scintillation light for the various crystals. % The performance of each filter was experimentally validated by measuring the crystal light output with and without the filter using a $^{22}$Na radioactive source and a LYSO:Ce crystal, confirming the accuracy of the calculations. % The results show that interference filters are unsuitable for this application because their transmittance strongly depends on the photon incidence angle. Conversely, two absorptive long-pass filters with cutoff wavelengths around 590~nm were found to block more than 99\\% of the scintillation light from PWO crystals, satisfying the calorimeter specifications.

    "abstract": "           Inverse Compton scattering (ICS) is a promising method for generating coherent and tunable x-rays in a compact setup. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework describing the output of an ICS x-ray source for arbitrary interaction angles between pulsed electron and laser beams. This allows for analytic optimization of the x-ray beam properties by varying the parameters defining the geometry. In general, different x-ray applications require optimization of different x-ray beam properties, such as energy spread for x-ray spectroscopy and angular spread for x-ray scattering measurements. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to optimization of the x-ray brilliance, which is a comprehensive figure of merit for x-ray beam quality. We investigate two specific ICS interaction geometries in particular: head-on scattering of a laser beam off an electron beam; and scattering of a laser beam off an electron beam in a co-propagating geometry, interacting under a grazing angle. For head-on scattering we show that a tightly focused, cylindrically symmetric laser pulse, which balances laser intensity and interaction time, optimizes the x-ray brilliance. For a co-propagating, grazing angle geometry, an elliptical focus of the laser pulse is required to mitigate the effect of a reduced interaction time. We find that the latter geometry is especially useful for soft x-ray generation.         ",

The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum non-orthogonal multi-reference methods designed for near-term hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements between reference states. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of ansatz that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: linear combinations of orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and linear combinations of states prepared by generalized UCCSD circuits of polynomial depth, for which computing the expectation values of local fermionic observables up to a constant additive error is $\\mathsf{BQP}$-complete. We discuss the implications for achieving practical quantum advantage in resolving the electronic structure of catalytic systems composed from multivalent transition metal atoms using near-term quantum hardware.

The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder.

While researchers have studied how easy VQAs are to train, the effect of quantum noise on the classical optimisation process is still not well understood. Contrary to expectations, we find that twirling, which is commonly used in standard error-mitigation strategies to symmetrise noise, actually degrades performance in the variational setting, whereas preserving biased or non-unital noise can help classical optimisers find better solutions. Analytically, we study a universal quantum regression model and demonstrate that relatively uniform Pauli channels suppress gradient magnitudes and reduce expressivity, making optimisation more difficult. Conversely, asymmetric noise such as amplitude damping or biased Pauli channels introduces directional bias that can be exploited during optimisation. Numerical experiments on a variational eigensolver for the transverse-field Ising model confirm that non-unital noise yields lower-energy states compared to twirled noise. Finally, we show that coherent errors are fully mitigated by re-parameterisation. These findings challenge conventional noise-mitigation strategies and suggest that preserving noise biases may enhance VQA performance.         ",
