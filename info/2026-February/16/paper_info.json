    "abstract": "           This study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel fabrication technique for high spatial resolution CsI: Tl scintillation detectors tailored for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) systems. Building upon our previously developed laser induced optical barrier (LIOB) method, which achieved high spatial resolution, excellent sensitivity, and 100% fabrication yield in CsI: Tl detectors, we extend this approach to a converging-pixel architecture. A CsI: Tl crystal array with converging pixels was designed and fabricated, featuring entrance-face pixels of 1.6x1.6 mm2 and photodetector side pixels of 2x2 mm2. To localize gamma-ray interactions, both the center of gravity (CoG) algorithm and a maximum-likelihood (ML) based decoding method were implemented. A custom built four axis motion platform was developed to deliver a finely collimated pencil beam at precisely controlled positions and angles across the array, enabling generation of a comprehensive dataset for prior knowledge and validation. The results demonstrate an energy resolution of 11.79+/-0.53% (collimated experiment) and a position localization accuracy of 1.00+/-0.42 mm (nearest neighbor interpolation), confirming that the proposed converging-pixel architecture, combined with statistical decoding algorithms, provides a promising path toward the development of high-performance SPECT detectors.

    "abstract": "           We incorporate a solver for the fragment problem with accuracy beyond coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) into the previously proposed static embedding framework, MPCC. To this end, we employ a CCSDT solver for the fragment subsystem. For the environment subsystem, we construct a perturbative estimate of the triples amplitudes, explicitly accounting for feedback from all fragment amplitudes. The resulting approach is denoted MPCCSDT(pt). We further introduce a more complete formulation in which feedback from the environment amplitudes to the fragment amplitudes is also included. This scheme involves an iterative treatment of the environment triples amplitudes and is denoted MPCCSDT(it). In addition, we assess the accuracy of the previously proposed low-level method by introducing a modified low-level approach that incorporates a lowest-order treatment of selected long-range effects, including spin fluctuations and charge polarization. All resulting approaches may be viewed as post-CCSD(T) methods. We therefore consider test cases for which CCSD(T) exhibits substantial deviations from CCSDT. Our results demonstrate that inclusion of triples amplitudes at the fragment level alone is insufficient; a perturbative treatment of the environment triples amplitudes is required. For many energy-difference applications, feedback from the environment triples amplitudes to the fragment amplitudes, is not essential, but it does play a role in the very challenging molecules. A very interesting finding from our study is that in some challenging cases, we need an improved (second-order) perturbative method for the SD amplitudes, going beyond the first-order one used in our earlier work.

A normalized fluid Poisson model is formulated using polylogarithm based expressions for the partially degenerate electrons positrons, while cold negatively charged dust grains provide the inertial response. Linear dispersion analysis yields a modified DA phase speed. Nonlinear solitary structures are investigated using the Sagdeev pseudopotential method. The system is found to support only negative potential (rarefactive) DA solitary waves within a bounded subsonic Mach number interval. The critical Mach number, consequently, the corresponding linear DA speed show an explicit dependence on the degeneracy parameters and the ion spectral index. The amplitude and width of the solitary structures are shown to be highly sensitive to the electron (positron) degeneracy strength, the ion positron concentration ratios, the ion temperature ratio, and the superthermality of the ions. A small amplitude approximation of the pseudopotential reduces the system to the Korteweg de Vries limit, providing closed form expressions for the soliton characteristics, in agreement with the Sagdeev predictions. The results clarify the combined roles of finite temperature degeneracy and superthermal ions in shaping nonlinear DA dynamics in space and astrophysical dusty plasmas.         ",

We reveal that curvature-induced geometric effects can substantially modify the SP dispersion and enable resonant matching by laser beat waves. This is inaccessible in planar geometries or with a single laser. Under matched resonance conditions, a high-amplitude SP-based wakefield can be generated by a few gigawatt lasers, placing this mechanism within reach of state-of-the-art fibre lasers. It therefore opens a route toward portable laser-driven plasma wakefield accelerators.         ",

    "abstract": "           Neural quantum states (NQS) provide a flexible and highly expressive parameterization of wave functions for strongly correlated problems in quantum chemistry. Despite rapid advances in network architectures, the evaluation of electronic energies remains almost exclusively based on variational Monte Carlo (VMC). While VMC is effective for structured systems such as spin chains, its accuracy and efficiency for electronic Hamiltonians are hindered by sharply peaked distributions, stochastic gradient noise, and slow convergence with sample size. In this letter, we assess the capability of NQS-VMC to efficiently capture correlation in electronic ground states by comparing it to a recently developed NQS-based selected configuration (NQS-SC) approach. We set up a systematic comparison of the ground-state optimizations obtained with NQS-VMC and NQS-SC for molecular systems dominated by either static or dynamical correlation. The comparison demonstrates a clear advantage of NQS-SC over NQS-VMC in both energy accuracy and wave-function coefficients, particularly for statically correlated molecules. Moreover, NQS-SC exhibits robust systematic improvability, whereas NQS-VMC does not. These findings position NQS-SC as the new default approach over NQS-VMC for electronic structure calculations. We further observe that neither NQS-SC nor NQS-VMC can efficiently capture dynamical correlation, highlighting the need for future hybrid methods, such as multiconfigurational perturbation theories built on top of NQS solutions.

    "abstract": "           Femtosecond laser modification of fused silica enables precise surface tailoring for the fabrication of micro-optical components such as microlenses and diffractive elements. However, the process is governed by laser-matter interactions where the local fluence determines the processing depth, often limiting control over feature geometry and efficiency. Here, we present a hybrid approach combining localized Au implantation (1.8 MeV Au2+ ions) into SiO2 samples with femtosecond laser irradiation (250 fs), effectively tuning the laser-matter interaction and resulting morphology. At both 515 nm and 1030 nm irradiation wavelengths, single-shot femtosecond pulses produce cylindrical craters with sharp edges and flat-bottom profiles. Independently of the fluence, these craters exhibit a constant depth of 550 nm, corresponding to the region of maximum Au concentration. The effect manifests already at moderate fluence (app. 4 J/sq.cm) and yields high ablation efficiency, up to 15 cubic micrometers per microjoule. The hybrid method also works effectively at lower implantation doses that preserve the excellent transmission of fused silica, offering a promising pathway for the high-quality fabrication of flat optical components such as binary phase masks, phase lenses, or fused-silica micromolds.

    "abstract": "           In SEP events, velocity dispersion (VD) is characterized by the earlier arrival of faster, higher-energy particles relative to slower ones, assuming negligible acceleration time and transport effects. The \"Labor Day event\" at Parker Solar Probe (PSP) on 2022 September 5 provided a unique arrival profile, in which the medium energy (~ few MeV) particles arrive earlier than both lower and higher energy particles. This created a so-called \"nose\" structure in the intensity spectrogram formed by measurements from the two energetic particle instruments, EPI-Lo and EPI-Hi, of the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) suite. Unlike typical VD, the delayed arrival of higher energy particles compared to medium energy particles, i.e., the \"inverse velocity arrival\" (IVA), could be caused by various acceleration, transport, and instrumental effects, including shock acceleration. By applying a new method based on the contour-line of the intensity, we found 14 IVA events in the ISOIS observations up to the end of 2024. Several parameters that may modify velocity dispersion characteristics are further explored including the spacecraft radial distance, the speed of corresponding CMEs and shocks, the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field, and the spacecraft magnetic footpoint longitudinal separation from the flare location. The energy of the early arriving particles, i.e., the nose energy, can be grouped into low (L, <0.5 MeV), medium(M, 0.5 - 5 MeV), and high(H, >5 MeV) categories. Most (11/14) of the IVA events have medium nose energies. This SEP list provides ingredients for examination of shock acceleration in the inner heliosphere, and the existence of IVA events sheds new light on the acceleration and propagation of SEPs.

However, their utilization is currently limited because of slow and imperfect state detection and weak dipolar interaction, limiting fast and large-scale entanglement generation. We propose and analyze a scheme for quantum logic control and measurement-based state preparation in a hybrid platform of polar molecules and neutral atoms. The method leverages fast, high-fidelity atom-molecule gates and high-fidelity atomic ancilla measurements to overcome the common challenges in molecule-only platforms, while preserving their diverse structural advantages. The proposed atom-molecule controlled-phase gate is based on resonant dipole-dipole exchange between a molecular rotational transition and an atomic Rydberg transition, rendering it three orders of magnitude faster than any direct molecule-molecule entangling gate. We further study several applications of our scheme including the preparation of molecular GHZ states for quantum enhanced precision measurements, the preparation of exotic molecular qudit states with topological order, and measurement-altered criticality. Our scheme is applicable to any polar molecule. It expands the paradigm of quantum logic control and paves the way to large-scale molecular entangled states. More generally, it highlights a concrete hybrid quantum system in which each qubit is utilized in an optimal way and where the measurement-based approach can yield a significant advantage in near-term devices.

YBCO thin films imaged at 3 K exhibit a more disordered vortex arrangement reflecting stronger pinning, while maintaining quantitative agreement between measured vortex density and the applied magnetic field.

In this investigation, we compared two versions of the QuILT that were developed and validated to help students learn various aspects of quantum optics using a Mach Zehnder Interferometer with single photons and polarizers. One version of the QuILT is entirely conceptual while the other version integrates quantitative and conceptual reasoning (hybrid version). Performance on conceptual questions of upper-level undergraduate and graduate students who engaged with the hybrid QuILT was compared with that of those who utilized the conceptual QuILT emphasizing the same concepts. Both versions of the QuILT focus on the same concepts, use a scaffolded approach to learning, and take advantage of research on students' difficulties in learning. The hybrid and conceptual QuILTs were used in courses for upper-level undergraduates or first-year physics graduate students in several consecutive years at the same university. The same conceptual pre-test and post-test were administered after traditional lecture-based instruction in relevant concepts and after student engaged with the QuILT, respectively. We find that the post-test performance of physics graduate students who utilized the hybrid QuILT on conceptual questions, was better than those who utilized the conceptual QuILT. For undergraduates, the results showed differences for different classes. One possible interpretation of these findings consistent with our framework is that integrating conceptual and quantitative aspects of physics in research-based tools and pedagogies should be commensurate with students' prior knowledge of physics and mathematics involved.

    "abstract": "           Compact, lightweight, and energy-efficient cold atom systems are crucial for advancing quantum technologies, yet their realization remains constrained by the bulky optical and magnetic components required in current atom trapping architectures. Here, we demonstrate a low-SWaP magneto-optical trap that seamlessly integrates planar optical and magnetic components into a unified platform. A monolithic dual-functional metasurface simultaneously polarized and shapes the cooling beam, replacing traditional lens-waveplate assemblies and converting a linearly polarized Gaussian beam into a circularly polarized flat-top beam. In parallel, a planar coil chip substitutes bulky anti-Helmholtz cols and generated the required quadrupole magnetic field with drastically reduced power consumption. Under D2 line cooling of 87Rb atoms, the fully planar system delivers nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement in trapping performance while operating at a fraction of the size, weight, and power of traditional systems. This compact, bulky-component-free approach offers a scalable, energy-efficient pathway toward chip-scale cold atom platforms.         ",

    "abstract": "           Controlling how an open photonic system exchanges energy with its environment-and in particular how it radiates into the far field-is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian wave physics and a key enabler for directional photonic functionalities. Here, we propose a new route to robust unidirectional emission based on the non-Hermitian hybridization of resonances localized in spatially separated layers of a hetero-bilayer photonic crystal. By tailoring the interlayer coupling, we engineer hybrid photonc bands that exhibit strong unidirectional radiation across a broad spectral and momentum range while maintaining theoretically high quality factors. This asymmetric emission is organized by a topological vortex in a pseudo-polarization field defined from the front/back intensity imbalance, which endows the directionality with robustness against perturbations. We further show that, by tuning the surrounding refractive index, this singularity can be displaced in parameter space, enabling reversible switching of the emission direction and a reconfigurable far-field response. This framework opens perspectives for topological photonic sensing and for directional and switchable light sources, including unidirectional lasing supported by high-quality-factor modes.         ",

    "abstract": "           Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is a key transparent conductive oxide for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, yet its high reflectance limits light-trapping efficiency. This work demonstrates a simple DC plasma sputtering approach to deposit carbonaceous Al2O3 microdots on FTO under controlled Ar, O2, and Ar-O2 atmospheres. For plasma discharge in the normal mode, with plasma density 10^9 cm^-3 and temperature of 2 eV, Volmer-Weber growth produced discrete microdots whose size and distribution were tuned by gas composition: dense, uniform dots in Ar (approximately 0.89 um radius), agglomerated structures in O2, and intermediate morphologies in mixed atmospheres. Structural analysis confirmed Al2O3 formation with carbon incorporation, while SEM revealed morphology-driven optical behavior. UV-Vis measurements showed that Ar-O2 coatings achieved the lowest reflectance across the visible range, outperforming bare FTO and other conditions. These findings establish a clear link between sputtering parameters, surface morphology, and optical performance, offering a scalable route to anti-reflective, light-trapping coatings for next-generation solar cells and optoelectronic devices.

    "abstract": "           Exact diagonalization (ED) is a cornerstone technique in quantum many-body physics, enabling precise solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for interacting quantum systems. Despite its utility in studying ground states, excited states, and dynamical behaviors, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size presents significant computational challenges. We introduce XDiag, an open-source software package designed to combine advanced and efficient algorithms for ED with and without symmetry-adapted bases with user-friendly interfaces. Implemented in C++ for computational efficiency and wrapped in Julia for ease of use, XDiag provides a comprehensive toolkit for ED calculations. Key features of XDiag include the first publicly accessible implementation of sublattice coding algorithms for large-scale spin system diagonalizations, efficient Lin table algorithms for symmetry lookups, and random-hashing techniques for distributed memory parallelization. The library supports various Hilbert space types (e.g., spin-1/2, electron, and t-J models), facilitates symmetry-adapted block calculations, and automates symmetry considerations. The package is complemented by extensive documentation, a user guide, reproducible benchmarks demonstrating near-linear scaling on thousands of CPU cores, and over 20 examples covering ground-state calculations, spectral functions, time evolution, and thermal states. By integrating high-performance computing with accessible scripting capabilities, XDiag allows researchers to perform state-of-the-art ED simulations and explore quantum many-body phenomena with unprecedented flexibility and efficiency.

    "abstract": "           Due to the advent of Quantum Mechanics' 100th anniversary in 2025, we wrote this review paper in order to present a discussion that addresses the foundations of this theory. And since the creation of this Mechanics and other quantum theories was guided, for instance, by correspondence principles that needed to be identified between them and other well-established physical theories, this paper will be devoted to discussing the correspondence between these quantum theories and Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. More precisely, what we will do throughout this paper is discuss how the Maxwell's electromagnetic theory in free space and the stronger formulation of the correspondence principle already pointed, together, to the basis of a Quantum Mechanics that was only be formulated half a century later. And, in order to make this very clear, we will show that the quantum-mechanical description of a photon can already be identified, simply, by manipulating Maxwell's equations in free space with mathematical resources that, for instance, were already well known before the advent of Quantum Mechanics.

    "abstract": "           In this paper, we present a robust entanglement-assisted synchronization framework for indoor optical wireless systems that explicitly captures the coupling between spatial beam geometry and temporal synchronization accuracy. Unlike conventional approaches that treat beam steering and timing estimation independently, a unified spatio temporal model is developed that links user position uncertainty to the Cramer Rao lower bound of the synchronization error. The framework incorporates key physical impairments, including multipath dispersion, non Gaussian detector jitter, and spatially correlated localization errors. Through analytical modeling and extensive simulations, we show that the proposed system exhibits graceful performance degradation under heavy tailed positioning uncertainty and remains stable in the presence of multipath induced bias. Using realistic single photon detector parameters, the results indicate that synchronization accuracy below $10$ picoseconds can be maintained across a wide range of operating conditions. This level of precision provides a scalable foundation for quantum enabled indoor wireless networks.         ",
