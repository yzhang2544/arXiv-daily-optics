    "abstract": "           Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is effective in treating neurological disorders but involves invasive surgery. Non-invasive DBS aims to overcome surgical risks by means of externally applied electromagnetic fields. In this work, we present a method for non-invasive microwave focusing of amplitude-modulated electric fields in the human brain using an external antenna array. The method combines iterative time-reversal (iTR) and genetic-algorithm-based temporal interference (TI) optimization to determine antenna positions, orientations, operating frequency, amplitudes, and phases of each element. Magnetic point dipoles are used as idealized radiative sources, providing a design-independent benchmark for optimization studies. Furthermore, this work incorporates realistic tissue properties from voxelized anatomical head models, accounting for variations in permittivity and conductivity. The iTR algorithm provides an initial antenna configuration that serves as a reliable starting point for the subsequent TI optimization, improving convergence and focusing precision. The results demonstrate that amplitude-modulated electromagnetic fields can be selectively and precisely shaped within predefined focal regions. Thereby, this study demonstrates a proof-of-principle of non-invasive microwave field focusing using iTR and TI in a realistic human head model.         ",

    "title": "The Free-Electron Laser Model of Magnetospheric Chorus",
    "abstract": "           Chorus waves are electromagnetic waves named for their resemblance to birds chirping at dawn when their radio frequencies are played as audio. The amplification of chorus in Earth's magnetosphere has been the subject of intense scientific inquiry since the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts in 1958. Resonant interactions between chorus and radiation belt electrons can lead to the exponential growth of small seed waves by a factor of fifty within milliseconds. These powerful modes can cause rapid acceleration of electrons and endanger space-based technologies. Recent efforts to understand chorus amplification have drawn upon parallels to free-electron lasers, laboratory devices that generate intense coherent light with tunable frequencies. This approach, known as the free-electron laser model of magnetospheric chorus, is the subject of this dissertation. In this work, we build on previous research on the free-electron laser model, ultimately presenting a novel nonlinear model of whistler-mode chorus in the magnetosphere. In the first chapter, we provide a brief introduction to whistlers, magnetospheric chorus, and free-electron lasers. We also derive the 2N+2 equations foundational to the interaction of chorus with N resonant electrons. In the second chapter, we derive a reduced set of just three nonlinear equations using the method of collective variables. We then derive a Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE) for the behavior of a chorus wave packet with a spectrum of frequencies with spatially varying amplitudes and discuss the prediction of solitary chorus waves. In the third chapter, we focus on the behavior of the single-mode solutions predicted by the GLE, including their linear stability and the phenomenon of mode condensation, where a single mode can emerge from a noisy spectrum. In the final chapter, we summarize the results and discuss open questions and future directions.         ",

The setup supports single- and multi-ring necklace vortex patterns, including monopoles, dipoles, tripoles, quadrupoles, pentapoles, sextupoles, octupoles, and 12-poles. In contrast with the inherent instability of conventional vortex beams with high topological charges (winding numbers), vortex necklace-shaped solitons with large winding numbers are found to be stable in the present setup. In particular, octupoles exhibit stable breathing dynamics, and 12-pole necklaces with high winding numbers may be stable. These findings provide a new way for generating stable vortex necklaces, offering a vast potential for manipulations of complex spatiotemporal light fields.         ",

Consequently, contactless manipulation and interaction with centimeter-scale tangible elements in open settings remain difficult to achieve. Here, we present PolygonWave, a solid--fluid acoustic interface that enables transport and tangible interaction by coupling airborne ultrasound with liquid-mediated support. The system employs lightweight Janus icons with asymmetric wettability: a superhydrophobic upper surface permits dry touch interaction, while a hydrophilic lower surface couples to a water droplet resting on a superhydrophobic mesh. Focused acoustic fields generated by a 256-element phased array induce lateral forces, enabling programmable motion without mechanical contact. Systematic characterization demonstrates transport of payloads up to 525 mg across variations in icon size, droplet volume, and applied load. Beyond translation, the liquid layer functions as a reconfigurable mechanical element, enabling button-like input with self-recovery and resonance-driven vibro-visual feedback, exhibiting a peak response near 22 Hz for 200 \\textmu L droplets. Liquid-mediated acoustic coupling provides a unified mechanism for mechanically expressive, touch-accessible tangible interfaces bridging acoustics, soft matter physics, and physical human--computer interaction.

While optical computing offers intrinsic advantages in bandwidth and power consumption, existing implementations remain bulky, wavelength-specific, and dependent on complex training procedures, limiting scalability and parallel operation. In this work, we demonstrate a compact, training-free optical processor based on wavy diffractive features, known as Fourier surfaces, for parallel image classification. Our device achieves classification accuracies of up to 84% for digit datasets and 66% for fashion datasets within a 40$\\times$40 $\\mu$m$^2$ footprint. The diffractive layer inherently separates incident wavelengths into distinct output directions, enabling broadband operation and allowing multiple colors to function as independent computation channels. As a result, this passive system supports up to 20 simultaneous computations within a single optical pass. These results highlight the potential of nanoscale diffractive systems to achieve high compute densities, paving the way for scalable, low-power optical processors for machine learning and image-recognition applications.

However, nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) remain largely neglected due to their significant computational cost, limiting MD's ability to capture isotope effects and quantum tunnelling and leading to systematic thermodynamic errors. We extend path-integral coarse-graining (PIGS), a machine-learning approach for qualitatively incorporating NQEs, into a rigorous and accurate method for quantum thermodynamics. Specifically, this extended framework (EPIGS) enables the construction of temperature-transferable effective potentials that rigorously incorporate NQEs into classical MD simulations. Central to EPIGS is an instanton-based free-energy perturbation scheme (RPI-FEP) that provides direct and efficient estimation of the path-integral centroid potential. Benchmarks against full path-integral simulations on representative hydrogen-bonded systems, including liquid water, show that EPIGS reproduces free energies and enthalpies within 0.2 meV/atom at near-classical cost. EPIGS transforms the qualitative PIGS approach into an accurate and scalable route to quantum thermodynamic simulations in complex systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Light-harvesting and excitation energy transfer in photosynthesis generally involve chlorophyll-molecules, maintained by their host proteins at short distances from each other, this resulting in excitonic coupling. The transfer of excitation energy to the reaction centers consists of exciton migration and relaxation within and between photosynthetic proteins. The dynamics of this process depends on the vibrational modes resonant with the energy gaps between the participating excited states. The precise structure and vibrational landscape of excitons is thus essential knowledge to understand the amazing efficiency of photosynthesis. In this work, we characterize the vibrational properties of excitons in light-harvesting proteins from purple photosynthetic bacteria, which remarkably unveil on how many bacteriochlorophylls they reside and in which proportions. Vibrational spectra obtained from bacteriochlorophylls in proteins generally contain additional vibronic contributions when compared to isolated pigments, opening additional pathways for vibrationally-assisted excitation energy transfer. In contrast, the absence of new vibronic contributions in the spectra of chlorophyll -containing photosynthetic proteins above 100 cm-1 suggests that in oxygenic photosynthesis, vibrationally-assisted excitation energy transfers occurs through vibrational modes of chlorophyll molecules in equilibrium configuration.

However, their design remains challenging due to complex resonance behaviour, strong coupling effects, and the computational cost associated with repeated full-wave electromagnetic simulations. In particular, inverse design of microring resonator-based sensors requires accurate modelling of geometry-spectrum relationships while satisfying physical constraints such as resonance conditions and spectral sensitivity requirements. In this work, we propose a physics-informed graph neural network (PI-GNN) for the inverse design of a microring resonator biosensor operating in the 1550 nm band. By representing the photonic structure as a graph and embedding resonance-based physical constraints directly into the learning objective, the model captures both structural connectivity and underlying electromagnetic principles. The proposed approach enables efficient prediction of device geometries that achieve target spectral characteristics, reducing reliance on costly simulations while maintaining physical consistency and competitive design accuracy.

Remarkably, the entire optical system remains fixed with no trainable parameters or electronic feedback, yet this single physical configuration achieves competitive performance across diverse temporal and spatiotemporal learning tasks: chaotic time-series forecasting, human action recognition, steering angle prediction, and surgical skill assessment.

    "abstract": "           Active control of scrape off layer density is emerging as a critical requirement for improving ion cyclotron resonance heating and enabling high performance steady state operation in future magnetic confinement fusion devices. Helicon wave excitation offers a promising physics based approach to generating high density boundary plasmas with high ionization efficiency and low impurity release. In this work, we develop THEMIS code, a fully three dimensional (3D) multiphysics model of helicon wave propagation and power deposition in a toroidal fusion relevant configuration, employing a finite temperature thermal dielectric tensor. The code quantifies the relative contributions of Doppler shifted cyclotron damping, anomalous Doppler damping, collisional damping, and Landau damping, and demonstrates that slow wave propagation and electron Landau damping dominate the accessible heating regime in Helimak device. A comparative study of four planar antenna geometries under the present protruding window configuration shows that geometric cutoffs and SOL density gradients severely limit power penetration into the core accessible region. To address this constraint, we introduce a recessed window launch scheme that positions the dielectric window inside the vacuum vessel and perform systematic parameter scans of window position, antenna geometry, and installation orientation. From these analyses, we identify the key physics driven principles governing efficient helicon wave coupling: the importance of open circuit termination, maximized strap length and width, controlled inter turn spacing, and sufficient clearance from metallic walls to avoid near field suppression. Guided by these principles, we designed an optimized racetrack spiral antenna that increases coupling efficiency by more than an order of magnitude compared with conventional short circuited rectangular spiral antenna.

This combination leverages the transparency of bag-of-words topics and the semantic richness of small language model embeddings. Descriptively, curiosity/learning topics show higher grades and attendance than technology/career-oriented topics; inferential tests are underpowered (e.g., linear R2 ~ 0.03; logistic pseudo-R2 ~ 0.04) so effect-size estimates should be viewed as preliminary rather than confirmatory.

Machine-learning approaches can significantly reduce the computational expense of this workflow without any loss of accuracy. We discuss various methods for constructing potential energy surfaces including transfer learning, which requires a minimal number of expensive training points. In this way, we can study chemical reactions at a high level but a low cost. In particular, as the potentials are smooth and differentiable, they enable the use of more advanced semiclassical approximations to quantum dynamics, such as perturbatively corrected instanton theory, which can capture both tunnelling and anharmonicity.

    "abstract": "           Van der Waals (vdW) materials enable nonlinear-optical engineering with unprecedented resolution: their strong second-order susceptibilities ($\\chi^{(2)}$) and twist-tunable interlayer symmetry allow the effective nonlinearity to be shaped continuously, rather than through binary $\\pm\\chi^{(2)}$ domain inversion as in bulk ferroelectrics. Here, we show that twist-angle domain engineering exploits this continuous degree of freedom to reconstruct target longitudinal nonlinearity profiles with high fidelity. Using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) as a benchmark, we demonstrate that twist-engineered vdW crystals yield significantly improved approximations of target phase-matching functions and correspondingly higher single-photon purities, particularly in compact devices where fabrication constraints limit conventional approaches. We further show that this framework remains effective in experimentally relevant vdW materials and demanding non-degenerate wavelength regimes involving mid-infrared photons. More broadly, the ability to continuously and locally program $\\chi^{(2)}$ establishes a general framework for tailoring a wide range of SPDC properties, including absolute brightness, joint spectral amplitude structure, signal-idler frequency separation, and temporal wavepacket shape beyond what is accessible in conventional nonlinear crystals. These results position vdW heterostructures as a powerful platform for engineered quantum light sources and open new opportunities for nonlinear-optical devices shaped with monolayer thickness scale.

    "abstract": "           The ability to coherently store and manipulate optical information across multiple degrees of freedom is a central requirement for scalable quantum information processing and multidimensional quantum computing. While polarization- and space-division-multiplexing have substantially increased the capacity of classical optical systems, their extension to coherent and reconfigurable photonic memories remains a key challenge. Here we demonstrate a two-spin-channel-multiplexed photonic memory based on chiral stimulated Brillouin scattering in a chiral photonic crystal fiber. Exploiting the intrinsic preservation of circular polarization in the chiral photonic crystal fiber, left- and right-circularly polarized modes serve as two orthogonal and independent storage channels. Multiple optical data pulses can be selectively or simultaneously stored and retrieved by simply controlling the polarization states of the write-read pulses. The storage time is continuously tunable, and the underlying Brillouin process preserves coherence and channel orthogonality. The result establishes chiral Brillouin scattering as an effective mechanism for spin-channel-multiplexed optoacoustic light storage, providing a robust and scalable platform for multidimensional photonic memories. It also open new opportunities for classic and quantum information processing, reconfigurable quantum networks, and hybrid light-matter interfaces based on coherent acoustic excitations.         ",

    "abstract": "           The aim of this work is to develop high precision Time-of-Flight (TOF) devices based on high refractive index solid Cherenkov radiators read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Cherenkov light is prompt and therefore ideal for reaching the intrinsic timing limits of TOF systems. By utilizing a thin, high-refractive-index radiator a nearly instantaneous signal is generated by particles exceeding the Cherenkov threshold. In order to achieve the ultimate time resolution, we carried out a rigorous optimization of the radiator material and geometry, alongside the efficiency of the optical coupling to the SiPM sensors. The key factors limiting the time resolution were characterized by comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, subsequently validated against experimental beam test data. We assembled small-scale prototypes instrumented with various Hamamatsu SiPM arrays sensors with pitches ranging from 1.3 to 3 mm coupled with various window materials, such as fused silica and MgF2, featuring various thickness values. The prototypes were successfully tested in beam test campaigns at the CERN-PS T10 beam line. The data were collected with a complete chain of front-end and readout electronics based on either the Petiroc 2A or the Radioroc 2 interfaced to a picoTDC to measure charges and times. By comparing the time measurements with two SiPM arrays we were able to measure a time resolution better than 33.2 ps at the full system level with a charged particle detection efficiency of 100%. Our results demonstrate the expected performance benchmarks for the charged particle detection efficiency and time resolution and highlight the potential of the developed Cherenkov-based TOF detectors for next-generation particle identification systems.

The choice of the orbital basis significantly affects circuit depth, with localised orbitals yielding lowest circuit depths. However, literature results point to large Trotter errors incurred by localised orbitals. Here, we therefore investigate the effect of orbital transformations on Trotter error. We consider three strategies to reduce Trotter error by orbital transformation: (i) The a priori selection of an orbital basis that produces low Trotter error. (ii) The derivation of an orbital basis that produces a ground state energy free of Trotter error (as we observed that the Trotter error is a continuous function in the Givens-rotation parameter, from which continuity of this error upon orbital transformation can be deduced). (iii) Application of propagators that change the computational basis between Trotter steps. Our numerical results show that reliably reducing Trotter error by orbital transformations is challenging. General recipes to produce low Trotter errors cannot be easily derived, despite analytical expressions which suggest ways to decrease Trotter error. Importantly, we found that localised orbital bases do not produce large Trotter errors in molecular calculations, which is an important result for efficient QPE set-ups.         ",

We show how the coupled equations for two simultaneous three-wave mixing processes can be written in terms of a STIRAP-like system, which creates robust conversion, albeit requiring long propagation distances inside a bulk crystal or waveguide. We then discuss how the time rescaling (TR) method can be modified to be applied in optical systems, then apply it in the conversion process to create a TR-STIRAP protocol, showing that full conversion is also obtained, but at a fraction of the propagation distance. We also show how the original shaping of the coupling coefficients required by the TR-STIRAP can be approximated by gaussian functions with high conversion fidelity, thus simplifying the experimental implementation. This protocol has the potential to be used in several areas, including the integration of photon sources and efficient detectors for quantum key distribution.         ",

This is particularly relevant for transition edge sensors (TESs), where the interplay of direct and inverse proximity effects governs detector sensitivity. Here, we use scanning superconducting interference device (SQUID) susceptometry to directly image the local diamagnetic response in functional S-S'-S TES structures. We resolve long range proximity coupling extending over tens of micrometers, revealing that the local transition temperature is dramatically tuned by neighboring regions, being either enhanced by superconducting (S) leads or suppressed by normal metal (N) contacts. Our observations are quantitatively supported by Ginzburg Landau modeling of the device geometry and calculations of the temperature dependent diamagnetism based on self-consistent Usadel equations.

We investigate the scaling of $\\Delta$ with system size $N$ for two paradigmatic quantum spin-glass models: the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson (2D-EA) and the all-to-all Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models. Utilizing a newly proposed unbiased energy-gap estimator for continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by high-performance sparse eigenvalue solvers, we characterize the gap distributions across disorder realizations. It is found that, in the 2D-EA case, the inverse-gap distribution develops a fat tail with infinite variance as $N$ increases. This indicates that the unfavorable super-algebraic scaling of $\\Delta$, recently reported for binary couplings [Nature 631, 749 (2024)], persists for the Gaussian disorder considered here, pointing to a universal feature of 2D spin glasses. Conversely, the SK model retains a finite-variance distribution, with the disorder-averaged gap following a rather slow power law, close to $\\Delta \\propto N^{-1/3}$. This finding provides a promising outlook for the potential efficiency of quantum annealers for optimization problems with dense connectivity.         ",

Using dichloromethane and dibromomethane-containing solutions, we produced polydisperse mixtures of monohalogenated (HC$_{2n}$X) and dihalogenated (XC$_{2n}$X) polyynes (X=Cl, Br; n=3-10). High-performance liquid chromatography enabled separation and analysis of these compounds, while chemical derivatization and mass spectrometry confirmed their molecular structures. A possible formation mechanism is proposed, involving carbon chain polymerization and termination by hydrogen and halogen atoms from atomized solvent molecules during the plasma phase.

This interaction reduces bond length alternation and moderately redshifts vibronic absorption and vibrational modes. Resonance Raman spectra show selective overtone enhancement and vibrational anharmonicity consistent with carbyne-like materials. These findings expand the synthetic approaches for halogenated carbon atomic wires and establish halopolyynes as a platform for tailoring electronic and optical properties of sp-carbon wires.

The HPP acquires its directionality from the TDS via momentum matching. It also exhibits plasmonic characteristics, with excitation frequencies following the surface-plasmon dispersion relation.

In most cases, the dynamics of the nuclear spin magnetization under the RF and gradient fields is described in a global rotating frame that cancels the effect of the static (main) magnetic field B0. In this work, we consider an alternative frame of reference, which can be called a local rotating frame where total longitudinal magnetic field (B0 plus gradient) in every voxel is zero. In this frame, the effect of time-dependent gradient field is integrated out, and the remaining magnetization dynamics, governed by much weaker RF fields, becomes both simpler and slower. We show that recasting existing RF design methods in such a frame provides useful insights and techniques that are not obvious in the conventional description. The methods we consider include (i) two-dimensional spatial RF pulse design in the excitation k-space, (ii) Shinnar-Le Roux RF design, (iii) residual phase calculation in slice-selective excitation, and (iv) iterative and numerical solutions for multi-coil RF pulse design. In particular, we show that the new formalism can substantially reduce the Bloch simulation time which can greatly benefit iterative pulse designs in parallel transmit. In all, the proposed framework provides considerable theoretical insights and practical utility for RF pulse design in MRI.         ",

    "abstract": "           Accurate extraction of the complex dielectric constant in the terahertz (THz) band is essential for material characterization and non-destructive evaluation yet remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of electromagnetic inverse problems and the limited availability of reliable reference data. In this work, a field-material couple neural network (FMCNN) is proposed to retrieve the complex dielectric constant directly from THz measurements. The FMCNN consists of a field neural network and a material neural network that are strongly coupled through the frequency-domain Maxwell equations in the form of a Helmholtz equation, with the governing physics enforced by partial differential equation (PDE) and boundary condition constraints. This formulation enables prior-free and data-free inversion, requiring only measured test data as input. The extracted dielectric constants are validated by comparison with results from a one-dimensional normal-incidence model and the Drude-Lorentz model, showing good agreement over a broad frequency range, particularly above 0.2 THz. These results demonstrate that the FMCNN provides a physics-consistent and data-efficient approach for material parameter extraction in the THz band, offering an alternative to conventional model-based methods.

    "title": "On-chip probabilistic inference for charged-particle tracking at the sensor edge",
    "abstract": "           Modern scientific instruments operate under increasingly extreme constraints on bandwidth, latency, and power. Inference at the sensor edge determines experimental data collection efficiency by deciding which information to save for further analysis. Particle tracking detectors at the Large Hadron Collider exemplify this challenge: pixelated silicon sensors generate rich spatiotemporal ionization patterns, yet most of this information is discarded due to data-rate limitations. Concurrently, advancements in co-design tools provide rapid turn-around for incorporating machine learning into application-specific integrated circuits, motivating designs for particle detectors with new integrated technologies. We demonstrate that neural networks embedded in the front-end electronics can infer charged-particle kinematic parameters from a single silicon layer. We regress hit positions and incident angles with calibrated uncertainties, while satisfying stringent constraints on numerical precision, latency, and silicon area. Our results establish a path toward probabilistic inference directly at the edge, opening new opportunities for intelligent sensing in high-rate scientific instruments.         ",

    "abstract": "           Preparing quantum states is a fundamental task in various quantum algorithms. In particular, state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators (HOs) is crucial for the creation of qudits and the implementation of high-dimensional algorithms. In this work, we develop a methodology for preparing quantum states in HOs. The HO is coupled to an auxiliary qubit to ensure that any state can be prepared in the oscillator [J. Math. Phys. 59, 072101]. By applying a sequence of square pulses to both the qubit and the HO, we drive the system from an initial state to a target state. To determine the required pulses, we use a neural network that predicts the pulse parameters needed for state preparation. Specifically, we present results for preparing qubit and qutrit states in the HO, achieving average fidelities of 99.9% and 97.0%, respectively.         ",

    "abstract": "           Preparing magnon nonclassical states is a central topic in the study of quantum magnonics. Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.         ",

To accelerate design workflows, we develop a physics-informed machine learning surrogate trained on the simulation data, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy. This combined approach reveals real-time energy exchange dynamics and reproduces key phenomena such as anti-crossing behavior and the suppression of ferromagnetic resonance under strong electromagnetic fields.

    "abstract": "           Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.
