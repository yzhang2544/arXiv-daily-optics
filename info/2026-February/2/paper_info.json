    "title": "Resonant Coupling Between Electromagnetic Waves and Protein Conformational Dynamics Revealed by Molecular Dynamics Simulations",
    "abstract": "           The biological effects of electromagnetic fields on proteins remain controversial beyond well-established thermal mechanisms, particularly with respect to frequency-dependent responses. Here, we propose that electromagnetic waves can modulate protein conformation through resonant coupling with intrinsic protein dynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to characterize spontaneous conformational fluctuations in the absence of external fields, and a tiered screening strategy combined with fast Fourier transform analysis was used to identify dominant intrinsic frequencies associated with periodically fluctuating non-covalent atom or residue pairs. Oscillating external electric fields were subsequently applied at resonant and off-resonant frequencies to evaluate conformational responses across diverse protein systems. The results demonstrate that resonant excitation induces significantly enhanced backbone conformational deviations compared to off-resonant conditions, with the effect becoming more pronounced in structurally flexible and multichain proteins. These findings provide atomistic evidence for frequency-specific resonance between electromagnetic fields and protein conformational dynamics, offering mechanistic insight into frequency-dependent electromagnetic effects and a computational framework for electromagnetic wave-based modulation of protein function.

    "title": "The Beta-Bound: Drift constraints for Gated Quantum Probabilities",
    "abstract": "           Quantum mechanics provides extraordinarily accurate probabilistic predictions, yet the framework remains silent on what distinguishes quantum systems from definite measurement outcomes. This paper develops a measurement-theoretic framework for projective gating. The central object is the $\\beta$-bound, an inequality that controls how much probability assignments can drift when gating and measurement fail to commute. For a density operator $\\rho$, projector $F$, and effect $E$, with gate-passage probability $s = {\\rm Tr}(\\rho F)$ and commutator norm $\\varepsilon = \\|[F, E]\\|$, the symmetric partial-gating drift satisfies $|\\Delta p_F(E)| \\leq 2 \\sqrt{(1 - s)/s} \\cdot \\varepsilon$. The constant 2 is sharp. We introduce two diagnostic quantities: the coherence witness $W(\\rho, F) = \\|F \\rho (I - F)\\|_1$, measuring cross-boundary coherence, and the record fidelity gap $\\Delta_T(\\rho_F, R)$, measuring expectation-value change under symmetrisation. Three experimental vignettes demonstrate falsifiability: Hong--Ou--Mandel interferometry, atomic energy-basis dephasing, and decoherence-induced classicality. The framework is operational and interpretation-neutral, compatible with Everettian, Bohmian, QBist, and collapse approaches. It provides quantitative structure that any interpretation must accommodate, along with a template for experimental tests.         ",

    "abstract": "           The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.

For OCT operation, stable amplified spontaneous emission with low spectral ripple ($<20\\%$) is maintained at drive currents below 150 mA.

Neuromorphic networks, with structures inspired by the brain's architecture, offer a compelling solution with the potential to approach the extreme energy efficiency of neurobiological systems. Photonic neuromorphic networks (PNNs) are particularly attractive because they leverage the inherent advantages of light, namely high parallelism, low latency, and exceptional energy efficiency. Previous PNN demonstrations have largely focused on device-level functionalities or system-level implementations reliant on supervised learning and inefficient optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversions. Here, we introduce a purely photonic deep PNN architecture that enables online, unsupervised learning. We propose a local feedback mechanism operating entirely in the optical domain that implements a Hebbian learning rule using non-volatile phase-change material synapses. We experimentally demonstrate this approach on a non-trivial letter recognition task using a commercially available fiber-optic platform and achieve a 100 percent recognition rate, showcasing an all-optical solution for efficient, real-time information processing. This work unlocks the potential of photonic computing for complex artificial intelligence applications by enabling direct, high-throughput processing of optical information without intermediate OEO signal conversions.

However, the accuracy and predictive capacity of such a model relies on a precise experimental characterization of the tissue's mechanical behavior. Such a characterization is yet limited by inconsistent or contradictory experimental responses reported in the literature, particularly when measurements are performed in different time or length scales. Although brain tissue has been extensively investigated in previous studies, the combination of experimental findings from different scales has received limited attention. In this study, we combine ex vivo mechanical responses of porcine brain tissue obtained at different time scales in a mechanical model. We investigated the mechanical behavior of three different brain regions in the quasi-static domain with multi-modal large strain rheometer measurements and at high frequencies with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). A comparative analysis of the mechanical parameters obtained from both experimental techniques demonstrated consistent regional variations in the viscoelastic behavior across the two domains. However, the mechanical behavior changes from a higher elasticity in the quasi-static and low frequency domain to a dominating viscosity at high frequencies. Based on the quasi-static and the high frequency behavior, we calibrated a fractional Kelvin-Voigt model and consequently unified the two responses in a single mechanical model to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the tissue's mechanical behavior.

The micrometer-scale of the source makes wakefield betatron radiation well-suited for advanced imaging techniques, including diffraction and phase-contrast imaging. Recent progress in laser technology can expand these capabilities into the attosecond regime, where the practical applications would significantly benefit from the increased energy contained within the pulse. Here we use numerical simulations combined with batch Bayesian optimization to enhance the radiation produced by an attosecond betatron source. The method enables an efficient exploration of a multi-parameter space and identifies a regime in which a plasma density spike triggers the generation of a high-charge electron beam. This results in an improvement of more than one order of magnitude in the on-axis time-averaged power within the central time containing half of the radiated energy, compared to the reference case without the density spike.

Valley photonic crystals (VPCs) offer an attractive path: by opening a gap at the Dirac points of a hexagonal lattice, one can engineer guided modes confined to domain walls that thread around corners with reduced backreflection. We develop a design framework that co-optimizes the photonic bulk band gap and valley Chern number using a modified particle-swarm optimization (PSO), while evaluating the photonic band structure via plane-wave expansion and the topological characteristics using a gauge-invariant lattice discretization to compute the Berry-curvature. The optimized structures exhibit a clean valley-Hall gap with edge bands traversing the gap and high interface transmission in full-wave simulations.

We demonstrate a new readout system, based on the McGill/Berkeley digital fMux readout, to satisfy the higher bandwidth and noise requirements of the next generation of TES-instrumented cryogenic calorimeters. The new readout samples detectors at 156 kHz, three orders of magnitude faster than its cosmology-oriented predecessor.

Thermal state reconstructions are computationally expensive. Here we transformed the basic computational element, numerical solvers, into neural operators, a class of machine learning models for learning mappings between function spaces. Focusing on a specific architecture, Fourier Neural Operators, we demonstrate that they can represent not only a surrogate model like the Stokes system of equations using a purely physics informed approach, but also discover operators without explicit mathematical formulations or even ill-posedness from data, including the direct mapping between two convecting thermal states separated by a long time interval much larger than the Courant Fredrich Lewy condition and its reversal. These neural operators significantly accelerate forward and inverse convection modeling by transforming forward physical processes into surrogate models with lower complexity while utilizing auto-differentiation to calculate gradients. With this framework, we demonstrate the strength and weaknesses of four methods for thermal state reconstructions: Reverse buoyancy, reverse convection operator, an inversion with only the terminal thermal state, and a joint inversion with the terminal thermal state and surface velocity evolution. The reverse convection operator is shown to perform poorly in the presence of observational noise, but the joint inversion overcomes this limitation. The joint technique could probably become a solution to large-scale thermal state inversion problems using seismic tomography and plate tectonic reconstructions.         ",

The results show that the excitation of TiO2 microspheres (diameter, d approx. 1 um) under TFGB illumination leads to the appearance of scattering minima in both the forward and backward directions within specific wavelength ranges. These scattering minima are found to be due to vanishing electric and magnetic dipolar coefficients associated with hybrid optical anapoles.

    "abstract": "           Optical absorption and reabsorption of light emitted from active regions in nitride laser diodes (LDs) have been shown to reduce the light extraction efficiency of these devices. It was proven that the presence of Si and Mg may considerably increase the optical absorption. This effect is much stronger in the high-energy (short-wavelength) range of the spectrum. The absorption increase is directly related to the ionization of the Si donor and Mg acceptor levels, which are controlled by the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels. It is shown that the absorption may be increased because of the higher ionization of Mg caused by the compensation in the p-type region and the high ionization of Si in the n-type region. It was explained theoretically why optical efficiency is increased by removal of doping in waveguides. It was also shown that good material quality leads to a low absorption level, especially in the Mg-doped p-type part of the device.         ",

    "abstract": "           Although photons are robust, room-temperature carriers well suited to quantum machine learning, the absence of photon-photon interactions hinder the realization of memory functionalities that are critical for capturing long-range context. Recently, measurement-based implementations of photonic quantum memristors (PQMRs) have enabled tunable non-Markovian responses. However, their memory remains confined to local elements, in contrast to biological or artificial networks where memory is shared across the system. Here, we propose a scalable PQMR network that enables measurement-based memory sharing. Each memristive node updates its internal state using the history of its own and neighbouring quantum states, thereby realizing distributed memory. By modelling each node as a photonic quantum memtransistor, we demonstrate pronounced enhancements in both classical and quantum hysteresis at the device level, as well as enhanced network-level quantum hysteresis. Implemented as a quantum reservoir, the architecture achieves improved Fashion-MNIST classification accuracy and confidence via increased data separability. Our approach paves the way toward high-capacity quantum machine learning using memristive devices compatible with linear-optical quantum computing.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum adiabatic optimization has long been expected to outperform classical methods in solving NP-type problems. While this has been proven in certain experiments, its main applications still reside in academic problems where the size of the system to be solved would not represent an obstacle to any modern desktop computer. Here we develop a systematic procedure to find the global optima of the modularity function to discover community structure in complex networks solely relying on pure annealers rather than hybrid solutions. We bypass the one-hot encoding constraints by hierarchically and recursively encoding binary instances of the problem that can be solved without the need to guess the exact penalties for the Lagrange multipliers. We study the variability, and robustness of the annealing process as a function of network size, directness of connections, topology, and the resolution of the communities. We show how our approach produces meaningful and at least equally optimal solutions to state-of-the-art community detection algorithms while maintaining tractable computing times. Lastly, due to its recursive nature, the annealing process returns intermediate subdivisions thus offering interpretable rather than black-box solutions. These \\textit{dendrograms} can be used to unveil normal and pathological hidden hierarchies in brain networks hence opening the door to clinical workflows. Overall, this represents a first step towards an applicable practice-oriented usage of pure quantum annealing potentially bridging two segregated communities in modern science and engineering; that of network science and quantum computing.

Here, by paraxial-nonparaxial transition we mean a gradual loss of validity of the paraxial approximation such that it is necessary to solve Maxwell-consistently employing the dyadic Green's function. The vortex number appears to increase approximately with a cubic root of the propagation distance for sufficiently small correlation length. Furthermore, a kink appears in nucleation rate at the position of maximum scintillation upon increasing correlation length. A driven steady state is reached due to the filtering of evanescent waves upon propagation.

    "abstract": "           Background In vivo mechanical behaviour of the abdominal wall has been poorly characterised and important details are missing regarding the occurrence and post-operative recurrence rate of hernias which can be as high as 30 %. This study aimed to assess the correlation between abdominal wall displacement and intra-abdominal pressure, as well as abdominal compliance. Methods Eighteen healthy participants performed audio-guided passive (breathing) and active (coughing, Valsalva maneuver) exercises. Axial dynamic changes of abdominal muscles and visceral area were measured using MRI, and intra-abdominal pressure with ingested pressure sensor. Findings Correlations between abdominal wall displacement and intra-abdominal pressure were specific to participant, exercise, and varying between rectus abdominis and lateral muscles. Strong correlations were found between rectus abdominis displacement and intra-abdominal pressure during breathing (r = 0.92 $\\pm$ 0.06), as well as lateral muscles displacement with intra-abdominal pressure during coughing and Valsalva maneuver (r = --0.98 $\\pm$ 0.03 and -- 0.94 $\\pm$ 0.05 respectively). The abdominal pseudo-compliance varied greatly among participants during muscular contraction, the coefficient of variation reaching up to 70 %. Interpretation The combination of intra-abdominal pressure and dynamic MRI measurements enables the identification of participant-specific behaviour pattern. Intra-abdominal pressure and abdominal wall dynamic undergo consistent and predictable interactions. However, this relationship is subject-specific and may not be extrapolated to other individuals. Therefore, both intra-abdominal pressure and abdominal wall motion must be measured in the same participant in order to accurately characterise the abdominal wall behaviour. These results are of great importance for mesh design, surgical decision-making, and personalised healthcare.         ",

    "abstract": "           High laser intensities enable the production of electron-positron pairs from bright gamma rays passing through strong fields. Potentially the most promising approach for all-optical experiments in the near term uses dense but higher divergence electron beams from laser wakefield acceleration to produce gamma rays through inverse Compton scattering. Achieving many-photon collisions between these gamma rays and the high intensity laser pulse in practice is extremely difficult, however, due to significant shot-to-shot jitter in laser pointing and timing. We model these practical difficulties using simulated Monte-Carlo experiments. By using a more efficient algorithm for sampling infrequent pair production with particle splitting, we enable the exploration of a multi-dimensional parameter space. Using Gaussian Process Regression we then efficiently find optimal conditions for maximising pair production by changing the laser spot size, the energy in the colliding beam, and the stand-off distance between the laser wakefield accelerator and the focus of the colliding laser pulse. We find that the optimal stand-off distance increases with the degree of laser jitter and that the best conditions for producing electron-positron pairs are not the same as the best conditions for maximising the energy in the gamma rays. With \\unit[100]{J} of laser energy, we estimate rates of pair production of around 1 pair per 100 electrons are achievable even with jitter of 10s of microns and 10s of femtoseconds.         ",

However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a Szegedy quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, and does not require further reversible computing methods.

A substantial enhancement of exciton-photon coupling can be achieved with photonic cavities, where excitons hybridize with cavity modes to form polariton states. To provide a theoretical framework for interpreting emerging experimental efforts in this direction, we develop a scattering theory describing the interaction of frequency-entangled photon pairs with cavity polariton and bipolariton states under various coupling regimes. Employing the Tavis-Cummings model in combination with our scattering approach, we present a quantitative analysis of how the interaction of the entangled photon pair with the polariton/bipolariton modifies its joint spectral amplitude (JSA). Specifically, we examine the effects of the cavity-mode steady-state population, exciton-cavity coupling strength, and different forms of the input photon JSA. Our results show that the entanglement entropy of the scattered photons is highly sensitive to the interplay between the input JSA and the spectral line shapes of the polariton resonances, emphasizing the cavity filtering effects. We suggest that biphoton scattering quantum light spectroscopy best serves as a sensitive probe of polariton and bipolariton states in the photon-vacuum cavity state. Our approach is not only robust to various regimes of cavity-exciton coupling, but also amenable to extensions beyond the Tavis-Cummings model, enabling the representation of a broad class of molecular systems and solid state quantum materials.
