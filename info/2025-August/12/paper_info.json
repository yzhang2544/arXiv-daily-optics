    "title": "High-density and scalable graphene Hall sensor arrays through monolithic CMOS integration",
    "abstract": "           Electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials (2DMs) significantly outperform their silicon counterparts; however, silicon CMOS technology remains commercially predominant as it offers the capability to operate dense arrays of devices in a scalable fashion. In particular, graphene Hall sensors (GHSs) offer great improvements in magnetic field sensitivity and resolution compared to silicon Hall-effect sensors, making them extremely appealing for magnetic field imaging and biosensing. At present, GHS arrays have limited scalability compared to silicon CMOS since they require planar routing for biasing and multiplexing. In this work, we explore strategies to realize high-density graphene Hall sensor arrays by vertically connecting GHSs with silicon CMOS biasing and multiplexing circuitry, allowing the routing and circuitry to scale with the array. We investigate the importance of design choices in the chip layout and post-fabrication process in maximizing the reliability of graphene transfer onto mm-scale CMOS dies. Our experimental results validate the success of the integration process by showing for the first time that GHSs can be monolithically integrated with CMOS with high yield to form sensor arrays. We expect that these results will lead to further improvements in magnetic sensing technology and broader advancements in large-scale heterogeneous 2DM-CMOS systems.         ",

    "title": "Citation Issues in Wave Mechanics Theory of Microwave Absorption",
    "abstract": "           The wave mechanics theory of microwave absorption challenges the long-standing impedance-matching and quarter-wavelength paradigms by demonstrating that conventional models mistakenly conflate bulk material parameters with thin-film phenomena. Drawing on a corpus of 35 peer-reviewed papers and preprints, the study performs a citation-pattern analysis and a logical audit of established theory. Results reveal a striking asymmetry in scholarly engagement, only a handful of supportive or neutral citations appear amid widespread silence, alongside critical logical flaws in impedance matching, notably its inconsistent treatment of penetration, reflection, and absorption from film. By re-framing absorption as a wave-mechanics process governed by interference at parallel interfaces, the wave mechanics framework restores energy-conservation consistency and provides experimentally verified design rules for film thickness, phase response, and broadband performance. The paper further situates the citation neglect within broader issues of peer-review bias and paradigm inertia, illustrating how cargo-cult scientific practices can impede theoretical progress. Recommendations are offered for researchers, editors, and institutions to foster open discourse, rigorously test competing models, and update curricula and design tools accordingly.         ",

    "abstract": "           The sPHENIX collaboration has been taking data since 2023 at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in BNL to study the Quark-Gluon Plasma and cold Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The tracking system of sPHENIX consists of a time projection chamber, a MAPS-based vertex detector, and an intermediate silicon tracker (INTT). Together with the sPHENIX full barrel calorimeter system, the measurement of the heavy-flavor jets and the upsilon-state identification are enabled. INTT, surrounding the collision point azimuthally at approximately 10 cm away with two layers of silicon strip sensors, detects hit points in the intermediate area of the tracking system to enhance tracking precision. Thanks to the good timing resolution of INTT, it also provides timing information to corresponding hits of other tracking detectors. This capability eliminates pile-up events due to misidentifying bunch crossings. This proceeding discusses the achievements of INTT using Au+Au collision data taken in 2023, and the status of INTT commissioning with proton+proton collisions in 2024.         ",

    "abstract": "           A wide range of methods currently exist for testing the presence of malaria, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. New technologies are urgently needed to develop more effective diagnosis tools to fight and eradicate malaria. Optical biosensors that employ surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques are a promising category of devices for detecting malaria biomarkers. One such biomarker is plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), a protein produced during the life cycle of the malaria parasite, which is a metabolic enzyme found in all plasmodium species, including the most widespread falciparum. This work reports on the design, probing, and experimental performance of an optical biosensor for detecting pLDH based on SPR and extraordinary optical transmission. The biosensor is composed of an aluminum metasurface made from an array of nanoholes. The sensor operates in the visible spectral region and achieves label-free sensing of plasmodium falciparum LDH (pfLDH) spiked in phosphate-buffered saline. The sensor has a spectral sensitivity of 360 nm/RIU and an LOD of 1.3 nM, equivalent to 45.6 ng/mL of pfLDH. This type of optical biosensor may offer a cost-effective and high sensitivity method for active infection diagnosis.         ",

Here, we propose and fabricate a 16-channel programmable incoherent photonic neuromorphic computing chip by co-designing a simplified MZI mesh and distributed feedback lasers with saturable absorber array using different materials, enabling implementation of both linear and nonlinear spike computations in the optical domain. Furthermore, previous studies mainly focused on supervised learning and simple image classification tasks. Here, we propose a photonic spiking reinforcement learning (RL) architecture for the first time, and develop a software-hardware collaborative training-inference framework to address the challenge of training spiking RL models. We achieve large-scale, energy-efficient (photonic linear computation: 1.39 TOPS/W, photonic nonlinear computation: 987.65 GOPS/W) and low-latency (320 ps) end-to-end deployment of an entire layer of photonic spiking RL. Two RL benchmarks include the discrete CartPole task and the continuous Pendulum tasks are demonstrated experimentally based on spiking proximal policy optimization algorithm. The hardware-software collaborative computing reward value converges to 200 (-250) for the CartPole tasks, respectively, comparable to that of a traditional PPO algorithm. This experimental demonstration addresses the challenge of the absence of large-scale photonic nonlinear spike computation and spiking RL training difficulty, and presents a high-speed and low-latency photonic spiking RL solution with promising application prospects in fields such as real-time decision-making and control for robots and autonomous driving.

However, the amplification of narrow-linewidth pulses is primarily limited by stimulated Brillouin scattering, which causes pulse instabilities, back-reflected pulses, and catastrophic damage effects on optical components. In this work, we present a 1.6 mJ narrow-linewidth nanosecond pulsed fiber laser system based on all-glass spun tapered double-clad fibers without employing any mitigating technique for the stimulated Brillouin scattering effect. The system delivers pulses with an 8 ns duration at a 100 kHz repetition rate, over 97.5% degree of polarization, a beam quality factor of M2 = 1.3, a spectral linewidth of 53.8 MHz, a 160 W average power, and 188 kW peak power with a slope efficiency of 97.6%.

Here, we show that the inherent ability of heterogeneous angular spectrum approach to incorporate in plane varying speed-of-sound maps and support rapid differentiable optimization of lens thickness profiles can generate lens topologies for high fidelity acoustic holography. Crucially, we show that this framework can also account for wavefront aberrations in the propagation media, providing the opportunity to reconfigure this disruptive technology for high precision neuro-interventions. Our investigations also revealed that low frequency acoustic feedback generated by nonlinear mixing of high frequency waves allows attaining accurate skull-compensating lens alignment and creates the possibility to monitor CSF fluid build-up and removal in hydrocephalus.

    "abstract": "           Optical atomic clocks deliver unrivaled precision, yet their size and complexity still confine them to specialized laboratories. Frequency combs provide the crucial optical-to-microwave division needed for clock readout, but conventional fiber- or bulk-laser combs are far too large for portable use. The advent of chip-integrated microcombs, frequency combs generated in micron-scale resonators, has revolutionized this landscape, enabling fully miniaturized, low-power clocks that bridge optical and radio-frequency domains on a single chip. Nevertheless, stabilizing a microcomb solely through pump laser control entangles otherwise independent feedback parameters, injects extra technical noise, and prevents flexible partial division of the optical frequency. Here, we propose and demonstrate a universal on-chip optical-clock architecture that supports both partial and full optical division. A hybrid passive-active scheme enables locking any two microcomb teeth independently, eliminating cross-coupling of control loops. Using the pump laser as a nonlinear actuator to stabilize an arbitrary tooth, we achieve a residual relative frequency instability of 1e-16. This advance brings integrated optical clocks closer to real-world deployment and opens new avenues for precision timing and navigation.         ",

    "abstract": "           Linear response (LR) is an important tool in the computational chemist's toolbox. It is therefore no surprise that the emergence of quantum computers has led to a quantum version, quantum LR (qLR). However, the current quantum era of near-term intermediary scale quantum (NISQ) computers is dominated by noise, short decoherence times, and slow measurement speed. It is therefore of interest to find approximations that greatly reduce the quantum workload while only slightly impacting the quality of a method. In an effort to achieve this, we approximate the naive qLR with singles and doubles (qLRSD) method by either directly approximating the reduced density matrices (RDMs) or indirectly through their respective reduced density cumulants (RDCs). We present an analysis of the measurement costs behind qLR with RDMs, and report qLR results for model Hydrogen ladder systems; for varying active space sizes of OCS, SeH$_2$, and H$_2$S; and for symmetrically stretched H$_2$O and BeH$_2$. Discouragingly, while approximations to the 4-body RDMs and RDCs seem to produce good results for systems at the equilibrium geometry and for some types of core excitations, they both tend to fail when the system exhibits strong correlation. All approximations to the 3-body RDMs and/or RDCs severely affect the results and cannot be applied.         ",

Based on analytical solutions to the non-Abelian Landau dressed states beyond the continuum limit, we reveal chiral photon emission and vortices with emergent nonreciprocity enabled by selective coupling between emitters and spin-momentum-locked bands. When coexisting with Abelian and non-Abelian magnetic fields, emitters hybridize with Landau dressed orbits to form spin-polarized, squeezed Landau polaritons that carry quantized angular momenta, with Rabi frequencies tunable via Landau levels and pseudospin interactions. Multi-emitter dynamics further exhibit collective phenomena governed by real-space staggered phases induced by nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry.

In optical lattice clocks, precise characterization of atomic temperature is required to minimize systematic uncertainties at the $10^{-18}$ level. In this work, we investigate atomic temperature measurements in the ytterbium optical lattice clock developed at INRIM, IT-Yb1, employing sideband and Doppler spectroscopy across a wide range of trapping conditions. By implementing clock-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling, we reduce the atomic temperature and enable operation at shallower lattice depths down to $D = 50E_{R}$. We compare temperature estimates obtained from the harmonic oscillator model with those derived using a Born-Oppenheimer-based approach, which is expected to provide a more accurate description of atomic motion in both longitudinal and radial directions, especially for hotter atoms whose motion deviates from the harmonic regime. Discrepancies up to a factor of two in extracted temperatures are observed depending on the chosen model. We assess the impact of these modeling differences on the evaluation of lattice frequency shifts and find deviations up to $8\\times10^{-17}$. Even though extended Sisyphus cooling reduces these inconsistencies to the $1\\times10^{-18}$ level or below, residual biases may still limit the accuracy of optical lattice clocks.         ",

We measured losses of 1 dB/cm (TE polarization) and 1.3 dB/cm (TM polarization) at 8.5 um. Substantially lower losses, 0.28 dB/cm, were measured at wavelength = 4.6 um (TM polarization). We then implemented racetrack resonators with straight evanescent couplers. We obtained loaded quality factors larger than 600.000 at wavelength = 4.6 um.

For the first time, the system performance is analyzed by studying the spectral features of the reflected light by live single cells. We demonstrate that the presence of the actin cortex, needed for cell migration, in different types of cancer cells significantly affect their optical response, enabling high sensitivity and specificity in cell classification.

A complete agreement with the predictive apparatus of standard quantum mechanics, including the uncertainty principle and the probabilistic Born rule, is then said to emerge from these equations, without having to confer any special status to measurements or observers. Two key elements behind the proof of this complete agreement are absolute uncertainty and the POVM theorem. The former involves an alleged \"naturally emerging, irreducible limitation on the possibility of obtaining knowledge within pilot-wave theory\" and the latter establishes that the outcome distributions of all measurements are described by POVMs. Here, we argue that the derivations of absolute uncertainty and the POVM theorem depend upon the questionable assumption that \"information is always configurationally grounded\". We explain in detail why the offered rationale behind such an assumption is deficient and explore the consequences of having to let go of it.         ",

However, weaving irregular curved surfaces has been difficult, with prior alternatives requiring curved ribbons and triaxial weaving patterns. In this work, we present a simple strategy to achieve complex spatial curvature by purposely introducing 'snags', a traditionally unwanted textile defect, into dense plain weaves consisting of straight ribbons assembled in a straightforward biaxial network. We detail the fabrication methodology where we pull out ribbons of initially smooth two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) plain weaves to form local snags. We show that these local defects cause global curvatures through the propagation of geometric frustration. We then use a reduced-order bar & hinge model to simulate the mechanics-guided deformation of snagged plain weaves, and we investigate how the curvature scales with system parameters such as the thickness and Young's modulus of the ribbons. Finally, we introduce an inverse design platform where an evolutionary algorithm is used to inversely compute the optimal snag patterns of smooth plain weaves to approximate arbitrary target surfaces including 2D and 3D woven exoskeletons that fit human legs and elbows, respectively. Engineering snags in plain weaves as a general strategy can pave the way for future design of customizable wearable devices, adaptive soft robots, reconfigurable architecture, and more.         ",

Based on the spatial variation characteristics of eigenfunctions with frequency, a sound source depth estimation method matching the cutoff frequency of normal modes is proposed.

To leading order, the required time scales linearly with the length of the chain. Such a fast, high-quality quantum state transfer is based on the ballistic propagation of the wave packet centred in the linear region of the dispersion relation by means of the on-site magnetic field. At the same time, the wave packet width, modulated by the inter-site couplings at the chain ends, whose values are found via a carefully designed genetic algorithm, is constrained mostly in the linear region of the dispersion relation. Our coupling scheme is shown to hold for arbitrary values of the next-nearest inter-site coupling and can be straightforwardly applied to longer range coupling schemes.         ",

By revealing influences of the liquid-layer loading on wave velocity of SAW and topological indices (Berry curvature and Chern number) of topological interface-modes, a topological resonance peak with a high Q-factor is obtained based on couplings of a topological interface-mode waveguide and a resonant cavity under a surface liquid-layer loading. The results show that the degree of spatial-inversion-symmetry breaking resulting from structure parameters has an obvious influences on the topological resonance Q-factor, while the influences of the thickness of the liquid-layer loading on that is weak. It is worth noting that the topological resonance frequency is significantly sensitive to the liquid parameters. Based on that, a novel topological-resonance SAW liquid-phase sensor is proposed. Furthermore, sensing performances of this kind of sensor are simulated, which are used to sensing the concentration of hemoglobin, albumin, NaCl and NaI in aqueous solutions, and high sensitivities and Q-factors are obtained.

By arranging $n$ precisely fabricated rectangular plates, a nearly ideal magnetic quadrupole field with a substantial gradient can be created at center. This robust and rapidly tunable field configuration is well suited for two-dimensional magneto-optical trapping (2D-MOT) and magnetic guiding of cold atoms. By aligning an optical nanofiber (ONF) along the zero-field line of a planar 2D-MOT in a 2-plate assembly, we demonstrate quasi-continuous, field-free operation of the quantum optical interface without switching off the magnetic field. Transient transmission spectroscopy with nanosecond laser pulses is performed on the $^{87}$Rb D2 line at a measurement repetition rate as high as 250 kHz. The observed line broadening, while not yet fully understood, is partially attributed to residual magnetic fields in the $n=2$ assembly. Through additional measurements and simulations, we verify that these residual fields can be fully eliminated in an $n=4$ assembly, resulting in an ultra-straight 2D trap that supports uniform light-atom interaction over exceptionally long, field-free distances. We extend our discussion to $n=6$, $n=8$ designs with similar uniformity but multiple zero-field lines.

    "abstract": "           Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has become a powerful tool for investigating the optical properties of thin films, offering direct access to the complex permittivity in the terahertz range. However, in transmission-based measurements of thin films on thick substrates, multiple reflections and limited time windows can introduce artifacts that obscure resonant features such as phonon modes. Time-domain windowing remains one of the most widely adopted strategies to mitigate these effects, yet systematic guidelines on its application remain scarce. In this work, we organize a practical routine for extracting the complex permittivity from THz-TDS data, focusing on when and how to apply time-domain windowing. The routine incorporates decision points for truncation versus smooth apodization, and emphasizes tailoring the window length and shape to specific signal conditions. We demonstrate the approach using representative measurements on PbTe thin films, highlighting cases in which truncation suffices, where apodization is essential, and how different window functions and lengths influence the resulting spectra. We also propose simple metrics to assess signal continuity and guide window selection. Although other analysis techniques exist, including parametric spectral estimation, this study focuses on formalizing windowing-based processing into an accessible experimental workflow. Our results show that the choice of window parameters can significantly affect the accuracy of extracted material parameters, particularly for sharply resonant systems. This work provides an accessible framework for improving spectral fidelity in THz-TDS of thin-film samples.         ",

    "abstract": "           The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.

    "abstract": "           This paper is the first of several parts introducing a new powerful algebra: the algebra of the pseudo-observables. This is a C*-algebra whose set is formed by formal expressions involving observables. The algebra is constructed by applying the Occam's razor principle, in order to obtain the minimal description of physical reality. Proceeding in such a manner, every aspect of quantum mechanics acquires a clear physical interpretation or a logical explanation, providing, for instance, in a natural way the reason for the structure of complex algebra and the matrix structure of the formulation of Werner Heisenberg of quantum mechanics. Last but not least, the very general hypotheses assumed, allow one to state that quantum mechanics is the unique minimal description of physical reality.         ",

    "title": "Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction with Antiferromagnets",
    "abstract": "           The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.         ",

    "abstract": "           We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in multiband superconductors with a nontrivial topological Euler class. We introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with the Euler invariant signified by a nontrivial quantum geometry. We then demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity universally admits a topological jump originating from the Euler class in the presence of $d$-wave superconducting pairings, and naturally differs from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the noninteracting bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can result in enhanced nonlinear currents that fingerprint the exotic topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler superconductors.         ",

Unlike previous approaches, our method imposes no symmetry assumptions, such as translational invariance, on the quantum systems. This technique is scalable to large systems through the use of a matrix product operator representation of the reference time evolution propagator. Our optimization routine is applied to various spin chains and fermionic systems described by the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the spinful Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. In these cases, our approach achieves a relative error improvement of up to four orders of magnitude for systems of 50 qubits, although our method is also applicable to larger systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to molecular systems, specifically lithium hydride, achieving an error improvement of up to eight orders of magnitude. This proof of concept highlights the potential of our approach for broader applications in quantum simulations.         ",

    "abstract": "           We investigate the steady-state optical response of a Laguerre-Gaussian vortex cavity system integrated with cold atoms featuring a double-$\\Lambda$ energy level structure. Within this hybrid system, the atoms are driven by cavity mode and three coherent vortex beams, each carrying independent orbital angular momentum (OAM). We first check the steady-state output spectrum of the hybrid system in the passive/active case (without/with external cavity driving). Our findings reveal that the optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) spectrum is modulated by the OAM difference $(\\Delta \\ell\\hbar)$ from the atomic component throughout the four-wave mixing (FWM) process. The resulting loop phase ($\\Delta \\ell\\theta$) can achieve a switching effect on the absorption and gain behavior of the hybrid system for the probe beam. Additionally, the group delay, indicative of fast/slow light phenomena, is also tuned by $\\Delta \\ell$. We further display how the atomic OAM modulates the periodicity of the output spot pattern in the hybrid system. This research provides valuable insights into the modulation of optical responses in Laguerre-Gaussian vortex cavity systems.         ",

The system is built on a novel cognitive architecture featuring a hierarchical memory framework that enables flexible task decomposition, adaptive tool selection, post-analysis, and autonomous file handling and submission. El Agente Q is benchmarked on six university-level course exercises and two case studies, demonstrating robust problem-solving performance (averaging >87% task success) and adaptive error handling through in situ debugging. It also supports longer-term, multi-step task execution for more complex workflows, while maintaining transparency through detailed action trace logs. Together, these capabilities lay the foundation for increasingly autonomous and accessible quantum chemistry.         ",

Exact Diagonalization is employed as the classical benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of the quantum algorithms. We perform simulations across a range of molecular geometries, basis sets, and active spaces to compare each algorithm's performance and accuracy, and to enhance the detectability of CIs. This work confirms the quantum variational algorithms' capability of describing conical intersections in both molecules, as long as appropriate active spaces and geometries of the molecule are chosen. We also compare the accuracy and reliability of VQE-based methods for computing excited states with classical benchmark methods, and we demonstrate good agreement within desired regions.         ",

Scalable quantum photonics demands all three, to enable high computational clock rates and resource efficient scaling to large systems. We present a cavity-based optical switch that overcomes this limitation, demonstrating 22 ns rise time, insertion loss of 2.4 dB, and 17.5 dB extinction ratio. All-optical control is achieved via phase modulation of a signal field detuned from the near-degenerate two-photon absorption ladder in warm rubidium vapor. The ultimate performance of our switch, combining both speed and efficiency, will find applications in active multiplexing, loop-based quantum memory, and feedforward for quantum error-correction protocols.
