Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of cavity-controlled co-to-core resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). We eliminate the effects of the absorption edge by monitoring the RIXS profile, thereby resolving the resonant state from the overlapping continuum. We observe distinct cavity-induced energy shifts and cavity-enhanced decay rate in the $2p3d$ RIXS spectra of WSi$_{2}$. These effects, manifesting as stretched or shifted profiles in the RIXS planes, enable novel spectroscopic applications by cavity-controlled core-hole states. Our results establish core-to-core RIXS as a powerful tool for manipulating inner-shell dynamics in x-ray cavities, offering new avenues for integrating quanutm optical effects with x-ray spectroscopy.

    "abstract": "           Modelling the effects of perturbations on optical fields often requires learning highly oscillatory complex-valued functions. Standard multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) struggle with this task due to an inherent spectral bias, preventing them from fitting high-frequency sinusoids. To overcome this, we incorporate Fourier features - a set of predefined sinusoids dependent on the perturbation - as an additional network input. This reframes the learning problem from approximating a complex function to finding a linear combination of basis functions. We demonstrate this method by training a Fourier Feature Network to predict the transmission matrix of a multimode fibre under mechanical compression. Compared to a standard MLP, our network reduces prediction error in the output field's amplitude and phase by an order of magnitude, achieving a mean complex correlation of 0.995 with the ground truth, despite using 85% fewer parameters. This approach offers a general and robust method for accurately modelling a wide class of oscillatory physical systems.         ",

Inspired by this paradigm, we propose a physically-based inverse rendering (IR) framework, the first ever platform for PET image reconstruction using this http URL, for PET image reconstruction. Our method integrates Monte Carlo sampling with an analytical projector in the forward rendering process to accurately model photon transport and physical process in the PET system. The emission image is iteratively optimized using voxel-wise gradients obtained via automatic differentiation, eliminating the need for manually derived update equations. The proposed framework was evaluated using both phantom studies and clinical brain PET data acquired from a Siemens Biograph mCT scanner. Implementing the Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) algorithm across both the CASToR toolkit and our IR framework, the IR reconstruction achieved a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and improved image quality compared to CASToR reconstructions. In clinical evaluation compared with the Siemens Biograph mCT platform, the IR reconstruction yielded higher hippocampal standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) and gray-to-white matter ratios (GWR), indicating enhanced tissue contrast and the potential for more accurate tau localization and Braak staging in Alzheimer's disease assessment. The proposed IR framework offers a physically interpretable and extensible platform for high-fidelity PET image reconstruction, demonstrating strong performance in both phantom and real-world scenarios.

More recently, the outstanding mechanical and optical properties of superfluid helium, such as low mechanical dissipation and low optical absorption, have positioned superfluid helium as a promising material platform in applications ranging from dark matter and gravitational wave detection to quantum computation. However, experiments with superfluid helium incur a high barrier to entry as they require incorporation of complex optical and electrical setups within a hermetically sealed cryogenic chamber to confine the superfluid. Here, we report on the design and construction of a helium chamber setup for operation inside a dilution refrigerator at Millikelvin temperatures, featuring electrical and optical fiber access. By incorporating an automated gas handling system, we can precisely control the amount of helium gas inserted into the chamber, rendering our setup particularly promising for experiments with superfluid helium thin films, such as superfluid thin film optomechanics. Using silicon nanophotonic resonators, we demonstrate precise control and in-situ tuning of the thickness of a superfluid helium film on the sub-nanometer level. By making use of the exceptional tunability of the superfluid film thickness, we demonstrate optomechanically induced phonon lasing of phononic crystal cavity third sound modes in the superfluid film and show that the lasing threshold crucially depends on the film thickness. The large internal volume of our chamber (V_chamber = 1l) is adaptable for integration of various optical and electrical measurement and control techniques. Therefore, our setup provides a versatile platform for a variety of experiments in fundamental and applied superfluid helium research.         ",

    "abstract": "           Optical phased array (OPA) is a promising technology for compact, solid-state beam steering, with applications ranging from free-space optical communication to LiDAR. However, simultaneously achieving a large field of view (FOV), high resolution, and low side-lobe level (SLL) remains a major challenge. Traditional OPAs face inherent limitations: they exhibit grating lobes when emitter spacing exceeds half the operating wavelength, while at half-wavelength spacing, significant crosstalk issues persist. Previously, we demonstrated a small-scale OPA that harnesses near-field interference and beamforming via a trapezoidal slab grating and a half-wavelength-pitch waveguide array to achieve a 180\u00b0 FOV. However, its resolution was limited by the small channel count. In this work, we present a 1000-channel OPA that scales this architecture while addressing key challenges in waveguide crosstalk and control complexity. By optimizing waveguide routing, we minimize inter-channel coupling in the dense waveguide array. Additionally, we propose and demonstrate a passive matrix control scheme using 20 row and 50 column pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals to arbitrarily control 1000 thermo-optic phase shifters, significantly simplifying the electronic control and packaging. Our OPA achieves grating-lobe-free beam steering across a full 180\u00b0 FOV, with a high resolution of 0.07\u00b0 * 0.17\u00b0 and a minimum SLL of -18.7 dB at 0\u00b0.

Efficient management of quantum resources, both physical (qubits, error rates, connectivity) and logical (quantum gates, algorithms, error correction), becomes particularly relevant in the design and deployment of quantum algorithms. In this work, we analyze the role of resources in the various uses of NISQ devices today, identifying their relevance and implications for software engineering focused on the use of quantum computers. We propose a vision for runtime-aware quantum software development, identifying key challenges to its realization, such as limited introspection capabilities and temporal constraints in current platforms.

We theoretically investigate the deterministic preparation of superradiant and subradiant states of two dipole-coupled two-level quantum emitters at deep-subwavelength separation using the Swing-UP of Quantum Emitter Population (SUPER) excitation scheme. Utilizing suitable pulse parameters for two red-detuned, time-overlapping Gaussian pulses, the SUPER scheme enables close-to-unity population inversion in the targeted collective eigenstates. Furthermore, a tunable optical phase in the SUPER scheme enables the simultaneous inversions in both pure super- and subradiant states with finite populations, thereby resulting in the preparation of hybrid collective states. These results are possible to realize with or without an optical cavity. Our approach to populating the collective eigenstates in a cavity environment paves the way for the efficient preparation of these states in the presence of environmental decoherence.

Here, we investigate the computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems, focusing on two physically relevant parameters, correlation length and mixing time, and explore whether it can be comparable (or even lower) to that of simulating their closed counterparts. In particular, we study the role of dissipation in simulating open-system dynamics using both quantum and classical methods, where the classical complexity is characterised by the bond dimension and operator entanglement entropy. Our results show that dissipation affects correlation length and mixing time in distinct ways at intermediate and long timescales. Moreover, we observe numerically that in classical tensor network simulations, classical complexity does not decrease with stronger dissipation, revealing a separation between quantum and classical resource scaling.

    "abstract": "           The paper evaluates the thermal regime of a cryogenically cooled copper photocathode integrated into a continuous-wave superconducting radio-frequency injector cavity with direct thermal contact. Such a photoinjector layout is being developed at DESY and has recently demonstrated a record-high 50 MV/m axial electric field in radio-frequency tests, marking an important milestone. To address the thermal effect of the picosecond excitation laser, we first develop a two-temperature model to describe the temperature of the emitting surface at cryogenic temperatures and solve it numerically. Subsequently, we present a one-temperature model of the bulk photocathode coupled with an electromagnetic model of the injector cavity. For the current injector design, we predict a negligible impact of the laser on the intrinsic quality factor of the cavity, identifying instead the cryogenic stability of the copper cathode as the primary operational limit. To overcome cooling challenges, we propose an improved configuration of the cathode plug. For the proposed geometry, the multiphysics analysis confirms stable performance at a nominal 2 W laser power, sufficient for 100 pC beams at 1 MHz under optimistic quantum efficiency assumptions. Operation at higher laser loads will benefit from further dedicated cryogenic analysis.         ",

    "abstract": "           Temperature rise of qubits due to heating is a critical issue in large-scale quantum computers based on quantum-dot (QD) arrays. This leads to shorter coherence times, induced readout errors, and increased charge noise. Here, we propose a simple thermal circuit model to describe the heating effect on silicon QD array structures. Noting that the QD array is a periodic structure, we represent it as a thermal distributed-element circuit, forming a thermal transmission line. We validate this model by measuring the electron temperature in a QD array device using Coulomb blockade thermometry, finding that the model effectively reproduces experimental results. This simple and scalable model can be used to develop the thermal design of large-scale silicon-based quantum computers.         ",

    "title": "Quantum theory of surface lattice resonances",
    "abstract": "           The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \\textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. We further show, using a perturbative approach that explicitly accounts for population dynamics, how the resulting switching dynamics can be observed and characterized in pump-probe experiments. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.

    "title": "Probing the Linewidth of the 12.4-keV Solid-State $^{45}$Sc Isomeric Resonance",
    "abstract": "           The $^{45}$Sc nuclear transition from the ground to the isomeric state at 12.389~keV, with a lifetime of 0.46~s, exhibits an extraordinarily narrow natural width of 1.4~feV and a quality factor $\\simeq 10^{19}$ -- surpassing those of the most precise atomic clocks -- making $^{45}$Sc a compelling platform for advanced metrology and nuclear clocks. Here we investigate how closely the spectral width and quality factor of the solid-state $^{45}$Sc resonance can approach these natural limits. Using the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser, we confirm the isomer's lifetime via time-delayed incoherent $K_{\\alpha,\\beta}$ fluorescence and observe previously unreported elastic fluorescence, yielding a partial internal conversion coefficient of 390(60). The absence of a clear nuclear forward scattering signal beyond a 2-ms delay implies environmental broadening of at least $500~\\Gamma_{0}$ under experimental conditions, placing bounds on solid-state decoherence mechanisms. These findings set new experimental benchmarks for solid-state nuclear clock development.         ",
