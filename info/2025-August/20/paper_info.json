    "abstract": "           Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to revolutionize biological research and medical diagnostics. Thanks to their high sensitivity, NV sensors could, in principle, detect specific binding events with metabolites and proteins in a massively parallel and label-free way, avoiding the complexity of mass spectrometry. Realizing this vision has been hindered by the lack of quantum sensor arrays that unite high-density spatial multiplexing with uncompromising biochemical specificity. Here, we introduce a scalable quantum biosensing platform that overcomes these barriers by integrating the first multiplexed DNA microarray directly onto a subnanometer antifouling diamond surface. The 7x7 DNA array, patterned onto a diamond chip, enables simultaneous detection of 49 distinct biomolecular features with high spatial resolution and reproducibility, as verified by fluorescence microscopy. Molecular recognition is converted into a quantum signal via a target-induced displacement mechanism in which hybridization removes a Gd$^{3+}$-tagged DNA strand, restoring NV center spin relaxation times (T$_1$) and producing a binary quantum readout. This platform establishes a new paradigm for high-throughput, multiplexed quantum biosensing and opens the door to advanced molecular diagnostics and large-scale quantum sensor networks operable in complex biological environments.

    "abstract": "           Microresonator frequency combs offer tremendous opportunity to advance applications in fundamental research and technology by linking the optical and microwave frequency domains. Kerr-nonlinear microresonators further enable the generation of portable, integrated optical frequency combs, which are called microcombs. However, the dispersion engineering usually suffers from the small, geometric parameter space, and achieving soliton microcombs is challenging and usually requires complicated experimental techniques and setups. In recent years, the invention of photonic-crystal resonators (PhCRs) provides access to solitons in a convenient and stable way while its mechanism has not been fully understood. In this article, we highlight the perspectives of generating solitons for various applications in PhCRs and give a thorough understanding of the dynamics of soliton formation. We also propose a nanocomposite waveguide structure for the optimization of group velocity dispersion (GVD), lifting the limitation on geometric parameter space. We apply it to the design of the pump-harmonic microcomb, a new concept for f-2f self-referencing in microcombs. Inspired by the pulse-driven microresonator, we provide a scheme of two-microresonator network, retaining the convenience of using a continuous wave laser for microcomb generation. Our work depicts a blueprint of achieving the next generation soliton frequency combs in PhCR and nanocomposite microresonators and highlights their great prospects in optical metrology, precision measurement and optical data transmission.

    "abstract": "           Keyhole-induced (KH) porosity, which arises from unstable vapor cavity dynamics under excessive laser energy input, remains a significant challenge in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). This study presents an integrated experimental and data-driven framework using airborne acoustic emission (AE) to achieve high-resolution quantification of KH porosity. Experiments conducted on an LPBF system involved in situ acquisition of airborne AE and ex situ porosity imaging via X-ray computed tomography (XCT), synchronized spatiotemporally through photodiode signals with submillisecond precision. We introduce KHLineNum, a spatially resolved porosity metric defined as the number of KH pores per unit scan length, which serves as a physically meaningful indicator of the severity of KH porosity in geometries and scanning strategies. Using AE scalogram data and scan speed, we trained a lightweight convolutional neural network to predict KHLineNum with millisecond-scale temporal resolution, achieving an R-squared value exceeding 0.8. Subsequent analysis identified the 35-45 kHz frequency band of AE as particularly informative, consistent with known KH oscillations. Beyond defect quantification, the framework also enables AE-driven direct inference of KH regime boundaries on the power-velocity process map, offering a noninvasive and scalable component to labor-intensive post-process techniques such as XCT. We believe this framework advances AE-based monitoring in LPBF, providing a pathway toward improved quantifiable defect detection and process control.         ",

The device integrates monolithically fabricated silicon photodiodes enhanced with photon-trapping surface textures (PTST), enabling improved responsivity in the low-absorption NIR regime. Leveraging a fully connected neural network, we demonstrate accurate spectral reconstruction from only 16 uniquely engineered detectors, achieving <0.05 RMSE and 8nm resolution over a wide spectral range of 640nm to 1100nm. Our system outperforms conventional spectrometers, maintaining signal-to-noise ratio above 30dB even with 40dB of added detector noise; extending functionality to longer wavelengths up to 1100nm, while the traditional spectrometers fail to perform beyond 950nm due to poor detector efficiency and noise performance. With a footprint of 0.4mm2, dynamic range of 50dB, ultrafast time response (57ps), and high photodiode gain (>7000), this AI-augmented silicon spectrometer is well-suited for portable, real-time, and low-light applications in biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing.

Optical computing emerges as a promising paradigm to meet these challenges, whereas current optical computing architectures have limited versatility. Their applications are usually either constrained to a specialized domain or restricted to general-purpose matrix computation. Here, we implement a fully-programmable integrated photonic processor that can be configured to tackle both specific computational problems and general-purpose matrix computation. We achieve complete end-to-end control of the photonic processor by utilizing a self-developed integrated programmable optoelectronic computing platform. For domain-specific computing, our photonic processor can efficiently solve two kinds of NP-complete problems: subset sum problem (far more than 2^N different instances) and exact cover problem. For general-purpose computation, we experimentally demonstrate high-precision optical dot product and further realize accurate image edge detection and MNIST handwritten image classification task with an accuracy of 97%.

We perform a numerical bifurcation analysis of self-sustained pulse trains of a corresponding spin-flip model with delayed feedback. Its focus is on strongly resonant regimes, where the modulation of the peak intensities of polarized regenerative pulse trains locks to 2, 3 and 4 times the pulse regeneration time. Specifically, we identify points of strongly resonant rotation numbers on curves of torus bifurcations in the parameter plane of the amplitude and phase anisotropy parameters, and continue emerging curves of fold and period-doubling bifurcations to identify locking regions. In this way, we clarify where pulse trains show strongly resonant polarization dynamics and highlight that even weak polarization coupling in delay-coupled microlasers creates considerable dynamical richness. These results may have impact on the design of future coupled microlasers systems for neuroinspired on-chip computing, where the polarization of an excitable pulse can be used to encode or process information.

We uncover how material composition, geometry, and environmental design can dictate where information is generated and how it travels, in the same way as antennas and metasurfaces are used to sculpt electromagnetic energy. Plasmonic and dielectric resonances can enhance information flow, while gratings and near-field structures can reshape information radiation patterns.

    "abstract": "           This paper investigates a novel quasi-Minnaert resonance phenomenon in acoustic wave propagation through high-contrast medium in both two and three dimensions, occurring in the sub-wavelength regime. These media are characterized by physical properties significantly distinct from those of a homogeneous background. The quasi-Minnaert resonance is defined by two primary features: boundary localization, where the $L^2$-norms of the internal total field and the external scattered field exhibit pronounced concentration near the boundary, and surface resonance, marked by highly oscillatory behavior of the fields near the boundary. In contrast to classical Minnaert resonances, which are associated with a discrete spectral spectrum tied to physical parameters, quasi-Minnaert resonances exhibit analogous physical phenomena but with a continuous spectral spectrum. Using layer potential theory and rigorous asymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that the coupling between a high-contrast material structure, particularly with radial geometries, and a carefully designed incident wave is critical for inducing quasi-Minnaert resonances. Extensive numerical experiments, involving radial geometries (e.g., unit disks and spheres) and general-shaped geometries (e.g., hearts, Cassini ovals, and clovers in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and spheres in $\\mathbb{R}^3$), validate the occurrence of these resonances. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate that quasi-Minnaert resonances induce an invisibility cloaking effect in the high-contrast medium. These findings have significant implications for mathematical material science and the development of acoustic cloaking technologies.         ",

    "abstract": "           Photonic Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) is an established technique for measuring the velocities of fast-moving surfaces in high-energy-density experiments. In the standard approach to PDV analysis, a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to generate a spectrogram from which the velocity history of the target is inferred. The user chooses the form, duration and separation of the window function. Here we present a Bayesian approach to infer the velocity directly from the PDV oscilloscope trace, without using the spectrogram for analysis. This is clearly a difficult inference problem due to the highly-periodic nature of the data, but we find that with carefully chosen prior distributions for the model parameters we can accurately recover the injected velocity from synthetic data. We validate this method using PDV data collected at the STAR two-stage light gas gun at Sandia National Laboratories, recovering shock-front velocities in quartz that are consistent with those inferred using the STFT-based approach, and are interpolated across regions of low signal-to-noise data. Although this method does not rely on the same user choices as the STFT, we caution that it can be prone to misspecification if the chosen model is not sufficient to capture the velocity behavior. Analysis using posterior predictive checks can be used to establish if a better model is required, although more complex models come with additional computational cost, often taking more than several hours to converge when sampling the Bayesian posterior. We therefore recommend it be viewed as a complementary method to that of the STFT-based approach.         ",

By engineering the surface of silicon substrates, we aim to decrease the adhesion force between a metallic microparticle and the silicon surface. To this end, we investigate different methods of surface engineering that are based on chemical, physical, or physio-chemical modifications of the surface of silicon. We give quantitative results on the detachment force, finding a correlation between the water contact angle and the mean detachment force, indicating that hydrophobic surfaces are desired for low microparticle adhesion. We develop surface preparations decreasing the mean detachment force by more than a factor of three, or the force at which 50% of particles move by more than a factor of six, the compared to an untreated silicon surface. Our results will enable reliable levitation of microparticles and are relevant for experiments requiring low adhesion between microparticles and a surface.         ",

However, monitoring the fluorescence of individual defects within a sub-diffraction ensemble remains an outstanding challenge that currently limits access to atomic-scale features and dynamics. For compact clusters of NVs, imaging-based atomic sensing may be formulated as a low-dimensional multiparameter estimation task in which one seeks to localize each defect and quantify the field strength in its immediate vicinity. In this work, we employ optical spatial mode demultiplexing (SPADE) to enhance localization and brightness estimation accuracy at sub-diffraction scales. Specifically, we develop a two-stage sensing protocol that augments direct imaging by projecting the incoming optical field onto point spread function (PSF)-adapted spatial modes and Yuen-Kennedy-Lax (YKL) spatial modes, enabling efficient extraction of emitter positions and brightnesses. We numerically evaluate the statistical performance of our protocol for sub-diffraction optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and Rabi sensing experiments.

This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product.

It is a hard problem to solve using classical algorithms, as its complexity increases exponentially with problem size. Most quantum algorithms for solving IP are highly resource inefficient because they encode integers into qubits. In [1], the issue of resource inefficiency was addressed by mapping integer variables to qudits. However, [1] has limited practical value due to a lack of scalability to multiple qudits to encode larger problems. In this work, by extending upon the ideas of [1], a circuit-based scalable quantum algorithm is presented using multiple interacting qudits for which we show a quantum speed-up. The quantum algorithm consists of a distillation function that efficiently separates the feasible from the infeasible regions, a phase-amplitude encoding for the cost function, and a quantum phase estimation coupled with a multi-controlled single-qubit rotation for optimization. We prove that the optimal solution has the maximum probability of being measured in our algorithm. The time complexity for the quantum algorithm is shown to be $O(d^{n/2} + m\\cdot n^2\\cdot \\log{d} + n/\\epsilon_{QPE})$ for a problem with the number of variables $n$ taking $d$ integer values, satisfying $m$ constraints with a precision of $\\epsilon_{QPE}$.

Here, we vastly expand the nonlinear mode-locking toolbox into multi-timescale synchronization on a chip. We use topological photonics to engineer a 2D lattice of hundreds of coupled silicon nitride ring resonators capable of hosting nested mode-locked states with a fast (near 1 THz) single-ring and a slow (near 3 GHz) topological super-ring timescales. We demonstrate signatures of multi-timescale mode-locking including quadratic distribution of the pump noise with the two-time azimuthal mode dimensions, as expected by mode-locking theory. Our observations are further corroborated by direct signatures of the near-transform-limit repetition beats and the formation of the temporal pattern on the slow timescale. Moreover, we show that these exotic properties of edge-confined mode-locked states are in sharp contrast to bulk and single-ring counterparts and establish a clear pathway for their identification. Our unprecedented demonstration of mode-locking in topological combs unlocks the implementation of lattice-scale synchronization and independently tunable multi-timescale mode-locking phenomena, also the exploration of the fundamental nonlinearity-topology interplay on a chip.

    "title": "Towards Non-Invasive Sediment Monitoring Using Muography: A Pilot Run at the Shanghai Outer Ring Tunnel",
    "abstract": "           This study demonstrates the application of cosmic-ray muography as a non-invasive method for monitoring sediment accumulation and tidal influences in the Shanghai Outer Ring Tunnel, an immersed tube tunnel located beneath the Huangpu River in Shanghai, China. A portable, dual-layer plastic scintillator detector was deployed to conduct muon flux scans along the tunnel's length and to continuously monitor muon flux, allowing for the study of tidal effects. Geant4 simulations validated the correlation between muon attenuation and overburden thickness, incorporating sediment, water, and concrete layers. Key findings include a strong anti-correlation between the measured muon flux and the water levels observed at a nearby tide gauge. The results align with geotechnical data and simulations, especially in the region of interest, confirming muography's sensitivity to sediment dynamics. This work establishes muography as a robust tool for long-term, real-time monitoring of submerged infrastructure, offering significant advantages over conventional invasive techniques. The study underscores the potential for integrating muography into civil engineering practices to enhance safety and operational resilience in tidal environments.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present a SI-traceable temperature calibration apparatus utilizing optical lattice clocks for precision metrology. The system employs a dual-blackbody radiation shield chamber with independent temperature control, enabling synchronous differential measurements of blackbody radiation (BBR)-induced frequency shifts in atomic ensembles. By correlating these shifts with chamber temperature, we propose absolute temperature determination traceable to the SI second through the optical clock frequency. Comprehensive uncertainty analysis demonstrates an absolute temperature uncertainty below 17 mK across the $200 \\sim 350$ K range based on $^{87}$Sr optical lattice clock, representing an improvement of two orders of magnitude over current temperature measurements based on BBR-induced Rydberg state transitions. This advancement in primary thermometry offers significant improvements in precision, reproducibility, and versatility, with potential applications in metrology, fundamental physics, and industrial processes.

    "title": "Resonant theory of kinetic ballooning modes in general toroidal geometry",
    "abstract": "           The linear theory of the kinetic-ballooning-mode (KBM) instability is extended to capture a weakly-driven regime in general toroidal geometry where the destabilization is caused by the magnetic-drift resonance of the ions. Such resonantly-destabilized KBMs are characterized by broad eigenfunctions along the magnetic field line and near-marginal positive growth rates, even well below the beta threshold of their non-resonant counterparts. This unconventional (or sub-threshold) KBM, when destabilized, has been shown to catalyze an enhancement of turbulent transport in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator [1, 2]. Simplifying the energy dependence of key resonant quantities allows for an analytical treatment of this KBM using the physics-based ordering from the more general equations of Tang, Connor, and Hastie [3]. Results are then compared with high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations for the (st)KBM in W7-X and the conventional KBM in a circular tokamak at both high and low magnetic shear, where good agreement is obtained in all cases. This reduced KBM model provides deeper insight into (sub-threshold) KBMs and their relationship with geometry, and shows promise for aiding in transport model development and geometry-based turbulence optimization efforts going forward.

    "abstract": "           We develop an analytical model for calculation of optical spectra for metal nanostructures of arbitrary shape supporting localized surface plasmons (LSPs). For plasmonic systems with characteristic size below the diffraction limit, we obtain an explicit expression for optical polarizability that describes the lineshape of optical spectra solely in terms of the metal dielectric function and LSP frequency. The amplitude of the LSP spectral band is determined by the effective system volume that, for long-wavelength LSPs, can significantly exceed the physical volume of metal nanostructure. Within the quasistatic approach, we derive the exact LSP Green's function and establish general spectral properties of LSPs, including the distribution and oscillator strength of the LSP states. These results can be used to model or interpret the experimental spectra of plasmonic nanostructures and to tune their optical properties for various applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           In this work, we consider two-sender, one-receiver communication over a discrete memoryless multiple-access channel without feedback, where two senders may cooperate on channel coding by using pre-shared resources, such as shared randomness, quantum states and measurements, or nonlocal correlations. We present the capacity region when senders employ cooperative encoding with quantum and nonlocal resources, extending beyond shared randomness, and derive a sum rate that serves as a lower bound to the sum capacity, the lower bound is computable by exploiting specific strategies. We also compute the sum capacities for two instances. One is when senders apply local resources for cooperative encoding. The other is when senders exploit non-classical resources for encoding against channels constructed by referring to nonlocal games, in this way, correlated noise other than independent errors occurs on codewords. Comparing the exact sum capacities and lower bounds, we show that nonlocal and quantum resources for cooperative encoding enable higher sum capacities over local ones. The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and magic square games are considered for constructing multiple-access channels, and we demonstrate the usefulness of nonlocal and quantum resources to achieve higher sum capacities.

    "abstract": "           Non-Gaussian quantum states of mechanical motion exhibiting Wigner negativity offer promising capabilities for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states with such Wigner negativity is a highly sought goal but is challenging as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this form of interaction, by utilizing the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.
