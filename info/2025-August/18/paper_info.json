    "abstract": "           Optical interconnects are the most promising solution to address the data-movement bottleneck in data centers. Silicon microdisks, benefiting from their compact footprint, low energy consumption, and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) capability, have emerged as an attractive and scalable platform for optical modulation. However, microdisk resonators inherently exhibit low fabrication error tolerance, limiting their practical deployment. Here, utilizing a CMOS photonics platform, we demonstrate 1.2 Tb/s of off-die bandwidth through a 64 microdisk modulator system. In addition, we develop an automated, close-looped, non-reversible, low-loss, and picometer-precision permanent wavelength tuning technique using laser trimming. The trimming technique reduces 33 % of the energy consumption needed to thermally tune the microdisk resonant wavelength. Using this technique, we achieve a fully passive, 5-channel dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM, 50 GHz spacing) transmitter. The integration of the high speed (1.2 Tb/s), low energy consumption (29 fJ/bit) and the permanent wavelength trimming lays a robust foundation for next-generation optical interconnect systems, poised to facilitate scaling of future AI and computing hardware.

Here, we put forward a superponderomotive injection method of positrons in the blowout regime of laser wakefield acceleration. In this method, transverse laser fields facilitate the trapping of positrons into the laser-modulated longitudinal wakefield which dominates the subsequent energy gaining, that is distinct from the electrostatic induced superponderomotive electrons. Particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this method can be implemented by the collision between a donut wake and a pair jet, resulting in the multi-cycle positron beam with hundreds of pC charge and brightness of $10^{13}~\\rm{Am}^{-2}$. Such a collisional setup is available in the current laser-plasma experiments, and the generated positron beam is favorable for developing next generation of electron-positron collider, modeling the laboratory astrophysics and performing the ultrafast material diagnostics research.

However, the design and optimization of DFMI systems involve a complex interplay between interferometer physics, laser technology, multiple noise sources, and the choice of data processing algorithm. To address this, we present DeepFMKit, a new open-source Python library for the end-to-end simulation and analysis of DFMI systems. The framework features a high-fidelity physics engine that rigorously models key physical effects such as time-of-flight delays in dynamic interferometers, arbitrary laser modulation waveforms, and colored noise from user-defined $1/f^\\alpha$ spectral densities. This engine is coupled with a suite of interchangeable parameter estimation algorithms, including a highly-optimized, parallelized frequency-domain Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) for high-throughput offline analysis, and multiple time-domain Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) implementations for real-time state tracking, featuring both random walk and integrated random walk (constant velocity) process models. Furthermore, DeepFMKit includes a high-throughput experimentation framework for automating large-scale parameter sweeps and Monte Carlo analyses, enabling systematic characterization of system performance. DeepFMKit's modular, object-oriented architecture facilitates the rapid configuration of virtual experiments, providing a powerful computational tool for researchers to prototype designs, investigate systematic errors, and accelerate the development of precision interferometry.

Above-threshold ionization heating provides a robust mechanism for creating laser-matched plasma channels across a wide parameter range, owing to its density- and geometry-independent heating effect. Establishing predictive scaling laws between channel parameters and formation conditions is critical for designing channels optimized for electron acceleration across energies spanning hundreds of MeV to tens of GeV. Through combined timescale analysis and numerical simulations, hydrodynamic expansion is identified as the dominant mechanism governing density profile evolution during ATI channel formation. Remarkably, this process maintains effective laser-guiding channel structures across a wide range of initial gas density, as evidenced by the persistent profile similarity observed despite these significant parameter variations. For parabolic channels matched to Gaussian laser drivers, rigorous scaling laws are established that, the on-axis density scales linearly with the initial gas density, while the matching radius has an exponential dependence on both the initial gas density and the ionization laser radius. These findings provide a systematic framework for the predictive design and optimization of plasma channels in high-efficiency and high-energy LWFA applications.         ",

These optical resonances take the form of Fabry-Perot resonances in thick films and absorption resonances in ultrathin films placed on metallic substrates. Here, we investigate whether these optical resonances lead to true exciton-photon hybridization. Using far-field reflectance and spectrally resolved photocurrent measurements, we study tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) flakes on both metallic and dielectric substrates across a range of thicknesses. While reflectance spectra for ultrathin flakes exhibit resonance splitting between excitons and absorption resonances, our photocurrent measurements reveal only excitonic peaks, indicating that no polaritons are formed. In contrast, thicker flakes exhibit Fabry-Perot resonances that strongly couple to excitons, resulting in clear splitting in both reflectance and photocurrent spectra, and providing evidence of polariton formation. We further show that the polariton resonances can be tuned through the reflection phase at the WS$_2$-substrate interface by changing the substrate material. In addition to coupling with the strong A-exciton, we observe polariton formation involving the weaker B-exciton at shorter wavelengths, as well as higher-order hybridization where both excitons interact simultaneously with a single Fabry-Perot resonance. These findings clarify the distinction between apparent and true strong coupling in excitonic materials and demonstrate how reflection phase and flake thickness can be used to engineer light-matter interactions.

Using computational solutions of the relevant propagation equations, we study the effects of the ionizing pulse central wavelength in relation to the resonance frequencies of atomic rubidium. Recent experiments show that pulse propagation and plasma channel creation is distinctly different for 780 nm laser pulses (resonant with the rubidium $D_2$ line) and 810 nm laser pulses. We study pulse propagation in a $\\pm$30 nm range around the $D_2$ resonance and find that the results are distinctly different when tuning to sub-resonant wavelengths from those obtained for super-resonant wavelengths. For pulse wavelengths below the resonance the behavior is similar to the resonant case, characterized by strong self-focusing and a sharp plasma boundary. Pulse wavelengths above 780 nm on the other hand yield gradually weaker self-focusing and an increasingly diffuse plasma boundary. Our results suggest that the observed behavior can be attributed to an interplay between multiple factors: anomalous dispersion around atomic resonances, resonant transitions between excited states of Rb lying in the 740-780 nm range and wavelength-dependent multiphoton ionization rates.

    "abstract": "           We propose a universal physical mechanism for the emergence of 1/f fluctuations, observed across a wide range of systems. In particular, we verify this on acoustic cases. The mechanism is based on amplitude modulation (AM) and demodulation (DM), where the 1/f spectral law arises not in the raw waveform but in its demodulated amplitude envelope. Two distinct yet complementary processes generate the required AM: (i) stochastic synchronization among oscillators, modeled via an extended Kuramoto framework that captures perpetual synchronization-desynchronization cycles, and (ii) frequency-selective resonance, modeled by spectral accumulation of eigenmodes in acoustic or structural environments. Numerical simulations demonstrate that both mechanisms, acting separately or in combination, robustly produce 1/f spectra over several decades when DM is applied, and that the classical Kuramoto critical point is not necessary for their emergence. We demonstrate the cross-domain relevance of this AM/DM framework through analyses of musical performances, seismic records, and astrophysical time series, revealing a common underlying structure. This work establishes demodulation as a general route to 1/f fluctuations, providing a simple and scalable explanation for its ubiquity in both natural and engineered systems.

    "abstract": "           Controlling the optical properties of rare-earth ions in wide-bandgap semiconductors remains a major challenge in the development of next-generation photonic materials. Here, we show that external hydrostatic pressure modulates the structural characteristics of ZnO thin films and, in turn, tunes the optical emission behavior of embedded Eu3+ ions. By combining in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy under high-pressure conditions with first-principles calculations, we capture a pressure-induced phase transition from the hexagonal wurtzite to the cubic rocksalt structure near 10 GPa. This transformation is accompanied by complete quenching of the D0 - FJ Europium emissions near the transition threshold, followed by a partial recovery at higher pressures, likely associated with the emergence of structural disorder. Concurrently, the Stark components of the emission bands exhibit a redshift and significant broadening with increasing pressure, reflecting enhanced crystal field strength as interatomic distances decrease. Additional first-principles calculations support the observed pressure-induced shifts in the Eu-4f states and emphasize the influence of lattice symmetry on their electronic environment. These results show that hydrostatic pressure is an effective way to adjust the optical emissions of rare-earth ions by changing their symmetry and local environment, providing a basis for designing photonic devices and luminescent materials controlled by pressure.

    "abstract": "           Thermal light engineering is a field of considerable interest and potential. We study quantum light-matter interactions in a one-dimensional photonic crystal with two-level atoms as the active medium, replacing classical oscillators in traditional blackbody models. In a thermal bath with pumping, these atoms modulate thermal emission via interactions with photonic modes. The model with quantum two-level systems enables the processes of spontaneous emission, stimulated absorption, and stimulated emission. Equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes depend on competition between pumping and thermal relaxation rates. Strong light-matter interaction and photon decay govern dynamics and steady states. In equilibrium, with a high thermal relaxation rate, photon numbers are initially determined by spontaneous emission and later stabilize due to stimulated absorption, influenced by light-matter interaction strength. In-band-gap photons reach steady states at a time scale of one or two orders of magnitude longer than outside-band-gap photons. Interestingly, for a strong light-matter interaction, all photons in the equilibrium regimes show Planckian radiation, regardless of their frequencies in or out of the band gaps. Band-gap suppression of thermal emission is more pronounced with weaker light-matter interaction or larger photon decay. In the nonequilibrium regime, the dynamics of photon numbers exhibit a multi-time-scale process transitioning to steady states due to strong pumping and stimulated processes. Steady-state electron populations of two-level atoms deviate from the Fermi-Dirac distribution, and the steady-state photon numbers exhibit super-Planckian emission. These findings enable quantum control of thermal emission spectra, which is relevant for reducing thermal noise in quantum computing or enhancing radiative cooling.         ",

First, the transfer matrix of a single particle is computed via the extended boundary condition method, in which the electromagnetic fields both at fundamental frequency and SH are expanded in vector spherical wave functions, and the integral formulation is satisfied away from the surface of the scatterer. We allow for the accurate physical description of the SH sources by taking into account both local surface and nonlocal bulk polarization contributions to the nonlinear polarization density source responsible for the generation of the SH signal by a particle. This single-particle formalism is then extended to arbitrary distributions of particles by incorporating into the formalism linear and nonlinear electromagnetic wave scattering from the particles in the cluster. Importantly from a practical point of view, our method can be applied to particles of arbitrary shape made of optical materials characterized by general frequency-dispersion relations, so that it can describe the linear and nonlinear optical response of clusters of metallic, semiconductor, or polaritonic particles, as well as mixtures of such particles.

However, the highest sensitivity in this approach is typically achieved by introducing an additional microwave field acting as a local oscillator, thereby compromising the all-optical nature of the measurement. Here we propose an alternative method, optical-bias detection, that allows truly all-optical operation, while retaining exceptional sensitivity. We tackle the issue of laser phase noise, emerging in this type of detection, via a simultaneous measurement of the laser phase noise in a nonlinear process and real-time data processing, which overall yields an improvement of $35\\ \\mathrm{dB}$ in terms of signal-to-noise ratio compared with the basic approach.

    "abstract": "           Artificial neural networks have revolutionized fields from computer vision to natural language processing, yet their growing energy and computational demands threaten future progress. Optical neural networks promise greater speed, bandwidth, and energy efficiency, but suffer from weak optical nonlinearities. Here, we demonstrate a low-power, incoherent-light-driven optical extreme learner that leverages 'data nonlinearity' from optical pattern reverberation, eliminating reliance on intrinsic nonlinear materials. By encoding input data in the spatial polarization distribution of a tailored optical cavity and allowing light to pass through it multiple times, we achieve nonlinear transformations at extremely low optical power. Coupled with a simple trainable readout, our optical learner consistently outperforms linear digital networks in standard image classification tasks and XOR benchmarks, delivering accuracy matching fully nonlinear digital models. Our compact, energy-efficient approach significantly reduces complexity, cost, and energy consumption, paving the way for practical, scalable all-optical machine learning platforms.         ",

    "title": "Quantum Annealing for Enhanced Feature Selection in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Analysis",
    "abstract": "           Feature selection is a machine learning technique for identifying relevant variables in classification and regression models. In single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis, feature selection is used to identify relevant genes that are crucial for understanding cellular processes. Traditional feature selection methods often struggle with the complexity of scRNA-seq data and suffer from interpretation difficulties. Quantum annealing presents a promising alternative approach. In this study, we implement quantum annealing-empowered quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) for feature selection in scRNA-seq data. Using data from a human cell differentiation system and an anticancer drug resistance study, we demonstrate that QUBO feature selection effectively identifies genes whose expression patterns reflect critical cell state transitions associated with differentiation and drug resistance development. Our findings indicate that quantum annealing-powered QUBO reveals complex gene expression patterns potentially missed by traditional methods, thereby enhancing scRNA-seq data analysis and interpretation.
