    "abstract": "           Optical whispering gallery mode microcavity acoustic sensors have emerged significant potential in high-sensitivity acoustic signal detection, but the narrow dynamic range limits the application prospect. To address the challenge, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a high-sensitivity acoustic sensor in optical whispering gallery mode microcavity. The proposed sensor integrates an extended Mach-Zehnder polarization interferometer with postselection, extending the dynamic range to the free spectral range. The sensing regions can be categorized into phase-drastic and phase-enhanced regions, both of which yield an optimal acoustic response that surpasses traditional transmission method. Experiment results demonstrate improvements of 57.87 dB in detection sensitivity and 26 times in minimal detectable acoustic pressure over the transmission method. Moreover, the application of coherent state and heterodyne detection can enhance response amplitude, further improving the detection sensitivity. Given the wide application range for acoustic dispersion and dissipation response, as well as the performance advantages of high sensitivity and wide dynamic range, the proposed WGM sensor offers a promising solution for acoustic sensing. Potentially, the structural design may be adaptable to other application scenarios involving time-varying signals through optical microcavity sensing.         ",

    "abstract": "           The stability of optical solitons is a crucial factor in various applications. This work reveals a novel stable multipulse soliton attractor in fiber lasers. The attractor represents a bound state of multiple solitons, pulling other dynamical states toward itself. By introducing a polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF), the enhanced birefringence in the cavity induces the differential group delay (DGD) between the polarization components of the pulse, leading to soliton splitting and, ultimately, the formation of multi-soliton states. These multi-solitons, affected by intracavity nonlinear and dissipative effects, form attractors consisting of one to seven soliton pulses. Through a combination of experiments and numerical simulations, we systematically investigate the robustness and dynamical behavior of the multipulse soliton attractors. In this context, we analyze disturbances introduced by \"rogue\" solitons with different frequencies and conduct a comprehensive study of their interaction with the multipulse soliton attractors. The results show that the multipulse soliton attractors are structurally stable and highly resistant to external disturbances, highlighting their potential for high-precision fiber lasers and advanced multipulse systems.

We present a Model Context Protocol (MCP) assisted framework that allows researchers to conduct inverse design with differentiable solvers through large language models (LLMs). Since LLMs inherently lack knowledge of specialized solvers, our proposed solution provides dynamic access to verified code templates and comprehensive documentation through dedicated servers. The LLM autonomously accesses these resources to generate complete inverse design codes without prescribed coordination rules. Evaluation on the Huygens meta-atom design task with the differentiable TorchRDIT solver shows that while both natural language and structured prompting strategies achieve high success rates, structured prompting significantly outperforms in design quality, workflow efficiency, computational cost, and error reduction. The minimalist server design, using only 5 APIs, demonstrates how MCP makes sophisticated computational tools accessible to researchers without programming expertise, offering a generalizable integration solution for other scientific tasks.

    "abstract": "           Clock atom interferometry is an emerging technique in precision measurements that is particularly well suited for sensitivity enhancement through large momentum transfer (LMT). While current systems have demonstrated momentum separations of several hundreds of photon momenta, next-generation quantum sensors are targeting an LMT enhancement factor beyond $10^4$. However, the viability of LMT clock interferometers has recently come into question due to the potential impact of laser frequency noise. Here, we resolve this concern by analyzing the cumulative fidelity of sequential state inversions in an LMT atom interferometer. We show that the population error from $n$ pulses applied from alternating directions scales linearly with $n$. This is a significant advantage over the $n^2$ scaling that occurs when probing a two-level system $n$ times from the same direction. We further show that contributions to the interferometer signal from parasitic paths generated by imperfect pulses are negligible, for any loss mechanism. These results establish that laser frequency noise is not a practical limitation for the development of high-fidelity LMT clock atom interferometers.         ",

Observations from our simulations indicate that the cavity design is able to operate within a range of microwave power and gas pressure upto $P_{in}=6$ kW and $p_{0}=30$ kPa respectively.

We show how ionization rates oscillate with oscillations of envelope reflecting modulation of the population of the excited molecular orbital. We observe the increase in ionization due to mechanisms analogous to Charge Resonance Enhanced Ionization (CREI) and also uncover also the time periods of suppressed ionization. Electronic flux calculations illustrate these changes and help reveal multiple ionization bursts which are for the first time reported for a multielectron non-stretched/ non-dissociating molecule. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of ultrafast intense laser pulses on the bonding properties of a nitrogen molecular ion in these conditions through detailed analysis of electron density and electron density differences, time-dependent average local energy, and time-dependent electron localization function. We illustrate the main characteristics of changes of the electron density that leads to laser induced dynamics of bonding and how the standard criteria lead to the transient properties of double, triple, and lone pair bonding characteristics.

This paper proposes a physics-informed deep contrast source inversion framework (DeepCSI) for fast and accurate medium reconstruction across various measurement conditions. Inspired by contrast source inversion (CSI) and neural operator methods, a residual multilayer perceptron (ResMLP) is employed to model current distributions in the region of interest under different transmitter excitations, effectively linearizing the nonlinear inverse scattering problem and significantly reducing the computational cost of traditional full-waveform inversion. By modeling medium parameters as learnable tensors and utilizing a hybrid loss function that integrates state equation loss, data equation loss, and total variation regularization, DeepCSI establishes a fully differentiable framework for joint optimization of network parameters and medium properties. Compared with conventional methods, DeepCSI offers advantages in terms of simplicity and universal modeling capabilities for diverse measurement scenarios, including phase-less and multi-frequency observation. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that DeepCSI achieves high-precision, robust reconstruction under full-data, phaseless data, and multifrequency conditions, outperforming traditional CSI methods and providing an efficient and universal solution for complex inverse scattering problems.

    "abstract": "           Heating and ionization are among the most fundamental processes in ultra-short, relativistic laser-solid interactions. However, capturing their spatiotemporal evolution experimentally is challenging due to the inherently transient and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) nature. Here, time-resolved resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy, in conjunction with simultaneous X-ray absorption imaging, is employed to investigate such complex dynamics in a thin copper wire driven by an optical high-intensity laser pulse, with sub-picosecond temporal resolution. The diagnostic leverages the high brightness and narrow spectral bandwidth of an X-ray free-electron laser, to selectively excite resonant transitions of highly charged ions within the hot dense plasma generated by the optical laser. The measurements reveal a distinct rise-and-fall temporal evolution of the resonant X-ray emission yield-and consequently the selected ion population-over a 10 ps timescale, accompanied by an inversely correlated x-ray transmission. In addition, off-resonance emissions with comparable yields on both sides of the XFEL photon energy are clearly observed, indicating balanced ionization and recombination rates. Furthermore, experimental results are compared with comprehensive simulations using atomic collisional-radiative models, PIC, and MHD codes to elucidate the underlying physics. The comparison reveals that typical models overestimate the plasma heating under the extreme conditions achieved in our experiment, highlighting the requirement for improved modeling of NLTE collisional processes for predictive capabilities. These results are of broad interest to the high-energy-density science and inertial fusion energy research, both as an experimental platform for accessing theoretically challenging conditions and as a benchmark for improving models of high-power laser-plasma interactions.

    "abstract": "           The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems. In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks. Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.

Particular emphasis is placed on phased-array transmitter systems, whose large effective apertures significantly reduce beam divergence relative to single-aperture designs, resulting in orders-of-magnitude increases in delivered surface power under equivalent orbital and power conditions. Parametric sensitivity analyses and illustrative numerical simulations demonstrate how phased-array architectures improve power density and end-to-end efficiency at operational lunar distances. The study also examines advanced orbital configurations (e.g., Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits, Earth-Moon Lagrange points), real-time adaptive beam steering and wavefront control, optimized receiver geometries, and thermal/dust mitigation strategies. The results establish a clear pathway toward scalable, efficient laser power beaming infrastructures capable of overcoming lunar-specific challenges - including prolonged darkness and permanently shadowed regions - and enabling sustained robotic and crewed surface operations.

    "abstract": "           Cytoskeletal filaments transported by surface immobilized molecular motors with one end pinned to the surface have been observed to spiral in a myosin-driven actin 'gliding assay'. The radius of the spiral was shown to scale with motor density with an exponent of -1/3, while the frequency was theoretically predicted to scale with an exponent of 4/3. While both the spiraling radius and frequency depend on motor density, the theory assumed independence of filament length, and remained to be tested on cytoskeletal systems other than actin-myosin. Here, we reconstitute dynein-driven microtubule spiraling and compare experiments to theory and numerical simulations. We characterize the scaling laws of spiraling MTs and find the radius dependence on force density to be consistent with previous results. Frequency on the other hand scales with force density with an exponent of ~1/3, contrary to previous predictions. We also predict that the spiral radius scales proportionally and the frequency scales inversely with filament length, both with an exponent of ~1/3. A model of variable persistence length best explains the length dependence observed in experiments. Our findings that reconcile theory, simulations, and experiments improve our understanding of the role of cytoskeletal filament elasticity, mechanics of microtubule buckling and motor transport and the physical principles of active filaments.

    "abstract": "           State-of-the-art free-space continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols use phase reference pulses to modulate the wavefront of a real local oscillator at the receiver, thereby compensating for wavefront distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence. It is normally assumed that the wavefront distortion in these phase reference pulses is identical to the wavefront distortion in the quantum signals, which are multiplexed during transmission. However, in many real-world deployments, there can exist a relative wavefront error (WFE) between the reference pulses and quantum signals, which, among other deleterious effects, can severely limit secure key transfer in satellite-to-Earth CV-QKD. In this work, we introduce novel machine learning-based wavefront correction algorithms, which utilize multi-plane light conversion for decomposition of the reference pulses and quantum signals into the Hermite-Gaussian (HG) basis, then estimate the difference in HG mode phase measurements, effectively eliminating this problem. Through detailed simulations of the Earth-satellite channel, we demonstrate that our new algorithm can rapidly identify and compensate for any relative WFEs that may exist, whilst causing no harm when WFEs are similar across both the reference pulses and quantum signals. We quantify the gains available in our algorithm in terms of the CV-QKD secure key rate. We show channels where positive secure key rates are obtained using our algorithms, while information loss without wavefront correction would result in null key rates.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present a quantum computing simulation study of mass-dependent decoherence models inspired by Penrose's gravity-induced collapse hypothesis. According to objective reduction (OR) theory, quantum superpositions become unstable when the gravitational self-energy difference between branches exceeds a certain threshold, leading to a collapse time $\\tau \\approx \\hbar / E_G$. In this work, we implement a mass-dependent dephasing noise channel, $p(m) = 1 - e^{-k m^{\\alpha}}$, within the Qiskit AerSimulator, where $m$ is a proxy for the effective mass of a superposition, mapped to circuit parameters such as the number of entangled qubits or branch size. We apply this model to three canonical quantum computing experiments: GHZ state parity measurements, branch-mass entanglement tests, and Grover's search to generate distinctive collapse signatures that differ qualitatively from constant-rate dephasing. The resulting patterns serve as a baseline reference: if future hardware experiments exhibit the same scaling trends under ideal isolation, this could indicate a contribution from mass-dependent collapse processes. Conversely, deviation toward constant-noise behaviour would suggest the absence of such gravitationally induced effects. Our results provide a reproducible protocol and reference for using quantum computers as potential testbeds for probing fundamental questions in quantum mechanics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.         ",

This work, for the first time, presents a systematic experimental comparison of lateral and vertical beta-Ga2O3 PCSS under both intrinsic (245 nm) and extrinsic (280 nm, 300 nm, and 445 nm) optical excitation. Under intrinsic excitation, where carrier generation is confined near the surface due to the shallow absorption depth (approximately between 0.1 and 1 um), the lateral PCSS demonstrated higher photocurrent performance compared to the vertical structure. In contrast, under extrinsic excitation, which enables deeper penetration into the bulk, the vertical PCSS exhibited enhanced switching performance due to a more uniform electric-field distribution across the device volume. These results highlight the critical role of device geometry and carrier generation mechanism in optimizing Ga2O3 PCSS performance and provide valuable guidance for developing efficient and cost-effective high-voltage PCSSs.

    "abstract": "           Reconstructing the density matrix of the quantum state of photons through a tomographically complete set of measurements, known as quantum state tomography, is an essential task in nearly all applications of quantum science and technology, from quantum sensing to quantum communications. Recent advances in optical metasurfaces enable the design of ultra-thin nanostructured optical elements performing such state tomography tasks, promising greater simplicity, miniaturization, and scalability. However, reported metasurfaces on this goal were limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial qudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit tomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural question arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is sufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In this work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical experiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over 11,000 distinct metasurfaces each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size. We show that with sufficient redundancy in the number of detectors, random metasurfaces perform reasonably well in quantum photonic spatial qudit tomography encoded in Hermite-Gaussian states for up to approximately 10 states. Furthermore, we discuss additional considerations for optimizing metasurfaces in multi-photon cases. Our work opens a pathway toward computationally efficient, miniaturized, and error-tolerant quantum measurement platforms.         ",
