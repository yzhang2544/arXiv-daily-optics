    "abstract": "           We read Karen Crowther's \\emph{Another 100 Years of Quantum Interpretation?} with two practical goals. First, we spell out what she means by interpretation'': an attempt to provide understanding (not just predictions), which may be representationalist or non-representationalist, and which she contrasts with deeper \\emph{reductive} (inter-theoretic) explanation -- especially in the quantum-gravity setting. Second, we list twelve points where the paper's physics-facing wording could be sharpened. In our view, several claims are directionally well-motivated but stated more strongly than the underlying physics supports, or they run together distinct notions (e.g.\\ degrees of freedom,'' singularity,'' and different senses of locality'') that need careful separation. We end by suggesting that the philosophical question is genuinely worthwhile, but the physics should be phrased more cautiously so that heuristic motivation is not mistaken for strict implication.

    "abstract": "           The development of wearable devices for terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is pivotal for forthcoming 6G Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable optoelectronics. However, existing THz system suffers from bulkiness, narrow spectral response and limited flexibility constrained by their dependence on external antennas, complex coupling architectures and rigid components. Here, we present a 2D THz smart wristband based on a graphene plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC) array, which integrates sensing and communication within a monolithic microdetector. Operating without any external antenna, the compact and flexible device enables self-powered, polarization-sensitive and frequency-selective THz detection across a broad response spectrum from 0.25 to 4.24 THz, with a responsivity of 6 V/W, a response time of 62 ms, and mechanical robustness maintained over 2000 bending cycles. Notably, we further exploit its multi-parameter THz responses for dual-purpose ISAC functionality. For sensing, the polarization- and strain-dependent THz responses are utilized as high-dimensional features for a convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling circuit fault diagnosis with 97% accuracy. For communication, the device implements secure encrypted communication under simulated on-body wearing condition through dual-channel encoding of THz polarization and on-off signals. This 2D ISAC platform paves the way for miniaturized, intelligent wearable systems for advanced human-machine interaction.         ",

In this work, we demonstrate that device specific spectral complexity can be achieved using completely standardized photonic building blocks. Using a waveguide Mach-Zehnder interferometer internally loaded with two sets of non-concentric dual ring resonators, we demonstrate the generation of unclonable keys for one-time pad encryption which can be reconfigured on the fly by applying small voltages to on-chip thermo-optic elements. With this method, we access a keyspace larger than 12 Tb for a single device with simple, single-mode waveguide input and output coupling. Using two devices at either end of a communication channel, we show that an eavesdropper tapping the channel fibre link would be unable to recover the same spectrum measured at either end of the link, providing physical encryption for key distribution. Furthermore, being purely classical, this form of secure communications does not require quantum photonic sources or detectors, and can therefore be easily integrated into pre-existing telecommunication architectures.

We present a detailed study of the leakage channels, including higher vibrational and rotational states. By combining microwave remixing with optical pumping of rotational and vibrational dark states, we reduced the total leakage fraction to 10^-5. Using frequency-chirped laser slowing, we slowed a subset of buffer-gas-cooled BaF molecules from approximately 80 m/s to near-zero velocity, which is critical for efficient MOT loading.

We present an unsupervised, reconstruction-based anomaly-detection strategy for fast Region-of-Interest (ROI) extraction that operates directly on minimally processed camera frames. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images learns the detector noise morphology without labels, simulation, or fine-grained calibration. Applied to standard data-taking frames, localized reconstruction residuals identify particle-induced structures, from which compact ROIs are extracted via thresholding and spatial clustering. Using real data from the CYGNO optical TPC prototype, we compare two pedestal-trained autoencoder configurations that differ only in their training objective, enabling a controlled study of its impact. The best configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with an inference time of approximately 25 ms per frame on a consumer GPU. The results demonstrate that careful design of the training objective is critical for effective reconstruction-based anomaly detection and that pedestal-trained autoencoders provide a transparent and detector-agnostic baseline for online data reduction in optical TPCs.

    "abstract": "           By injecting configurational entropy into soft ionic lattices, high-entropy halide perovskites offer a compelling route toward photonic materials that are both functionally rich and operationally robust; however, converting compositional complexity into predictable optical function remains challenging. Here we demonstrate device-relevant ultrabroadband near-infrared (NIR) photonics by integrating element-specific roles within an entropy-stabilized lattice. We establish high-entropy rare-earth halide double-perovskite single crystals, Cs2Na(Sb,Re)Cl6 (Re3+ = Sc3+, Er3+, Yb3+, Tm3+), where near-equiatomic B(III)-site alloying yields a single-phase cubic solid solution (S_config about 1.6R) with homogeneous multication incorporation. Sb3+ acts as a broadband sensitizer that unifies excitation and cooperatively activates multiple lanthanide emitters, transforming single-mode emission into wide-coverage NIR output (850-1600 nm) with three fingerprint bands at 996, 1220, and 1540 nm. This tri-peak, self-referenced signature enables redundancy-based ratiometric readout with reduced sensitivity to intensity drift, supporting reliable solvent identification and quantitative mixture sensing. Beyond functional expansion, accelerated aging tests show markedly improved tolerance to humidity and oxygen versus single-component analogues. The robustness is experimentally attributed to octahedral contraction-strengthened metal-halide bonding that increases the kinetic barrier for moisture-triggered bond cleavage, together with entropy-induced lattice distortion that impedes long-range halide migration and suppresses defect/impurity-phase formation. Finally, a UV-pumped phosphor-converted LED delivers spectrally stable, wide-coverage NIR illumination, highlighting configurational-entropy engineering as a practical strategy to couple ultrabroadband photonic function with environmental stability.

Starting from a symmetric honeycomb photonic crystal that attains Dirac points at the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, $K$ and $K'$, we introduce two classes of perturbations for the periodic medium. The perturbations lift the Dirac degeneracy, forming a spectral band valley at the points $K$ and $K'$ with well-defined topological phase that depends on the sign of the perturbation parameters. By employing the layer potential techniques and spectral analysis, we investigate the existence of guided wave along an interface when two honeycomb photonic crystals are glued together.

Azopolymers provide an alternative route by converting structured optical fields into surface reliefs via light-induced mass migration, but existing approaches have been limited to smooth, shallow, and engraving-like topographies produced from a flat film. Here we introduce an all-optical, maskless, fully digital lithography platform that exploits engineered darkness within computer-generated holograms to spatially localize inward mass transport and directly produce positive, protruding microreliefs. We show that isolated and array of micro-bumps can be generated from pristine flat azopolymer films in a single writing step, and we introduce spatiotemporal control through sequential tailored illumination to reshape microrelief profiles, enabling flattened-top micropillars, programmable array shapes and arrangements, and free-form continuous microrelief designs. Hierarchical microarchitectures are also demonstrated by extending the concept of multi-step illumination sequences. As functional demonstrations, we realize multi-focus microlenses and quasi-square diffraction gratings with enhanced 1st-order efficiencies. Finally, we leverage azopolymer reconfigurability to implement write-erase-rewrite cycles that reset and repurpose the same surface region for distinct micropatterns, enabling rewritable surfaces and reprogrammable master templates for replication. Overall, this work establishes a scalable spatiotemporal strategy for on-demand, all-optical microfabrication and reprogramming of structured surfaces, where spatial and temporal degrees of freedom of holographic patterns intermix to produce advanced patterning capabilities.

Our system substantially enhances the secure key rate, enabling high-resolution video calls with one-time-pad encryption over intercity backbone QKD links. This work represents a significant step forward in the development of high-performance practical QKD systems.         ",

Two alternative methods have been implemented, based on the use of either spiral zone plates or fork gratings devices, and we show how they can be used for both defining and assessing the orbital angular momentum of an x-ray beam. We show also how multiple devices can be used in sequence to define an integer arithmetic of the orbital angular momentum of the final x-ray beam. Finally, we report the results of the first resonant scattering pilot experiments in transmission and reflection mode, intended to assess the feasibility of future users measurements.

By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity. Furthermore, as a generative model, AODDiff inherently enables uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling, offering critical confidence metrics for downstream applications.         ",

The Uhlmann geometric phase offers a natural extension of pure-state paradigms and can exhibit a topological character. However, observation of this invariant is impeded by the incompatibility between Uhlmann parallel transport and Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as the difficulty of preparing topologically nontrivial mixed states. To address this challenge, we report an experimentally accessible protocol for directly measuring the mixed-state topological invariant. By engineering controlled nonunitary dynamics in a photonic quantum walk, we prepare topologically nontrivial mixed states from a trivial initial state. Furthermore, by machine-learning the full density matrix in momentum space, we directly extract the quantized geometric phase of the nontrivial mixed states. These results highlight a geometric phase framework that naturally extends to open quantum systems both in and out of thermal equilibrium.         ",

    "abstract": "           Technologies for manipulating single atoms have advanced drastically in the past decades. Due to their excellent controllability of internal states, atoms serve as one of the ideal platforms as quantum systems. One major research direction in atomic systems is the precise determination of physical quantities using atoms, which is included in the field of precision measurements. One of such precisely measured physical quantities is energy differences between two energy levels in atoms, which is symbolized by the remarkable fractional uncertainty of $10^{-18}$ or lower achieved in the state-of-the-art atomic clocks. Two-level systems in atoms are sensitive to various external fields and can, therefore, function as quantum sensors. The effect of these fields manifests as energy shifts in the two-level system. Traditionally, such shifts are induced by electric or magnetic fields, as recognized even before the advent of precision spectroscopy with lasers. With high-precision measurements, tiny energy shifts caused by hypothetical fields weakly coupled to ordinary matter or by small effects mediated by massive particles can be potentially detectable, which are conventionally dealt with in the field of nuclear and particle physics. In most cases, the atomic systems as quantum sensors have not been sensitive enough to detect such effects. Instead, experiments searching for these interactions have placed constraints on coupling constants, except in a few cases where effects are predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. Nonetheless, measurements and searches for these effects in atomic systems have led to the emergence of a new field of physics.         ",

The variational form of RSE, providing a practical tool for calculating energy levels and wave functions, is also derived. The resulting angular integrals were derived by expanding bipolar harmonics in a basis of parity-adapted Wigner functions. The theoretical results are numerically validated by computing accurate energy levels for selected states of the helium atom in the explicitly correlated Hylleraas-type basis. The work aims to serve as a self-contained reference for the previously scattered throughout the scientific literature formulation of RSE, offering a convenient foundation for further analytical studies of three-particle quantum systems with arbitrary angular momentum and parity.

We investigate a subset of the available filter functions, demonstrating that a N = 4 input triangular mesh with M = 3 layers may be operated via self-configuration algorithms to filter M arbitrary wavelengths from a given input spectrum. The tunable nature of the architecture enables preconfigured filter functions to be swept in the spectral domain continuously over the free spectral range of the device. This removes any strict requirements between the design parameters of the architecture and the center wavelength of a desired filter function. With this architecture, we experimentally demonstrate arbitrary wavelength rejection filters with contrasts as deep as 40 dB. Further, by intentionally selecting the center wavelengths of each filter function to lie along a wavelength grid we demonstrate deep wavelength division demultiplexing (DWDM) with inter-channel crosstalk between -25 dB and -40 dB. Unlike typical DWDM systems, in this architecture the center wavelength of each channel is not fixed at fabrication and instead may be swept or reordered arbitrarily. This device demonstrates advantages over typical methods for DWDM, Raman spectroscopy, and correlation spectroscopy as well as other applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           Analog bolometers based on temperature-dependent phase-transition materials such as vanadium oxide (VOx) and barium titanate (BTO) represent the state of the art in uncooled infrared detectors. Recently, the first room-temperature spintronic Poisson bolometer based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) was proposed and demonstrated as a promising infrared detector. Unlike conventional bolometers, the spintronic Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, where the response is governed by resistance fluctuations arising from thermally activated magnetization transitions. Spontaneous transitions between two metastable magnetic states occur even in the absence of incident light, and the transition probability increases under illumination. In this work, we experimentally study the statistical properties of the optical response of the spintronic Poisson bolometer under illumination. We demonstrate that transitions in spintronic Poisson bolometers, both in the absence and presence of light, exhibit Poissonian behavior, with transition rates and interarrival times modulated by incident radiation. Under illumination, we observe a 153% increase in the count rate accompanied by a 70% reduction in interarrival time. These results establish spintronic Poisson bolometers as a promising platform for probabilistic, high-speed, and high-sensitivity infrared detection at room temperature.         ",

Thus, PQME serves as an efficient method to describe charge and exciton transfer/transport dynamics for a broad range of parameters in condensed or complex environments. However, in some cases, the polaron transformation (PT) being employed in the formulation invokes an over-relaxation of slow modes and results in premature suppression of important coherence terms. A formal framework to address this issue is developed in the present work by employing a partial PT that has smaller weights for low frequency bath modes. It is shown here that a closed form expression of a 2nd order time-local PQME including all the inhomogeneous terms can be derived for a general form of partial PT, although more complicated than that for the full PT. All the expressions needed for numerical calculation are derived in detail. Applications to a model of two-level system coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators, with test calculations focused on those due to homogeneous relaxation terms, demonstrate the feasibility and the utility of the present approach.

In 2015, Mundarain and Ladr\u00f3n de Guevara [Quantum Inf. Process. 14, 4493 (2015)] introduced local-available quantum correlations (LAQC), which are a promising yet understudied quantum correlation. Recently, Bellorin et al. [Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 36, 22500990 (2022), Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 36, 2250154 (2022)] obtained exact analytical results for the LAQC quantifier of general 2-qubit X states. Building up from those results, we analyzed the LAQC swapping for 2-qubit X states. As expected, we find that if the initial states are non-classical and the one used for the projective measurement is entangled, the final state will generally have non-zero LAQC. Using the properties of this quantum correlation, we establish the conditions for a QCS scheme that leads to a final state with a non-zero LAQC measure. We illustrate these results by analyzing five families of one-parameter 2-qubit X states, including families where the projective measure leads to a separable state, but whose LAQC measure is non-zero. This feature opens the possibility for this quantum correlation to be considered a genuine resource in quantum information technology.         ",
