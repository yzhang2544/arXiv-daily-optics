    "abstract": "           Progress towards quantum utility in chemistry requires not only algorithmic advances, but also the identification of chemically meaningful problems whose electronic structure fundamentally challenges classical methods. Here, we introduce a curated hierarchy of chemically decisive benchmark systems designed to probe distinct regimes of electronic correlation relevant to molecular, bioinorganic, and heavy-element chemistry. Moving beyond minimal toy models, our benchmark set spans multireference bond breaking (N$_2$), high-spin transition-metal chemistry (FeS), biologically relevant iron-sulfur clusters ([2Fe-2S]), and actinide-actinide bonding (U$_2$), which exhibits extreme sensitivity to active-space choice, relativistic treatment, and correlation hierarchy even within advanced multireference frameworks. As a concrete realization, we benchmark a recently developed automated and adaptive quantum algorithm based on generator-coordinate-inspired subspace expansion,ADAPT-GCIM, using a black-box workflow that integrates entropy-based active-space selection via the ActiveSpaceFinder tool. Across this chemically diverse problem set, ADAPT-GCIM achieves high accuracy in challenging correlation regimes. Equally importantly, these benchmarks expose general failure modes and design constraints-independent of any specific algorithm-highlighting the necessity of problem-aware and correlation-specific strategies for treating strongly correlated chemistry on quantum computers. To support systematic benchmarking and reproducible comparisons, the Hamiltonians for all systems studied are made openly available.         ",

    "abstract": "           We study light propagation in a medium with uniform torsion, modeled as a continuum of screw dislocations within the geometric theory of defects. By solving Maxwell's equations in covariant form, we show that torsion induces intrinsic chirality and circular birefringence: right- and left-circular polarizations acquire different wavenumbers, leading to a purely geometric optical activity. The polarization plane of a linearly polarized beam rotates according to the simple law $\\Delta\\theta = \\Omega\\rho L$, linear in the dislocation density $\\Omega$, propagation length $L$, and transverse coordinate $\\rho$. This can be recast as an effective birefringence $\\Delta n = 2c\\Omega\\rho/\\omega$, providing geometric design rules for torsion-induced rotatory power. Using parameters from dislocated semiconductors, we obtain millidegree rotations over millimetre-scale paths, within reach of modern polarimetric techniques and amenable to enhancement in metamaterial platforms. We also show that the same spiral geometry implements a broadband geometric phase gate for polarization qubits and has an electronic analogue on the surface of cylindrical topological insulators, where torsion shears the Dirac cone, establishing a unified geometric link between torsion, optical activity, and topological electronic responses.

    "abstract": "           Sea ice mechanical properties are involved in dynamical processes acting from the scale of meters to several hundred kilometers. The current rapid changes in the state of polar sea ice require a better understanding and modeling of these processes and, therefore, accurate measurements of properties including sea ice thickness, density, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. These properties can be measured by tracking the propagation of elastic waves within the ice. Recent technological advances have enabled the use of fiber-optic cables as cost-effective, dense seismic arrays. Once connected to an interrogator unit and mechanically coupled to a medium, here the ice cover, these cables can monitor strain field propagation, using a technique called Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). In this work, we describe the use of such an array of sensors in the coastal ice of the St. Lawrence Estuary, Canada, where a 600 m long optical fiber was deployed across three different morphological sea ice conditions. During hour-long recordings, we measured the propagation of both multi-modal seismic signals generated by active sources and hydro-elastic swell. We computed dispersion curves of active signals and used Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to observe the evolution of swell characteristics in the different ice areas. The dispersion curves were successfully inverted to measure the spatial evolution of ice thickness, and Young's and flexural rigidity in each of these areas. We observed ice thicknesses from 25 cm to 68 cm and Young's modulus values between 4.5 GPa and 5.7 GPa, in good agreement with values derived from collocated geophone arrays and drill hole thickness measurements. DAS systems therefore appear to be effective in evaluating heterogeneous sea ice mechanical properties and thus sea ice formation history and dynamics.         ",

Building on but going beyond the scope of Ref.~\\cite{single_cycle_nlty_Letter}, we focus on dynamical features previously unexplored. Our formulation reveals clear signatures of quantum coherence in the net absorption dynamics and highlights the emergence of strong excited-state absorption under intense excitation. It also clarifies that spontaneous emission can be neglected in this regime. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of pump pulse intensity on the local field's duration, spectral broadening and shift, and phase induced by carrier dynamics, highlighting the absorptive nature of the nonlinear response. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding nonlinear light-matter interaction in dispersive, low-density electron systems driven far from equilibrium by intense broadband excitation.

    "abstract": "           The need for semiconductor technology for crystalline silicon of the highest purity and homogeneity has provided samples exhibiting low optical absorption in the infrared range. Such silicon has become the basis for photonic elements in the telecommunication band, including high-Q microresonators, which are particularly important. However, at longer wavelengths, the loss mechanisms have not yet been sufficiently studied. At the same time, this range is extremely important, especially for biological and medical applications and for fundamental research. We used optical microresonators with whispering gallery modes made from various types of silicon crystals as a tool to study the loss mechanisms. The study involved the pump wavelengths 1.5, 2.6, 6.1, and 8.6 $\\mu$m and the maximum measured Q-factors were $1.5\\cdot10^9$, $5\\cdot10^8$, $1.6\\cdot10^7$, and $5\\cdot10^4$, respectively. We showed that the conductivity type does not noticeably influence the optical losses, while resistivity and the growing method are defining factors. Our study confirms the utility of WGM microresonators as loss measurement tools and provides significant potential for the development of silicon microresonator-based photonics in the mid-IR band.

    "abstract": "           Earthquake-induced landslides are among the most destructive cascading hazards, yet the physical mechanisms governing their spatial distribution and size remain incompletely understood. While amplification of seismic waves by local topography is well documented, the role of mountain-scale resonance has remained largely untested. Here we demonstrate that the resonant frequency of mountains exerts a statistically significant control on the occurrence, spatial pattern, and size of coseismic landslides. Using the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, which triggered more than 25,000 landslides, we combine three-dimensional modal analysis of 3,130 mountain bodies with a high-resolution landslide inventory. Landslides preferentially occur on mountains whose resonant frequencies (0.5-1.2 Hz) overlap with the dominant frequency content of the earthquake. Mountains affected by landslides exhibit systematically lower resonant frequencies than stable mountains, and larger landslides are associated with lower-frequency mountains. These findings provide quantitative evidence that mountain-scale resonance amplifies seismic ground motion sufficiently to influence landslide triggering, highlighting an overlooked mechanism that should be incorporated into assessments of earthquake-induced landslide hazard.

    "abstract": "           Self-propelled phoretic swimmers are generally studied in the laminar flow regime, where their low speed renders inertial effects negligible and trajectories highly predictable. This research tackles the challenge of propulsion in the inertial regime, at moderate Reynolds numbers (100 < Re < 200), where fluid dynamics becomes non-linear. By using a chemically driven macroscopic hydrogel this work demonstrates, through experiments and modeling, the existence of stable resonant states under confined geometry: as the swimmer circles, it interacts with its own lasting chemical wake. This chemical self-feedback creates a complex, stable motion characterized by both universal exponential speed decay with superimposed significant periodic speed oscillations. Furthermore, a critical threshold speed is identified, where the system abruptly transitions from the resonant oscillatory regime to a stochastic stop & go behavior. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how chemical fields, hydrodynamic inertia, and confinement couple to determine the motion properties of high-speed active matter.         ",

    "abstract": "           Decarbonization is rapidly increasing the penetration of inverter-based renewables and other low-capacity generators, intensifying concerns about frequency synchronization in increasingly decentralized power grids. A common heuristic from Kuramoto onset theory and homogeneous parameter swing-equation models is that distributing generation across many smaller units reduces the effective heterogeneity of nodal injections (natural frequencies) and lowers the coupling required for synchronization. Here, using a second-order Kuramoto model, we investigate how decentralization affects frequency synchronization when inertia and damping scale with power generation and consumption. We find that decentralization does not always lower the critical frequency synchronization threshold. Instead, increasing decentralization can induce a non-monotonic dependence of the critical coupling strength and lead to a double phase transition in frequency synchronization. These behaviors remain robust under asymmetric inertia between consumers and generators. Even when empirical power-generation and power-consumption distributions are considered, a region in which the critical threshold remains nearly constant is observed as decentralization increases. Our results demonstrate that decentralization can give rise to complex collective dynamics and caution against assuming that decentralization alone ensures improved frequency synchronization.

    "abstract": "           We develop a microscopic quantum theory of surface plasmon polaritons valid for arbitrary metal-dielectric geometries. Our framework is based on the Power-Zienau-Woolley representation of quantum electrodynamics, which provides an optimal separation between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and is therefore particularly well suited for constructing quantum descriptions of polaritonic excitations in strongly dispersive media. Within this formulation, the fundamental electronic oscillator is identified as the bulk plasmon mode, which is nonperturbatively coupled to the radiative continuum of free photon modes. This coupling induces a geometry-dependent renormalization of the bulk plasma frequency, giving rise to confined plasmonic resonances. As specific applications, we recover the localized surface plasmon modes of metallic nanoparticles, including radiative frequency shifts and decay, as well as the exact dispersion relation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons at planar interfaces. Our quantum treatment further reveals that light-matter interactions at metal-dielectric interfaces are inherently in the ultrastrong coupling regime. As a result, in the quasistatic limit, the system exhibits unconventional ground-state quantum fluctuations that can be controlled through the refractive index. These results open new intriguing perspectives in the field of quantum plasmonics.         ",

Here, we demonstrate that amorphous Ge (a-Ge) films overcome this limitation, possessing inherent ultrashort carrier lifetimes ~ 1.11-1.38 ps. We leverage this property to demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, coherent THz pulse detection using undoped a-Ge-on-Si PCAs. We present a comparative study of devices fabricated on a-Ge films grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and DC magnetron sputtering. The PECVD-Ge device, with better homogeneity and a smoother morphology in the films, demonstrates superior performance for both THz emission and detection. As an emitter, the PECVD-Ge PCA achieves a 40 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a bandwidth of ~ 3 THz. As a detector, it achieves a 32 dB SNR and a ~ 2 THz bandwidth, representing a ~2.5-fold increase in detected signal amplitude over the sputtered-Ge device. These results establish amorphous Ge-on-Si as a viable and scalable platform for both THz generation and detection, paving the way for fully integrated Si-based THz time-domain systems.         ",

The core of our method is a reconfigurable electro-optic comb generator capable of producing a sequence of known comb spectra to interrogate a spectroscopic sample. Instead of recording spectrally resolved or interferometric data, our system captures a set of integrated optical power measurements--one per probe comb--from which the sample's spectral response is computationally reconstructed by solving an inverse problem. We present the theoretical foundations of this method, assess its limitations, and validate it through numerical simulations. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the experimental reconstruction of several spectral signatures, including a molecular absorption line at 1545 nm. For these results, we use numerically computed spectra and experimentally measured power values, all acquired within 10 milliseconds.

A primary challenge in this approach is the high computational cost associated with accurate quantum chemistry calculations.

However, the performance is diminished for ET reactions, particularly for multi-electron transfers involving reactive ions that are underrepresented in the OMol25 training data, revealing a key out-of-distribution limitation. To overcome this, we propose an optimal hybrid workflow that uses the FPs for efficient geometry optimization and thermochemical analysis, followed by a crucial single-point DFT energy refinement and an implicit solvation correction.

In this set-up, an initially excited two-level atom can emit a photon into the waveguide, where the propagating photon can be reflected by the terminal mirror of the waveguide or absorbed by the other atom, thus constructing various coherent feedback loops. We show that there can be two-photon, one-photon or zero-photon states in the waveguide, which can be controlled by the feedback loop length and the coupling strengths between the atoms and waveguide. The photonic states in the waveguide are analyzed in both the frequency domain and the spatial domain, and the transient process of photon emissions is better understood based on a comprehensive analysis using both domains. Interestingly, we clarify that this quantum coherent feedback network can be mathematically modeled as a linear control system with multiple delays, which are determined by the distances between atoms and the terminal mirror of the semi-infinite waveguide. Therefore, based on time-delayed linear control system theory, the influence of delays on the stability of the quantum state evolution and the steady-state atomic and photonic states is investigated, for both small and large delays.

    "title": "Surface Optimization of Aluminum Resonators for Robust Quantum Device Fabrication",
    "abstract": "           Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $\\delta_\\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \\times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\\mathrm{i} \\approx 1.9\\,\\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.
