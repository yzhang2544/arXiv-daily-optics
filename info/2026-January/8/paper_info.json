    "abstract": "           Aggregates of light harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes form the major exciton-relaying domain in the photosynthetic unit of purple bacteria. Application of a generalized master equation to pairs of the B850 units of LH2 complexes, where excitons predominantly reside, provide quantitative information on how the inter-LH2 exciton transfer depends on the distance, relative rotational angle, and the relative energies of the two LH2s. The distance dependence demonstrates significant enhancement of the rate due to quantum delocalization of excitons, the qualitative nature of which remains robust against the disorder. The angle dependence reflects isotropic nature of exciton transfer, which remains similar for the ensemble of disorder. The variation of the rate on relative excitation energies of LH2 exhibits resonance peaks, which however is fragile as the disorder becomes significant. Overall, the average transfer times between two LH2s are estimated to be in the range of 4 - 25 ps for physically plausible inter-LH2 distances.         ",

    "abstract": "           Over the last decade, frequency-domain in-situ high-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in diamond anvil cells (DACs) has been employed as a structural and electronic probe of condensed matter systems at pressures well into the megabar range. However, extensive spin interactions and sample heterogeneities under pressure often lead to significant spectral overlap, inhibiting independent observation of chemically similar spin sub-species in the same sample. In this work, we introduce a time-domain relaxometry framework specifically suited for DAC experiments, named muT2-NMR. Experimental flexibility and operational robustness are benchmarked on three hydrogen-rich molecular solids at pressures up to 72 GPa. We demonstrate that muT2-NMR can resolve individual molecular subunits in relaxation space, paving the way for novel high-pressure, high-resolution NMR applications in molecular solids.         ",

    "abstract": "           The rapid escalation of computing power driven by large-scale artificial intelligence is placing unprecedented demands on the bandwidth, latency, and energy efficiency of data-center interconnects (DCIs). Self-homodyne coherent (SHC) transmission is a promising architecture because it preserves the spectral efficiency of coherent detection while greatly simplifying digital signal processing, but its practical deployment is critically limited by random and often ultrafast state-of-polarization (SOP) fluctuations that induce carrier fading and destabilize coherent reception. Here we report the first integrated polarization controller based on thin-film lithium tantalate (TFLT), enabling reset-free polarization tracking at Mrad/s speeds. The four-stage electro-optic device exhibits polarization-dependent loss (PDL) below 0.3 dB, a half-wave voltage below 2.5 V, high modulation bandwidth, and negligible DC drift. To accommodate the finite tuning range of integrated phase shifters, we develop a finite-boundary gradient-descent (FBGD) control algorithm that ensures reset-free SOP evolution with no phase jump. The implemented adaptive polarization controller (APC) is validated through both standalone polarization-tracking measurements and a dual-polarization 16-QAM SHC 400-Gbps transmission system. Transient polarization disturbances can be tracked at speeds up to 2 Mrad/s, while stable reset-free operation under continuous polarization disturbances is maintained up to 1 Mrad/s. This reset-free performance represents more than doubling the state of the art, while the pre-FEC bit-error rates remain below the HD-FEC threshold under realistic DCI conditions and lightning-scale polarization disturbances. These results establish TFLT as a new platform for ultrafast, low-power, reset-free, and drift-free polarization control in coherent optical interconnects and beyond.         ",

For concreteness, we invoke deuterium-tritium (DT) as fuels. The intense electromagnetic field trapped inside the soliton significantly enhances the DT-fusion cross section, its ponderomotive potential evacuates electrons, and it accelerates D/T to kinetic energies suitable for fusion reaction. While electrons are expelled almost instantly, the much heavier D/T moves at picosecond time scale. Such a difference in time scales renders a time window for DT fusion to occur efficiently in an electron-free environment. We inject two consecutive lasers, where the first would excite plasma solitons and the second, much more intense and with a matched lower frequency, would fortify the soliton electromagnetic field resonantly. We impose a plasma density gradient to induce soliton motion. All D/T inside the plasma column swept by the moving soliton during its lifetime would participate in this fusion mechanism. We show that the breakeven condition is attainable. Invoking fiber laser and the iCAN laser technologies for high repetition rate and high intensity operation, gigawatt output maybe conceivable.         ",

To harness the capabilities that QC offers, we can integrate it into hybrid quantum-classical simulations, which can boost the capabilities of supercomputing by leveraging quantum modules that offer speedups over classical counterparts. One example is quantum Monte Carlo integration, which is theorised to achieve a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo, making it suitable for high-energy physics, strong-field QED, and multiple scientific and industrial applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that quantum Monte Carlo can be used to predict the number of pairs created when two photon beams collide head-on, a problem relevant to high-energy physics and intense laser-matter interactions. The results from the quantum simulations demonstrate high accuracy relative to theoretical predictions. The accuracy of the simulations is only constrained by the approximations required to embed polynomials and to initialise the quantum state. We also demonstrate that our algorithm can be used in current quantum hardware, providing up to 90 % accuracy relative to theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we propose pathways towards integrations with classical simulation codes.         ",

    "abstract": "           Accurately modeling quantum dissipative dynamics remains challenging due to environmental complexity and non-Markovian memory effects. Although machine learning provides a promising alternative to conventional simulation techniques, most existing models employ real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) that inherently mismatch the complex-valued nature of quantum mechanics. By decoupling the real and imaginary parts of the density matrix, RVNNs can obscure essential amplitude-phase correlations, compromising physical consistency. Here, we introduce complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) as a physics-consistent framework for learning quantum dissipative dynamics. CVNNs operate directly on complex-valued inputs, preserve the algebraic structure of quantum states, and naturally encode quantum coherences. Through numerical benchmarks on the spin-boson model and several variants of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, we demonstrate that CVNNs outperform RVNNs in convergence speed, training stability, and physical fidelity -- including significantly improved trace conservation and Hermiticity. These advantages increase with system size and coherence complexity, establishing CVNNs as a robust, scalable, quantum-aware classical approach for simulating open quantum systems in the pre-fault-tolerant quantum era.

We study silicon nanoparticle (Si NP)-epoxy composites using combined Raman and Brillouin spectroscopy under local(laser-induced) and global(stage-controlled) heating. Raman spectra reveal THz longitudinal optical(LO) phonon softening and spectral broadening under local heating, indicating nanoscale hot-spots and interfacial scattering. Brillouin data track GHz longitudinal acoustic(LA) phonons, showing temperature- and concentration-dependent evolution of elasticity and damping. Contrasting heating methods unravels Si loading thresholds for isolated thermal absorbers, thermal percolation, acoustic attenuation and elastic homogenization. Local heating induces greater phonon softening and damping than global heating, with this disparity amplified at higher loadings by thermal gradients and interfacial dissipation. Global heating correlates with viscoelastic relaxation, showing intensified acoustic attenuation near the glass transition. Raman thermometry coupled with finite-element opto-thermal modeling allows evaluation of thermal conductivity of the composites characterized by increase from 0.09 to 0.46 W/(mK) for 0.07 up to 2 wt% of Si NPs, respectively, outperforming SiC nanowires at 2 wt% [D.

Silicon nitride is widely accessible and low loss into the visible, but most demonstrations rely on telecom pumping and thick stress-managed films, where the large spectral gap to the visible dispersive wave raises the soliton order and power required for efficient conversion. Here we show that pumping closer to the visible provides a complementary route. Starting from crack-free 400 nm SiN films, we implement dispersion-engineering with air-clad nanophotonic waveguides whose enhanced geometric dispersion opens an anomalous-dispersion window across the Ti-sapphire tuning range. Femtosecond Ti-sapphire pulses then drive octave-spanning combs from the visible to the near-infrared, with the visible edge and overall bandwidth lithographically tuned by the waveguide width at pulse energies of only tens of picojoules. The air-clad geometry also produces strong polarization-dependent dispersion, enabling switching between all-normal and soliton-dominated broadening in the same device, and support octave-spanning combs at 1 GHz repetition rates directly driven by a compact diode-pumped Ti-sapphire oscillator. These results position air-clad SiN nanophotonic waveguides as an efficient interface between emerging short-wavelength integrated gain platforms and fully integrated visible frequency-comb engines.

We demonstrate that ISR admits a stable mixed equilibrium of ISR and unconditional defection (ALLD), and that costly punishment can become productive: When sufficiently efficient, it raises collective welfare above the no-punishment baseline. ALLD players persist as evolutionary shields, preventing invasion by unconditional cooperation (ALLC) or alternative conditional strategies (e.g., antisocial punishment). At the same time, the mixed equilibrium of ISR and ALLD remains robust under modest complexity costs that destabilize other symmetric cooperative systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Scaling superconducting quantum computers to the fault-tolerant regime calls for a commensurate scaling of the classical control and readout stack. Today's systems largely rely on room-temperature, rack-based instrumentation connected to dilution-refrigerator cryostats through many coaxial cables. Looking ahead, superconducting fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs) will likely adopt a heterogeneous quantum-classical architecture that places selected electronics at cryogenic stages -- for example, cryo-CMOS at 4~K and superconducting digital logic at 4~K and/or mK stages -- to curb wiring and thermal-load overheads. This review distills key requirements, surveys representative room-temperature and cryogenic approaches, and provides a transparent first-order accounting framework for cryoelectronics. Using an RSA-2048-scale benchmark as a concrete reference point, we illustrate how scaling targets motivate constraints on multiplexing and stage-wise cryogenic power, and discuss implications for functional partitioning across room-temperature electronics, cryo-CMOS, and superconducting logic.

    "title": "Surface Optimization of Aluminum Resonators for Robust Quantum Device Fabrication",
    "abstract": "           Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $\\delta_\\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \\times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\\mathrm{i} \\approx 1.9\\,\\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.

    "abstract": "           Thermal diffusivity of solid materials is commonly measured using laser flash analysis. This technique involves applying a heat pulse to the front surface of a small sample of the material and calculating the thermal diffusivity from the resulting increase in temperature on the back surface. Current formulas for the thermal diffusivity are based on the assumption that heat is transported within the sample according to the standard heat equation. While this assumption is valid in most practical cases, it admits the non-physical property of infinite propagation speed, that is, the heat pulse applied at the front surface is instantaneously perceived at the back surface. This paper carries out a mathematical analysis to determine the effect of replacing the standard heat equation in laser flash analysis by the Cattaneo heat equation, which exhibits finite propagation speed through the inclusion of a relaxation time in the Fourier law. The main results of the paper include (i) analytical insights into the spatiotemporal behaviour of temperature within the sample and (ii) analytical formulas for determining the thermal diffusivity and relaxation time of the sample. Numerical experiments exploring and verifying the analytical results are presented with supporting MATLAB code made publicly available.         ",

    "abstract": "           We compare two methods for evaluating the cardinality of the Cartesian product $N \\times N$ of the set of natural numbers $N$. The first is used to explain the thermodynamics of black body radiation by using convergent functions on $N \\times N$. The cardinality of $N \\times N$ enters through the partition function, internal energy and entropy for every macrostate given by a normal mode of electromagnetic wave. Here, $N \\times N$ is assigned a greater cardinality than $N$. The second method was devised in analysis to count the rational numbers by using divergent functions on $N \\times N$. Here, $N \\times N$ is not assigned a greater cardinality than $N$. In this article, we show that the experimentally confirmed first approach is mathematically more consistent with the definition of the real line and foundations of topology. It also provides a quantitative measure of the cardinality of $N \\times N$ relative to that of N. Similar arguments show that the set of rational numbers is not countable. This article suggests that the axiom of choice is a more rigorous technique to prove the existence theorems for connection and metric on the spacetime manifold than the usual application of second-countability.

    "abstract": "           Silicon is a promising anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to its exceptionally high specific capacity (3600 mAh g$^{-1}$), significantly exceeding that of conventional graphite. However, its practical application is hindered by substantial volume expansion (300-400%) during lithiation, leading to mechanical degradation and capacity fade. A graphite-coated silicon core-shell structure has been proposed to mitigate these issues by combining silicon's capacity with graphite's structural stability. Despite this, experimental studies have shown that the usable capacity of such composite electrodes can remain low, often below 40% at 1C, especially under high-rate cycling. In this work, we develop a physics-based electrochemical model to investigate the charge-discharge behaviour, rate limitations, and degradation mechanisms of silicon-graphite core-shell anodes. The model incorporates lithium transport, interfacial kinetics, evolving contact area due to silicon expansion, and a simplified cracking framework to capture loss of active material. Results are validated against key experimental trends and used to explore the effects of particle size, shell thickness, and charge protocol, offering insights into the design of more durable and efficient Si-based composite anodes.

Further, we demonstrate the use of this technique in an existing plasma accelerator system using readily available hardware components. Finally, we illustrate the potential application of this method to multi-GeV laser plasma acceleration and the generation of flying foci, research areas which would significantly benefit from improved programmatic structuring of high-intensity laser pulses.

    "abstract": "           We revisit the interaction of an initially uniform near-inertial wave (NIW) field with a steady background flow, with the goal of predicting the subsequent organization of the wave field. To wit, we introduce an exact analogy between the Young Ben Jelloul (YBJ) equation and the quantum dynamics of a charged particle in a steady electromagnetic field, whose potentials are expressed in terms of the background flow. We derive the time-averaged spatial distributions of wave kinetic energy, potential energy and Stokes drift in two asymptotic limits. In the `strongly quantum' limit where the background flow is weak compared to wave dispersion, we compute the wave statistics by extending a strong-dispersion expansion initially introduced by YBJ. In the `quasi-classical' limit where the background flow is strong compared to wave dispersion, we compute the wave statistics by leveraging the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical systems. We compare our predictions to numerical simulations of the YBJ equation, using an instantaneous snapshot from a two-dimensional turbulent flow as the steady background flow. The agreement is very good in both limits. In particular, we quantitatively describe the preferential concentration of NIW energy in anticyclones. We predict weak NIW concentration in both asymptotic limits of weak and strong background flow, and maximal anticyclonic concentration for background flows of intermediate strength, providing theoretical underpinning to observations reported by Danioux, Vanneste and B\u00fchler (Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 773, 2015).
