    "title": "Cyclotron Radiation Signal Characterization in Resonant Cavities for the Project 8 Neutrino Mass Experiment",
    "abstract": "           Many experimental methods in physics require understanding radiation from single particles into non-trivial electromagnetic mode structures. Such characterization is critical for Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES), an advancing new measurement technique that has the potential to greatly benefit fundamental physics measurements. In CRES, charged particles emit cyclotron radiation at frequencies that provide their energy measurement. As a notable example, the Project 8 experiment aims to kinematically infer the neutrino mass by measuring the energies of electrons emitted in tritium beta decay using CRES. In near-term realizations of Project 8, resonant cylindrical cavities will be used for CRES readout, in a configuration with a magnetic field oriented along the symmetry axis, and electrons following helical cyclotron trajectories confined to the cavity interior. The physics of electromagnetic radiation in these environments is complicated, since it involves both the motion of the emitting particle and the mode structure imposed by the cavity. In this work, we derive and validate an analytic model for how an oscillating, trapped electron radiates into cavity modes, and the power and frequency content of the radiation that can be read out from these events. These results can be used to guide the design of cavities for future CRES and other experiments.         ",

Naturally, this is a destabilizing result: the teleological notion has long been rejected by science and even, for its finalistic character, viewed as a belief. We also show that, under the quantum cosmological assumption and for the Fine-tuned Universe version of the Anthropic Principle, the physical basis of the teleological character of quantum algorithms also applies to the evolutions of the living for which the teleological notion was conceived.

    "abstract": "           A state-of-the-art Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) facility, composed of a dedicated beamline and a 2D-RIXS spectrometer, has been constructed and commissioned at BL02U in NanoTerasu, Japan. This paper reports the optical design and optimization of this spectrometer, aiming for an ultrahigh energy resolution of <10 meV in the soft X-ray range. Conventional RIXS spectrometers using monochromatic incident X-rays suffer from a severe trade-off between energy resolution and measurement efficiency, which makes achieving resolutions of <10 meV practically unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we adopted the $h\\nu^2$ concept using dispersive incident X-rays, based on a comparative study. This approach decouples the energy resolution from the incident bandwidth. We estimate that our 2D-RIXS spectrometer improves efficiency by more than a factor of 10 compared to conventional spectrometers. The 2D-RIXS spectrometer has been successfully commissioned, demonstrating that sub-10 meV resolution measurement is achievable with practical throughput. While development continues towards the ultimate design resolution, the successful implementation validates the design strategy and offers a pathway for future high-performance RIXS instrumentation.

Recent developments in three-dimensional (3D) nanomagnetism have highlighted the growing need for imaging techniques that can capture magnetic structures across curved or tilted surfaces with high sensitivity. Though widely used as a powerful technique for imaging magnetization states, conventional magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy faces inherent limitations in measuring non-planar systems due to its shallow depth of field (DOF). Here, we present an extended depth of field MOKE imaging approach, combining through-focus scanning with image-stitching-based reconstruction, to obtain sharp and well-resolved magnetic domain images across non-planar sample geometries. The method is validated on both perpendicularly and in-plane magnetized films tilted on purpose for this study, enabling quantitative analysis of domain morphology and detection sensitivity. This laboratory-accessible technique provides a fast and versatile route for 3D magnetic imaging, complementing large-scale X-ray-based methods and offering a practical tool for investigating non-planar magnetic samples with tilted or curved 3D geometries.

In this note we explain why the proposal does not work as a modification of quantum theory. For two components, the new rule differs from the ordinary sum only by an overall scalar factor, so after normalization it represents the same ray and cannot change any physical prediction. For three or more components, if one extends the two-term prescription in the natural recursive way, the result becomes bracket/order dependent and can even change the ray, so a \"state\" is no longer uniquely determined by a given preparation. We also clarify why the inclusion-exclusion argument and the optics analogy do not support a foundational change to Hilbert-space linearity.         ",

In this work, in addition to $O_2(a^{1}{\\Delta}g)$, $O_2(b^{1}{\\Sigma}g^{+})$ and its associated reactions are incorporated into a global/equivalent circuit model of an $Ar$/$O_2$ discharge.

Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we characterize the NbN response both in free space and within a high-$Q$ photonic-crystal cavity. Our analysis reveals significant cavity-induced modifications to the optical conductivity. A theoretical model indicates that these changes originate from a substantial ($\\sim13\\,\\%$) reduction in the superfluid density and a minor ($\\sim2\\,\\%$) reduction in the superconducting gap, driven by cavity vacuum fluctuations.

    "abstract": "           The sudden approximation is a fundamental tool for describing ultrafast quantum transitions, yet the relationship between the initial 3D wavefunction and the final kinetic energy release (KER) remains poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that the observed fragment energy distribution $P(E)$ following a sudden Coulomb explosion is a direct manifestation of the initial state's 3D radial geometry. By applying a Bohmian-inspired local energy framework to Slater-type orbitals, we identify a universal \\textbf{``0.5 Rule''}: for ground-state configurations, the ratio of the peak detected energy to the integrated average energy ($R_E = E_{peak}/\\langle E \\rangle$) is strictly bounded below 0.5. Our systematic parametric study reveals that this ratio is highly sensitive to the orbital exponent $\\zeta$ and the principal quantum number $n$. Specifically, $R_E$ decreases significantly as $\\zeta$ increases, suggesting that the kinetic energy of fragments from inner-shell orbitals is far more suppressed than that of valence electrons. We further show that for excited states ($n > 1$), the emergence of secondary high-energy peaks provides a theoretical explanation for the structured KER spectra observed in $H_2^+$ ionization experiments. Finally, we propose that this geometric energy shift offers a new perspective on the ``missing energy'' problem in particle physics. Our findings suggest that a detected energy peak lower than the statistical mean may be an intrinsic signature of 3D quantum-spatial distribution ($r^2|\\psi|^2$) rather than proof of undetected particles. This work provides a rigorous framework for recalibrating experimental energy signals across atomic, molecular, and subatomic scales.         ",

In this work we present the design and the performance of an improved detector, where the KID acts only as sensor and is coupled to dedicated phonon collectors. The separation between the detector and the collectors increases the variation of the quasi-particle density within the device, thereby enhancing its responsivity. The meander of the KID is composed of a 77nm trilayer wire of Aluminum-Titanium-Aluminum, while the phonon collectors are made of a 100nm Aluminum layer and act as quasi-particles funnels. Inside the collectors, the absorbed athermal phonons generate quasi-particles which, after diffusion, are trapped in the lower-gap superconducting trilayer. The performance of this setup is compared to that of a standard phonon-mediated KID, showing an increase in responsivity by around a factor of five.         ",

    "abstract": "           Modern Quantum optics largely remains quasi-stationary, far from intrinsic optical field timescales. Ultrafast quantum optics seeks to generate, shape, and measure quantum states of light on femtosecond and attosecond timescales. Here we introduce a quantum light field squeezer (QLFS) that enables the generation and attosecond control of ultrafast broadband squeezed light. Using degenerate four-wave mixing in a quasi-collinear focusing geometry, our approach overcomes conventional broadband phase-matching limits, producing intensity- and phase-squeezed states directly from few-cycle laser pulses. Our ultrafast quantum optical metrology reveals a time-dependent squeezing distribution across individual half-cycles of the electric field. Incorporating this time-dependent squeezing into strong-field simulations shows that the temporal redistribution of quantum uncertainty reshapes the high-harmonic emission. Moreover, by tuning the relative pulse delay and phase-matching angle, we achieve attosecond precision in controlling the squeezing characteristics by visualizing inferred effective Wigner representations of the quantum light field. Beyond characterization, we demonstrate that the quantum light-induced tunneling-current noise is sensitive to the nonclassical intensity-noise statistics of the driving squeezed light, with sub-femtosecond control. Together, these results extend the generation, control, and effective phase-space representation of squeezed light into the ultrafast and attosecond regime, opening new avenues for quantum optics in strong-field and solid-state systems.

    "abstract": "           We explore the experimental predictions of the local scale invariant, non-Hermitian pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) formulation of quantum theory introduced in arXiv:2601.03567. We use Weyl's definition of gravitational radius of charge to obtain the fine-structure constant for non-integrable scale effects $\\alpha_S$. The minuteness of $\\alpha_S$ relative to $\\alpha$ ($\\alpha_S/\\alpha \\sim 10^{-21}$) effectively hides the effects in usual quantum experiments. In an Aharonov-Bohm double-slit experiment, the theory predicts that the position probability density depends on which slit the particle trajectory crosses, due to a non-integrable scale induced by the magnetic flux. This experimental prediction can be realistically tested for an electrically neutral, heavy molecule with mass $m \\sim 10^{-19} \\text{g}$ at a $\\sim 10^6 \\text{ esu}$ flux regime. We analyse the Weyl-Einstein debate on the second-clock effect using the theory and show that spectral frequencies are history-independent. We thereby resolve Einstein's key objection against local scale invariance, and obtain two further experimental predictions. First, spectral intensities turn out to be history-dependent. Second, energy eigenvalues are modified by tiny imaginary corrections that modify spectral linewidths. We argue that the trajectory dependence of the probabilities renders our theory empirically distinguishable from other quantum formulations that do not use pilot-wave trajectories, or their mathematical equivalents, to derive experimental predictions.

Originally proposed to bypass the limitations imposed by von Neumann's theorem on the impossibility of hidden-variable models in quantum mechanics, it faced strong opposition from the outset. Over time, however, its use in tackling specific problems across various branches of physics has led to a gradual shift in attitude, turning the early resistance into a more moderate acceptance. A plausible explanation for this change may be that, since the late 1990s and early 2000s, Bohmian mechanics has been taking on a more operational and practical role. The original hidden-variable idea has gradually faded from its framework, giving way to a more pragmatic approach that treats it as a suitable analytical and computational tool. This discussion explores how and why such a shift in perspective has occurred and, therefore, answers questions such as whether Bohmian mechanics should be considered once and for all a legitimate quantum representation (i.e., worth being taught in elementary quantum mechanics courses) or, by extension, whether these ideas can be transferred to and benefit other fields. Here, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and several specific numerical examples are re-examined in the light of a less restrictive view than the standard one usually adopted in quantum mechanics.

    "title": "Rapid wavefront shaping using an optical gradient acquisition",
    "abstract": "           Wavefront shaping systems aim to image deep into scattering tissue by reshaping incoming and outgoing light to correct aberrations caused by tissue inhomogeneity However, the desired modulation depends on the unknown tissue structure and therefore its estimation is a challenging time-consuming task. Most strategies rely on coordinate descent optimization, which sequentially varies each modulation parameter and assesses its impact on the resulting image. We propose a rapid wavefront shaping scheme that transitions from coordinate descent to gradient descent optimization, using the same measurement to update all modulation parameters simultaneously. To achieve this, we have developed an analytical framework that expresses the gradient of the wavefront shaping score with respect to all modulation parameters. Although this gradient depends on the unknown tissue structure, we demonstrate how it can be inferred from the optical system's measurements. Our new framework enables rapid inference of wavefront shaping modulations. Additionally, since the complexity of our algorithm does not scale with the number of modulation parameters, we can achieve very high-resolution modulations, leading to better corrections in thicker tissue layers. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework in correcting aberrations in a coherent confocal microscope.         ",

    "title": "High-Fidelity Integrated Quantum Photonic Logic Via Robust Directional Couplers",
    "abstract": "           Scalable quantum information processing with integrated photonics requires quantum logic operations with high fidelity and robustness. Directional couplers, the fundamental elements enabling quantum interference and logic operations, are inherently sensitive to fabrication imperfections and environmental fluctuations, leading to reduced gate fidelities. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a passive design strategy that mitigates these errors by exploiting a stationary geometrical configuration in uniform directional couplers, where first-order variations in the coupling coefficient are intrinsically suppressed. The robust geometry is implemented in a silicon-on-insulator photonic chip hosting two-photon controlled-NOT (CNOT) quantum gates and its performance is directly compared to a non-optimized design. Measurements indicate a mean gate fidelity of $93.30 \\pm 0.11\\%$, representing a clear improvement over the non-robust implementation mean fidelity of $91.93 \\pm 0.17\\%$, without any active tuning or footprint increase. This performance approaches the theoretical limit of $93.78\\%$, imposed by the imperfect source. Monte Carlo simulations incorporating realistic fabrication noise confirm the observed enhancement and reveal consistent suppression of gate-level error rates. These results demonstrate a compact, fabrication-tolerant building block for scalable, fault-tolerant photonic quantum circuits and highlight the power of passive geometric error mitigation in quantum hardware design.

In this paper we theoretically unveil a hierarchy of topological phases under broken time-reversal symmetry, which include the first-order Chern, and the second-order dipole, quadrupole phases. Concretely, by relaxing a certain spatial symmetry of unit cell, versatile topological phases including both edge and corner states can be established to transit around, with bandgap closures marking the phase boundaries. Our results on gyromagnetic photonic crystals may broaden the scope of sublattice engineering design for topological phase manipulation, potentially enabling multifunctional disorder-resistant waveguides and integrated photonic circuits for information communication.

    "abstract": "           Three-body F\u00f6rster resonances controlled by a dc electric field are of interest for the implementation of three-qubit quantum gates with single atoms in optical traps using their laser excitation into strongly interacting Rydberg states. In our recent theoretical paper [Zh. Eksper. Teor. Fiz. 168(1), 14 (2025)] it was found that the proposed earlier three-body F\u00f6rster resonance $3\\times nP_{3/2} \\to nS_{1/2} +(n+1)S_{1/2} +nP_{1/2} $ in Rb Rydberg atoms has a splitting, with one of the split components having weaker dependence of the resonant electric field (and the corresponding dynamic shift) on the distance $R$ between the atoms. Here we study this effect in more detail, since such a resonance is the most suitable for performing experiments on observing coherent oscillations of populations of collective three-body states and implementing three-qubit quantum gates based on them. For a linear spatial configuration of three interacting Rydberg atoms, the physical mechanism of this phenomenon is revealed and analytical formulas are obtained that describe the behavior of split structure of the F\u00f6rster resonance depending on $R$. It is found that the splitting is a measure of the energy of the resonant dipole-dipole exchange interaction with an excitation hopping between neighboring Rydberg states $S$ and $P$.         ",

The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering.

In this work, we present an analytical framework allowing to find the stationary states and their bifurcations for the propagating fields in Kerr ring and Fabry-Perot resonators, which can be generalized to other nonlinear systems. Using tools from nonlinear algebra, namely, polynomial resultants and Groebner bases, we derive compact polynomial expressions describing the system's full solution in both intensity and amplitude representations. The bifurcations follow directly from these expressions, and are additionally characterized as exceptional points of an auxiliary linear non-Hermitian system. Together, these results unify optical bistability and spontaneous symmetry breaking within a single analytical framework, and offer a route toward improved control of nonlinear optical systems, and the design of photonic devices.

    "abstract": "           Adiabatic topological pumping enables robust transport of energy and information, yet its operational speed is fundamentally constrained by the instantaneous adiabatic condition, which necessitates prohibitively slow parameter variations. Here, we propose a paradigm shift from instantaneous to global adiabaticity. We derive a global adiabatic criterion (GAC) that establishes an absolute fidelity bound by controlling the root-mean-square nonadiabaticity. Building on this framework, we introduce a fluctuation-suppression acceleration criterion to minimize spatial inhomogeneity, allowing for a safe increase in mean nonadiabaticity without compromising fidelity. We experimentally demonstrate this principle in femtosecond-laser-written photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays via scalable power-law coupling modulation. Our accelerated topological pumping achieves a fidelity of >0.95 with a fivefold reduction in device length compared to conventional schemes, exhibits the predicted linear scaling with system size, and maintains robust performance across a bandwidth exceeding 400 nm. This GAC framework provides a universal design rule for fast, compact, and robust adiabatic devices across both quantum and classical topological platforms.         ",

    "abstract": "           The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.

We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how an isomer's state space is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify isomers whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or \"fiber\" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates.
