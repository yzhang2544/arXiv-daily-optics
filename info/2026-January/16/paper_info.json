    "abstract": "           Partially coherent light is typically studied in the context of freely propagating continuous fields. Recent developments have indicated the existence of a `coherence advantage' in multimode optical communications, where partially coherent light outperforms coherent light. However, exploiting partial coherence in such applications requires manipulating multimode field coherence in programmable on-chip platforms. We present here the first example of on-chip synthesis and characterization of two-mode optical fields in an integrated on-chip hexagonal mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Starting with incoherent two-mode light, we adjust the degree of coherence on the chip with non-unitary transformations, construct $2\\times2$ unitary transformations to synthesize prescribed coherence matrices, and reconstruct the coherence matrices via measurements of the spatial Stokes parameters. These results indicate the possibility of deploying programmable photonics for producing large-dimensional structured partially coherent light for applications in communications, cryptography, sensing, and spectroscopy.

Classical configuration-interaction methods, while rigorous, suffer from exponential scaling, rendering them impractical for large or strongly correlated systems. Overcoming this limitation is central to realizing the promise of quantum computing in chemistry. Here, we investigate the pyridine-Li ion complex using three quantum algorithms: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the subspace quantum diagonalization (SQD) method, and the recently introduced handover iterative VQE (HI-VQE). Our results demonstrate how new generations of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks overcome the scalability and noise sensitivity that constrain conventional VQE approaches. SQD and HI-VQE achieve ground-state energy calculations for problem sizes inaccessible to classical computation, marking a clear advance toward quantum advantage. In particular, HI-VQE enables calculations within active spaces as large as (24e,22o), requiring 44 qubits-well beyond the reach of classical CASCI and VQE. This capability provides a systematic pathway for incorporating increasing numbers of electrons into quantum treatment, thereby approaching exact molecular energies. Importantly, both SQD and HI-VQE exhibit robustness against hardware noise, a critical improvement over earlier approaches. By enabling quantum simulations of molecular systems previously deemed intractable, SQD and HI-VQE offer a realistic route toward practical quantum advantage in computational chemistry. The comparison between HI-VQE and SQD shows that optimizing circuit parameters is crucial for accurate simulation.         ",

In quantum bianisotropy, magnetoelectric (ME) energy plays a critical role in mediating and enhancing light matter interactions. This concept is essential for bridging the gap between classical electromagnetics (where bianisotropy often involves field nonlocality) and quantum mechanics in metamaterials. The precise manipulation of a quantum emitter's properties at a subwavelength scale is due to near fields, which effectively function as a tunable environment. We show that the ME near field, interpreted as a structure combining the effect of bianisotropy (chirality) with a quantum atmosphere, is a nonMaxwellian field with spacetime symmetry breaking. Quantum ME fields arise from the dynamic modulation and topological coupling of magnetization and electric polarization within ME meta atoms, specific subwavelength structural elements with magnetic and dielectric subsystems in magnetic insulators.

We address this issue by introducing an NN-based DOCT method that generates high-definition logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) -based DOCT images from only four OCT volumes, whereas the conventional method required 32 volumes. The NN model successfully generates an LIV image that is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the LIV image computed from 32 volumes. This approach significantly reduces data size, transfer time, and processing time for DOCT imaging by a factor of eight.

The direction of the lasing emission is tailored through outcoupling via second-order Bragg diffraction and Rayleigh anomaly conditions, supporting both normal and oblique emission. Experiments reveal discrete lasing outputs across ~100 nm bandwidth (548-648 nm), spanning nearly the full Rhodamine 6G emission band, with thresholds as low as ~7 nJ per pulse (35.7 uJ/cm^2) and up to four concurrent lasing peaks from a single device.

The QGT unifies two pieces of band geometry: its real part defines a metric that quantifies how rapidly wave polarization changes with parameters, while its imaginary part is the Berry curvature that controls geometric phases and topological invariants. We obtain compact, symmetry-guided expressions for all three bands, highlighting the transverse structure of the metric and the monopole-like Berry curvature that yields Chern numbers for the Poincar\u00e9 bands.

We show how, despite appearances, this does not break the unitary requirements of quantum mechanics. We also find that an isotropic quantum emitter can be either reflective or transmissive to light depending on the waveguide polarisation at the emitter location, indeed in the zero loss limit such a system changes from 100% transmission to 100% reflection due to an infinitesimal polarisation rotation.

SRIM provides reliable implantation estimates for compact geometries, whereas PHITS reproduces GEANT4 results with comparable accuracy and additionally generates muonic X-ray spectra. These spectra, however, exhibit a systematic energy offset in the K-line transitions of medium- and high-Z elements relative to theoretical and experimental values. Despite this bias, PHITS accurately captures relative intensities and spectral shapes, enabling element-specific line identification.

It also maintains low runtimes even in extreme cases where classical MILP solvers fail to converge, such as designs involving over 50 million variables. The computationally intensive local sub-problems, which are essentially Binary Integer Programming (BIP) problems, can potentially be accelerated by quantum computing via their equivalent Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. Enabled by the MDW decomposition, the resulting QUBO formulation requires only sparse qubit connectivity and incurs a QUBO construction cost that scales linearly with problem size, potentially accelerating BIP sub-problem solutions by an additional order of magnitude. All observed and estimated speedups become increasingly significant with larger problem sizes and when moving from single-material to multi-material designs. This suggests that this new method, along with quantum computing, will play an increasingly valuable role in addressing the scale and complexity of real-world TO applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           We propose a scheme to transfer molecules from a slow beam into an optical trap using only a single photon absorption and emission cycle. The efficiency of such a scheme is numerically explored for BaF using realistic experimental parameters. The technique makes use of the state-dependent potential in an external electric field to trap molecules from an initial velocity of order 10 m/s. A rapid optical transition at the point where the molecules come to a standstill in the electric field potential irreversibly transfers them into a ~7 mk optical lattice trap. For a pulsed Stark decelerated beam, we estimated the per-shot efficiency to be ~0.52% or up to ~10$^4$ molecules, with a potential factor 2 improvement when the fields are synchronously modulated with the arriving velocity components. The irreversibility of the scheme allows for larger numbers to be built up over time. Since this scheme does not rely on a closed cycling transition for laser cooling, it broadens the range of molecules that can be used for research on cold molecular chemistry, quantum information, and fundamental interactions in optical traps.

    "abstract": "           Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential tools for unraveling atomistic insights into the structure and dynamics of condensed-phase systems. However, the universal and accurate prediction of macroscopic properties from ab initio calculations remains a significant challenge, often hindered by the trade-off between computational cost and simulation accuracy. Here, we present ByteFF-Pol, a graph neural network (GNN)-parameterized polarizable force field, trained exclusively on high-level quantum mechanics (QM) data. Leveraging physically-motivated force field forms and training strategies, ByteFF-Pol exhibits exceptional performance in predicting thermodynamic and transport properties for a wide range of small-molecule liquids and electrolytes, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) classical and machine learning force fields. The zero-shot prediction capability of ByteFF-Pol bridges the gap between microscopic QM calculations and macroscopic liquid properties, enabling the exploration of previously intractable chemical spaces. This advancement holds transformative potential for applications such as electrolyte design and custom-tailored solvent, representing a pivotal step toward data-driven materials discovery.         ",

    "abstract": "           Systematic exploration of amorphous ABC heterostructures revealed that nanoscale morphological modifications markedly improved their artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures were fabricated through plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking the centrosymmetry on the nanoscale. We observe a dependence of the optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials, SiO$_2$, TiO$_2$, and Al$_2$O$_3$, ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these thin films exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\\chi_{zzz} = 2.0 \\pm 0.2$~pm/V at the wavelength of 1032~nm is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.

    "abstract": "           We present a systematic study of interchannel quantum interference in laser-induced nonsequential double ionization (NSDI) within the strong-field approximation. Focusing on the below-threshold intensity regime where the recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI) pathway dominates, we derive analytical phase conditions governing interference between distinct excitation channels for arbitrary driving fields. To quantify the interplay between channels resulting from a vast number of interfering processes, we introduce statistical metrics based on the Earth Mover's Distance, allowing us to assess the relative weight of each channel's contribution to the two-electron photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs). We identify key factors that determine whether interchannel interference is appreciable such as comparable channel intensities, strong spatial overlap between the excited-state wavefunctions and the energy difference between contributing channels. We demonstrate that for linearly polarized few-cycle pulses, the typical intrachannel interference features associated with exchange, temporal shifts and combined exchange-temporal interference are retained with interchannel interference. Our findings establish a hierarchy of interference mechanisms in RESI and may provide practical guidelines for enhancing or suppressing interference in different regions of the momentum plane. The toolkit presented in this work is transferable to a wide range of interferometric schemes involving different excitation channels.         ",

    "title": "Patch-MLP-Based Predictive Control: Simulation of Upstream Pointing Stabilization for PHELIX Laser System",
    "abstract": "           High-energy laser facilities such as PHELIX at GSI require excellent beam pointing stability for reproducibility and relative independence for future experiments. Beam pointing stability has been traditionally achieved using simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control which removes the problem of slow drift, but is limited because of the time delay in knowing the diagnosis and the inertia in the mechanical system associated with mirrors. In this work, we introduce a predictive control strategy where the forecasting of beam pointing errors is performed by a patch-based multilayer perceptron (Patch-MLP) designed to capture local temporal patterns for more robust short-term jitter prediction. The subsequent conversion of these predicted errors into correction signals is handled by a PID controller. The neural network has been trained on diagnostic time-series data to predict beam pointing error. Using the feed-forward controller compensates for system delays. Simulations with a correction mirror placed upstream of the PHELIX pre-amplifier bridge confirm that the predictive control scheme reduces residual jitter compared to conventional PID control. Over a 10-hour dataset the controller maintained stable performance without drift, while standard pointing metrics showed consistent improvements of the order of 10 to 20 percent. The predictive controller operates without drift, and therefore may improve reproducibility and operational efficiency in high energy, low repetition rate laser experiment conditions.         ",

    "abstract": "           We report a fundamental geometric constraint on the detection of kinetic energy release (KER) in three-dimensional quantum fragmentation. By investigating the sudden dissociation of Slater-type orbitals, physically motivated basis for localized states, we demonstrate that the ratio of the peak detected energy to the integrated mean, $R_E = E_{\\text{peak}}/\\langle E \\rangle$, is strictly bounded below $0.5$ for all physical parameter spaces. We systematically map the behavior of $R_E$ across the orbital localization ($\\zeta$) and effective repulsive charge ($Q$) landscape. Our results show that while $R_E$ exhibits sensitivity to the force-field geometry at atomic scales, it converges to a remarkably stable, scale-invariant constant of $\\approx 0.33$ in the high-localization limit ($M \\propto \\zeta$) characteristic of subatomic ground states ($n=1$,$Q=1$). This $1/3$ geometric constant provides a provocative first-principles interpretation of the historical ``missing energy'' problem in nuclear physics. We suggest that the $1/3$ average energy ratio observed in Beta decay spectra may be a topological artifact of the $4\\pi r^2$ volume weighting inherent to 3D wavefunctions, rather than exclusively a signature of undetected mass. This work establishes $R_E < 0.5$ as a universal geometric baseline for quantum simulations and offers a new framework for reconstructing the true energy budget in subatomic calorimetry by correcting for the intrinsic masking effects of 3D radial geometry.

Additionally, we introduce a taper-free interface that allows terahertz waves to directly couple from a metallic hollow waveguide without requiring dielectric insertion. By engineering slot couplers with an effectivemedium channel for impedance and modal matching, the waveguide achieves a fractional 3-dB bandwidth of 40% with a maximum coupling efficiency of 90% in the WR-2.2 band (330-500 GHz). By employing a broadband uni-traveling-carrier photodiode transmitter and sub-harmonic mixer receivers, we achieve an aggregated data rate of 0.8 Tbit/s with quadrature amplitude modulation schemes across 14 channels from 330-600 GHz. The effective-medium-slot waveguide platform yields robust broadband coupling with enhanced mechanical protection, offering reliable interconnects for ultra-high-speed terahertz integrated systems.

    "abstract": "           Rare-earth metal oxyhydride compositions are currently attracting increasing attention to develop materials with unusual optical responses. Herein, using computer simulations of the electronic and optical properties, the optical responses of two stable yttrium oxyhydride compounds, Y4H10O and YHO, are studied for the visible light range. The emphasis is on modeling macroscopic optical characteristics, which are numerically derived within a conventional scheme using refractive indices, and absorption, transmittance, and reflection spectra. The main goal is twofold: first, to simulate spectral behavior of different single-phase and two-phase oxyhydride compositions and second, to conduct a comparative analysis that could explain the features of the transmission spectra measured for different samples. Based on the obtained results, models of new optical coatings are proposed in which yttrium oxyhydrides play the key role. In the context of nonlinear optics, the frequency profile of the second-order susceptibility for the noncentrosymmetric cubic structure of Y4H10O is evaluated and it is shown that this system could exhibit large optical nonlinearity.
