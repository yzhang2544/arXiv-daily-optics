    "abstract": "           Rigorous quantum dynamics calculations provide essential insights into complex scattering phenomena across atomic and molecular physics, chemical reaction dynamics, and astrochemistry. However, the application of the gold-standard quantum coupled-channel (CC) method has been fundamentally constrained by a steep cubic scaling of computational cost [${O}(N^3)$]. Here, we develop a general, rigorous, and robust method for solving the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a single column of the scattering S-matrix with quadratic scaling [${O}(N^2)$] in the number of channels. The Weinberg-regularized Iterative Series Expansion (WISE) algorithm resolves the divergence issues affecting iterative techniques by applying a regularization procedure to the kernel of the multichannel Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. The method also explicitly incorporates closed-channel effects, including those responsible for multichannel Feshbach resonances. We demonstrate the power of this approach by performing rigorous calculations on He + CO and CO + N$_2$ collisions, achieving exact quantum results with demonstrably quadratic scaling. Our results establish a new computational paradigm, enabling state-to-state quantum scattering computations for complex molecular systems and providing a novel window onto the intricate multichannel molecular collision dynamics.

    "title": "A Liquid Density Sensor Based On AlN Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transmitter Insensitive to Liquid Viscosity",
    "abstract": "           To overcome the limitations of conventional liquid density sensors, MEMS-based approaches have been developed. However, the viscosity-density coupling effect often compromises accuracy in high-viscosity liquids. Although various decoupling strategies have been proposed, they often suffer from complexity and inefficiency. This study presents an AlN-based PMUT liquid density sensor insensitive to viscosity interference. The sensor employs two identical PMUTs, functioning as transmitter and receiver, respectively. An ultrasonic wave generated by the transmitter is reflected by the liquid surface and detected by the receiver. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that when the excitation frequency remains constant, the amplitude of the received electrical signal exhibits a specific relationship with liquid density, while the viscosity-induced signal amplitude variation becomes negligible. Therefore, after calibrating the PMUT liquid density sensor by fitting the relationship between received signal amplitude and density across 0-100% glycerol solutions, the device can measure densities within this range regardless of liquid type and viscosity. Experimental results show that the sensor can accurately measure the density of the propylene glycol solutions using the glycerol-calibrated fitting formula, with the calculated density error rate between measured propylene glycol solutions using the glycerol-calibrated fitting formula and actual densities remains below 0.125%, demonstrating measurement insensitivity to viscosity differences between the two liquids. The proposed method achieves maximum error rates of less than 2.5% in high-viscosity environments (80%-100% glycerol solutions), which is 20% that of other density measurement methods based on resonant frequency. The developed PMUT liquid density sensor exhibits a measurable density range from 0.789 to 1.261 g/cm3.         ",

    "abstract": "           Artificial intelligence, an emerging, powerful and efficient computational tool, has played a crucial role in the design of optical devices. For the design of holographic metasurfaces, traditional algorithms require multiple iterations between the metasurface and target planes, resulting in excessive computation time. Here, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed for the fast design of terahertz three-dimensional (3D) holographic metasurfaces. Trained in a self-supervised manner, the PINN eliminates the need for paired input-label datasets. After training, the PINN enables end-to-end mapping between the target holographic patterns and metasurface structures. Both simulation and experimental results of single-plane and 3D multi-plane holography demonstrate that metasurfaces designed by PINN offer higher imaging quality than traditional iterative algorithms. Moreover, the PINN can find approximate solutions of metasurface structures even in physically counterintuitive scenarios, where the holographic patterns of two parallel imaging planes are completely distinct. Furthermore, the inference process of PINN typically takes less than 1 second, much faster than the traditional algorithms requiring iterative computation. Notably, the PINN simultaneously accounts for both phase and amplitude modulation, thereby outperforming traditional phase-only modulation algorithms in handling complex physical scenarios and offering superior imaging quality. This end-to-end design approach has the potential to pave the way for the realization of high-quality, real-time, and large-scale terahertz 3D holographic display technology.         ",

The QOCC harnesses high parallelism of light by wavelength-division multiplexing, processing high-dimensional data simultaneously through multiple optical wavelength channels. Compared to the electronic computing counterpart, our QOCC achieves higher computational fidelity (root mean square error < 0.035) and substantially reduced computational load (2/3 lower).

    "abstract": "           With the rapid advancement of metasurfaces and the increasing demand for programmable metasurfaces to simplify information systems, wave-based computation using metasurfaces has emerged as an attractive research topic. To facilitate the mathematical operations in electromagnetic (EM) space, here we propose a space-time coding metasurface (STCM) system capable of directly performing calculus operations on the spatial energy distributions of EM waves. By exploiting harmonic characteristics induced by time-varying coding, the responses of meta-atoms at specific harmonics can be flexibly controlled, which enables the metasurface system to address more complex tasks. Owing to its programmability, the STCM can dynamically switch functions in real time to accommodate different calculus tasks. To fully leverage the capability of STCM, we not only present the space-time coding sequences for differentiation and integration of EM waves, but also develop and numerically simulate the space-time coding sequences that can independently and simultaneously implement different calculus operations on the same incident EM waves. To experimentally validate the feasibility of the EM calculus operations, proof-of-concept experiments are conducted using a programmable 2-bit STCM. Good agreements among the theory, numerical simulations, and experiments confirm the feasibility of performing calculus operations in the EM space and demonstrate the broad application prospects of STCM in EM wave manipulations, wireless communications, and signal processing.

    "abstract": "           Optical chaos holds great promise for secure communication, LiDAR, and reinforcement learning. However, its scalability has long been constrained by an intrinsic trade-off between bandwidth and the number of parallel chaotic channels. Here, we introduce a programmable \"chaos-on-comb\" architecture that overcomes this limitation using standard electro-optic components. By heterodyning a delayed-feedback chaotic laser with a continuous-wave reference, a broadband chaotic microwave signal is generated to simultaneously drive a cascaded electro-optic comb, imprinting chaotic dynamics across all comb lines and merging them into an ultra-broadband chaotic continuum. Then, incorporating spectrum slicing enables flexible extraction of parallel chaotic channels with preserved statistical independence and per-channel programmability. As a result, we demonstrate a single-channel ultra-broadband optical chaos with an effective bandwidth of 543.8 GHz, and a broadband terahertz noise source with an excess noise ratio of 52.99 \\pm 2.85 dB to validate its flatness. Furthermore, we employ the uncorrelated parallel chaos for ultrafast photonic decision-making in a 256-armed bandit problem, achieving a favourable power-law scaling exponent of 0.86.

The effects of particle diameter, charge rate, and pre-existing notches on the failure behaviour of Si particles were systematically analysed. The results showed that the increase in charge rate, particle diameter, and pre-existing notch length leads to larger cracking rates and faster fracturing of the particle. Then, a validated contour map of Si particle's fracture behaviours was developed. Additionally, the influence of pre-existing notch length and charge rate on fatigue damage was examined, and it was found that longer pre-existing notch length and larger charge rate can shorten the particle's cyclic life. Finally, to alleviate the particle fracture, nanopores were introduced in the particle, and the influence of porosity on the fracture behaviours was investigated. The results showed that nanopores can reduce expansion, dissipate global tensile stresses and elongate the crack propagation path. The developed computational framework established a predictive relationship between stress diffusion coupling theory and particle-level degradation, guiding future design and manufacturing of failure-resistant Si-based anodes for lithium-ion batteries.

We analyze the problem of the coupling between classical electromagnetic fields in a cavity and a movable mirror, considering both nonrelativistic and relativistic regimes of motion. Starting from the equations of motion for a mirror subject to a generic external potential, we provide a variational formulation of the mirror-radiation interaction. Within this framework, a single-mode variational approximation is introduced, which captures the essential dynamical features of the coupled system. In the special case of a mirror undergoing free motion, the variational method yields an exact solution.

Here, we realize tunable lateral optical force entirely within a fluid environment by using Janus particles: dielectric microspheres half-coated with gold. We show that the lateral optical force arises from scattering asymmetry induced by the asymmetric structure of the particles; it can be tuned by adjusting the polarization angle of a linearly polarized beam, but also particle parameters including their size and orientation. Experimentally, we directly observe fully reversible lateral propulsion of Janus particles in water merely by rotating the polarization direction, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.

    "abstract": "           The mean free path of photocarriers is a crucial parameter for material design, device optimization, and new optoelectronics applications. Currently, this parameter remains unknown for many materials, and experimental means available for its measurement are considerably lacking. Meanwhile, it remains an unclear issue whether the mean free path of the photogenerated high-energy hot carriers is significantly different from that of the localequilibrium-state carriers near the Fermi surface or around the band edge. Based on the concept of transient grating Fourier transform and utilizing a virtual lock-in amplification technique, we proposed and demonstrated an efficient experimental technique for measuring the mean free path of photocarriers. This method has facilitated direct observation of the photocarrier transport behavior across the transition between diffusive and ballistic motion, from which we surprisingly find that the mean free path of photogenerated hot carriers in Silicon membrane and GaAs quantum well can reach micron scale, more than an order of magnitude larger compared to the electrically-measured one. This work provides new ideas for characterization of photoelectronic devices under operating status and is expected to greatly enhance the understanding of the photocarrier transport process in opto-electronic or photonic materials.

    "abstract": "           Semiconducting Barrier Discharges (SeBDs) generate uniform ionization waves in air at atmospheric pressure. In this work, we investigate how externally applied irradiation synchronized with the discharge can mimic photoconductive-type coupling between the plasma and the semiconductor surface. By illuminating the Si-SiO$_2$ interface with nanosecond pulsed irradiation at wavelengths from 532 nm to 1064 nm, and using fast imaging, optical emission spectroscopy, and current-voltage measurements, we demonstrate that the photoexcitation of charge carriers in silicon enhances the plasma emission and increases the reduced electric field, with no detectable change in the electrical energy. The magnitude and thresholds of these responses depend on wavelength. By comparing the SeBD to a MOS photodetector, this behaviour can be explained by the absorption length. This length determines whether carriers are photogenerated inside the depletion region at the SiO$_2$-Si interface, where they are efficiently separated and undergo impact-ionization amplification, or deeper in the silicon bulk where carrier separation is weaker and free-carrier absorption diminishes the quantum efficiency. These results focus on the microscopic processes governing the plasma-semiconductor coupling and demonstrate how the optoelectronic properties of silicon can influence surface ionization waves.

The comparable benchmarks are the archetype anti-\\ce{B18H22} denoted as (1) against hypothetical halogenated derivatives: 7-F-anti-\\ce{B18H21} (2), 4-F-anti-\\ce{B18H21} (3), and the recently synthesized 4-Br-anti-\\ce{B18H21} (4). The analysis includes an optimization of the ground and first singlet excited states, vibrational frequency analysis, and a comprehensive spectroscopic profile covering IR, Raman, UV-Vis absorption, and emission spectra. The IR spectra of the fluorinated compounds feature a characteristic B-F stretching peak, while the Raman spectra closely resemble the parent molecule. UV-Vis spectral analysis shows a redshift and oscillator strength enhancement for F at position B7, indicating altered electronic properties due to substitution with lighter halogen. Furthermore, solvent effects enhance the probability of electronic transitions. Halogene presence led to a decrease of the energy gap EG(LUMO-HOMO) due to the stabilization of LUMO, which implied a redshift in the emission/absorption wavelength spectra, with the largest EG change at around 14\\% occurring for the (4)$^{th}$ benchmark compound.. Notably, all compounds emit light within the visible spectrum, underscoring their potential for optoelectronic applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           This study presents a detailed quantum chemical investigation of the electronic and excited-state properties of syn- and anti-isomers of the borane cluster B18H22 and their sulfur-doped derivatives. Using the PB86/def2-SVP level of theory with dispersion corrections, the research examines how sulfur substitution and non-covalent interactions influence cluster stability, electronic structure, spectra, and optoelectronic potential. Comparative analysis of the syn- and anti-isomers reveals the impact of molecular conformation on frontier molecular orbitals and related energetic and photophysical properties. Sulfur doping is shown to enhance charge delocalization, stabilize excited states, and improve thermal stability, which form key factors for tunable laser applications. The inclusion of advanced dispersion correction methods proves essential for accurately capturing many-body interactions that govern electronic behavior. By elucidating the interplay between structural features, substitution patterns, and computational modeling, the work provides valuable insights into structure-property relationships critical for designing borane-based materials with tailored optoelectronic and thermal characteristics. In addition to doping and dispersion effects, functionals' effects were examined through comparison amidst various ones with different asymptotic exchange on excitation and gap energies. In summary, the computational methodology combined good DFT/Basis/dispersion set to accurately predict geometries, IR/UV spectra, NMR chemical shifts, dipole moments, polarizability and excited-state properties, thereby offering a comprehensive theoretical understanding of syn-, anti- isomers of B18H22 and its sulfur doped variants.

By solving the Bloch equations in the stationary, quasi-stationary, and short-pulse regimes, we obtained closed-form expressions for the atomic populations and coherences and identified a bifurcation in the oscillatory dynamics at zero longitudinal Zeeman splitting. The Fourier-domain analysis reveals alternating transparency/absorption and normal/anomalous dispersion with frequency-dependent sign reversals, enabling spectrally selective filtering and group-delay effects. Slow oscillatory behavior in the radio-frequency range makes the system suitable for weak magnetic-field sensing, while fast oscillations at optical frequencies suggest applications in spectral filtering and frequency-comb-like signal shaping.

Yet, their efficient generation at high average power remains limited by thermal effects, phase-matching constraints, and material damage. Here, we demonstrate broadband THz and UV generation driven by a common Yb:KGW laser operating from at 40 - 600 kHz. THz radiation is produced by optical rectification in stoichiometric MgO:LiNbO$_3$ using a line-focus geometry, yielding single-cycle pulses of 55 - 92 nJ energy with peak electric fields of 37 - 90 kV/cm. Electro-optic sampling and beam-quality measurements reveal tunable control between central frequency, bandwidth and field amplitude by translating the generation region transversely within the crystal. Using shorter pump pulses preserves THz conversion efficiency, while longer pulses at 100 kHz reduce THz output by up to a factor of four due to cumulative thermal effects. Femtosecond 257.5 nm UV pulses are generated by cascaded fourth-harmonic generation in $\\beta$-barium borate with conversion efficiencies exceeding 10% at 40 kHz and stable operation up to 600 kHz. These results demonstrate a compact, thermally robust platform for high-average-power nonlinear conversion and are directly relevant to next-generation high-repetition-rate ultrafast electron diffraction and spectroscopy systems.

In this article we advocate the statistical contextual interpretation which is free of paradoxes. State vectors and various operators are purely mathematical entities allowing making quantitative probabilistic predictions. State vector describes an ensemble of identically prepared physical systems and a specific operator represents a class of equivalent measurements of a physical observable. A collapse of wave function is not a mysterious and instantaneous physical process. A collapsed quantum state describes a new ensemble of physical systems prepared in a particular way. Probabilities are objective properties of random experiments in which empirical frequencies stabilize. Therefore, quantum probabilities do not provide a complete description of individual physical systems and their interactions. Whether these probabilities can be explained as emergent is an open question which cannot be settled by philosophical discussions and no-go theorems. It can be only answered by more detailed study of experimental data then it is usually done. Bell Tests allowed rejecting Bell local and Bell causal hidden variable models but we even don't know whether quantum probabilities provide a complete description of existing experimental data. Time series of experimental data may contain much more information than it is obtained using empirical frequencies and histograms. Therefore, predictable completeness of quantum mechanics has be tested and not taken for granted.         ",

The nonlinear interactions between solitons make multi-soliton pumping generally lack the robustness characteristic of Thouless pumping as linear systems.

    "abstract": "           The variational optimization of high-dimensional neural network models, such as those used in neural quantum states (NQS), presents a significant challenge in machine intelligence. Conventional first-order stochastic methods (e.g., Adam) are plagued by slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and numerical instability, preventing NQS from reaching the high accuracy required for fundamental science. We address this fundamental optimization bottleneck by introducing the implicitly restarted Lanczos (IRL) method as the core engine for NQS training. Our key innovation is an inherently stable second-order optimization framework that recasts the ill-conditioned parameter update problem into a small, well-posed Hermitian eigenvalue problem. By solving this problem efficiently and robustly with IRL, our approach automatically determines the optimal descent direction and step size, circumventing the need for demanding hyperparameter tuning and eliminating the numerical instabilities common in standard iterative solvers. We demonstrate that IRL enables shallow NQS architectures (with orders of magnitude fewer parameters) to consistently achieve extreme precision (1e-12 kcal/mol) in just 3 to 5 optimization steps. For the F2 molecule, this translates to an approximate 17,900-fold speed-up in total runtime compared to Adam. This work establishes IRL as a superior, robust, and efficient second-order optimization strategy for variational quantum models, paving the way for the practical, high-fidelity application of neural networks in quantum physics and chemistry.

In this work, we show that squeezed highly elliptically polarized drivers not only enable the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process in classically forbidden regimes of large ellipticity, but also yield highly elliptical harmonic radiation with pronounced super-Poissonian photon statistics. Moreover, we show that the HHG spectral features encode information about the quantum nature of the driving field, revealing the presence of its squeezed field fluctuations. By analyzing the HHG spectral intensity dependence as a function of the driver's ellipticity and squeezing orientation, we identify a means to probe the driving field's quantum properties that intrinsically lie in the high-photon number regime.

This, together with the unprecedented longevity of trapped ions, opens an avenue for the exploration of phenomena that take place on long timescales, e.g., slow and collective relaxation in frustrated and kinetically constrained systems. Our platform makes use of the strong dipolar interactions among electronic Rydberg states and planar confinement provided by a Penning trap. We investigate how the strong electric and magnetic fields that form this trap affect the properties of the Rydberg states and show that spin-spin interaction strengths on the order of MHz are achievable under experimentally realistic conditions.

However, free electrons generally only absorb/emit one photon at a time, while the physical mechanism and phenomena of free electron-two-photon interaction have not been studied yet. Moreover, the relationship between PINEM and Kapitza-Dirac (KD) effect and nonlinear Compton scattering is still unclear. Here we develop the full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction considering the two-photon process. It is revealed that the emission/absorption of two photons by electrons can be greatly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of optical near field, and the quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes can occur in some circumstances, which affects the photon number state, electron energy states and electron-photon entanglement. Meanwhile, it is found that the KD effect (elastic electron-photon scattering) and nonlinear Compton scattering (inelastic electron-photon scattering) are also a kind of two-photon process and the distribution of electrons can be deduced analytically based on the full quantum theory.

    "abstract": "           The light deflection under a strong gravitational field, referred to as strong gravitational lensing, provides a powerful probe of spacetime geometry. Besides, laboratory analogue models are employed to study the effects of curved spacetime and explore the design of optical devices. Here, applying the framework of analogue gravity, we reveal the behavior of the optical echo from a pulsed point-like source near a black hole, which is strongly dependent on the interplay of the black hole's photon sphere and the source's duration. We model the Schwarzschild spacetime as a Flamm paraboloid and calculate the echo response, using analytical geodesic solutions and the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Particularly, when the spatial scale of pulse duration is comparable to the photon sphere, continuous ``echo tails\" appear along bright interference fringes in temporal response. Analysis in both the temporal and frequency domains reveals that these echo tails are a signature of resonance between the incoming pulse and the photon sphere. This work provides a wave-optics perspective on the interaction between dynamic sources and black holes, offering a table top window on strong gravitational lensing.         ",

Our model includes Rabi oscillations, photoionization, Auger decay, and quantum interference among elastic scattering and resonance fluorescence pathways. We analyze how the total scattering signal depends on pulse intensity, atomic configuration, and initial electronic state. We find that the total resonant scattering yield exceeds its non-resonant counterpart; the angular dependence of the signal qualitatively resembles a two-atom structure factor; and the visibility of interference fringes is sensitive to pulse area and the initial electronic state. Only a subset of final states reached via resonance fluorescence exhibits interference, determined by the indistinguishability of photon emission pathways. Fringe visibility is maximized in the linear scattering regime, where ionization is minimal and resonance fluorescence pathways can be largely indistinguishable. These results highlight optimal conditions for applying ultrafast resonant x-ray scattering to single-particle imaging.         ",

Optical transmission through the PBG at specific frequencies occurs by defect-mediated optical tunneling. Biofluid flows perpendicular to light propagation, through a channel containing the PC, defined by silica side-walls and an underlying silica substrate. Replacing the silicon blocks with thin silicon strips throughout the domain-wall region, analyte binding coincides with regions of maximal field intensity. As a result, the sensitivity is improved by almost 16 times higher than the previous designs. We analyze optical mode hybridization of two nearby domain walls and its close relation to the transmission-levels and correlations in frequency shifts of nearby optical resonances in response to analyte-bindings. We illustrate three high-sensitivity chips each with three domain-wall defects, all of which can distinguish three analyte-bindings and their combinations completely in a single spectroscopic measurement. In a photonic crystal, consisting of silicon squares embedded in a water background and a 5-micron lattice spacing, the biosensor sensitivity to a thin analyte binding layer is nearly 3000 nm/RIU, and to the overall background biofluid is over 8000 nm/RIU.

However, such high-dimensional dynamic PDE-constrained optimization problems are extremely challenging or even intractable. It has been recently shown that inverse problems can be solved by only considering certain robust features. Here we consider the ICF capsule's deuterium-tritium (DT) interface, and construct a causal, dynamic, multifidelity reduced-order surrogate that maps from a time-dependent radiation temperature drive to the interface's radius and velocity dynamics. The surrogate targets an ODE embedding of DT interface dynamics, and is constructed by learning a controller for a base analytical model using low- and high-fidelity simulation training data with respect to radiation energy group structure. After demonstrating excellent accuracy of the surrogate interface model, we use machine learning (ML) models with surrogate-generated data to solve inverse problems optimizing radiation temperature drive to reproduce observed interface dynamics. For sparse snapshots in time, the ML model further characterizes the most informative times at which to sample dynamics. Altogether we demonstrate how operator learning, causal architectures, and physical inductive bias can be integrated to accelerate discovery, design, and diagnostics in high-energy-density systems.

We aim to quantify $T_{1D}$ using spin-lock MRI technique. Methods: In the proposed method, we introduce a $T_{1D}$-specific ratio, denoted as $RATIO_{dosl}$. This ratio is derived from the distinct relaxation rate $R_{dosl}$, calculated as the difference between dual-frequency relaxation $R_{1\\rho}^{dual}$ and single-frequency $R_{1\\rho}^{single}$ relaxation measurements. A novel rotary-echo spin-lock sequence was developed to enable dual-frequency spin-lock acquisition. We established a framework to estimate $T_{1D}$, as well as the macromolecular pool fraction (MPF) map. The proposed approach was validated via numerical simulations, phantom studies, and demonstrated in vivo in human white matter. Results: Simulations revealed the high sensitivity of $RATIO_{dosl}$ to $T_{1D}$, and substantiated the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methods. Phantom experiments demonstrated robust ihMT contrast and confirmed the capability of $T_{1D}$ quantification via $RATIO_{dosl}$. In vivo studies supported the clinical viability of this approcah, achieving simultaneous $T_{1D}$ and MPF mapping using only three spin-lock prepared images. Across ten healthy volunteers, the mean white matter $T_{1D}$ ranged from approximately 3.70 to 4.80 ms. Conclustion: We propose a novel method for $T_{1D}$ quantification based on spin-lock MRI. By requiring only three contrast-prepared images, this technique provides a promising pathway for robust, rapid, and simultaneous $T_{1D}$ and MPF quantification with fewer confounds         ",

In addition, a repetitive acquisition protocol was designed to visualize intra-tissue activities (i.e., dynamic OCT imaging).

In addition to non-volatile color tuning by PCMs, thermally induced crystallization may alter the optical properties of ITO layers as well. But the potential change in color of the ITO layers is not considered so far. In this work, we investigate the structural and optical properties of ITO thin film films via X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements. After thermal annealing at 250 \u00b0C, the ITO thin films of 15-100 nm get crystallized with strong changes in refractive index n and extinction coefficient k in the visible light range. However, for the 5-nm ITO thin film, crystallization is only observed after thermal annealing at 350 \u00b0C and the change in color is limited upon phase transition. We provide a colormap of the ITO/platinum/silicon structure in terms of the annealing temperature (150-350 \u00b0C) and ITO film thickness (5-100 nm). Our work suggests that the intrinsic change in colors of ITO layers should also be considered for the PCM-based reconfigurable display application.         ",

This state-dependent ancillary system is not pre-engineered to match the quantum state to be cloned; rather, it dynamically aligns with the quantum state to be cloned via interaction. However, the space of states that it can clone is restricted by the symmetry principles. This process, while resembling quantum cloning, adheres to the no-cloning theorem due to its state-dependent and non-universal nature. We demonstrate that stimulated emission offers a concrete physical realization of state-dependent quantum copying via an adaptive ancilla. We explore how a quantum state, for instance, a photon polarization, can be cloned through light-matter interactions when the ancillary system, such as an excited atom, contains implicit structural information about the quantum state in the form of a structured set of dynamical response channels. We reinterpret the excited atomic state as a realization of an adaptive ancilla, and cloning of a photon polarization state occurs when the quantum state of an excited atom dynamically aligns with the polarization state of the photon through physical interaction. We demonstrate that the true limits of cloning arise solely not from the no-cloning theorem, but from the symmetries imposed on physical systems\\textthreequartersemdash constraints which may, in principle, be relaxed or engineered in suitable quantum systems, for instance in Rydberg atoms.
