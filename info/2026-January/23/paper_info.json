    "abstract": "           We show that the bipartite separability of a pure qubit state hinges critically on the combinatorial structure of its computational-basis support. Using Boolean cube geometry, we introduce a taxonomy that distinguishes support-guaranteed separability from cases in which entanglement depends on probability amplitudes. We provide closed-form support counts, identify forbidden configurations that enforce multipartite entanglement, and show how these results can enable fast entanglement diagnostics in quantum circuits. The framework offers immediate utility in classical simulation, entanglement-aware circuit design, and quantum error-correcting code analysis. This establishes support geometry as a practical and scalable tool for understanding entanglement in quantum information processing.         ",

    "abstract": "           Millimeter-wave oscillators underpin key applications in communication, spectroscopy, radar, and astronomy, yet their achievable spectral purity remains limited. Approaches that directly generate millimeter-wave carriers are fundamentally limited by quantum and thermal phase-noise processes. Here we show that these limits can be overcome by combining Kerr-induced optical frequency division in a chip-scale microresonator with a large-spacing dual-wavelength Brillouin laser. This 3.3 THz optical reference injection-locks a Kerr soliton microcomb, with a repetition rate that becomes a coherently divided 300 GHz carrier with phase noise below the quantum limit of a corresponding 300 GHz dual-wavelength Brillouin laser and far below the thermo-refractive noise of a microring resonator. Cross-correlation phase-noise measurements were developed to show that the resulting oscillator reaches a phase-noise floor of -152 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, consistent with photodetection shot noise. Integration of the measured spectrum yields an RMS timing jitter of 135 as from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. These results establish optical frequency division as a generic method for generation of sub-terahertz carriers with coherence no longer constrained by direct-generation limits.         ",

    "abstract": "           Ultrafast laser welding provides a promising approach for high precision integration of transparent and metallic materials. However, its practical application remains constrained by the precise regulation of the interfacial gap. This study investigates the interfacial response and bonding mechanism of sapphire and Fe-36Ni alloy joints under controlled non-optical contact conditions using burst mode ultrafast laser irradiation. A polymer interlayer was introduced between naturally stacked samples to establish a variable interfacial gap, allowing systematic evaluation of gap-dependent morphology, melting behavior, and elemental transport. By redistributing the pulse energy into sequential sub-pulses, the burst mode reconstructs the temporal energy-deposition process, yielding enhanced plasma-material coupling and stable thermal accumulation. Compared with single pulse irradiation, burst mode sustains continuous bonding across gaps exceeding 10 um--far beyond the failure threshold of the single pulse mode--and forms a fusion zone 82% larger. Fracture surface and cross-sectional analyses of SEM and EDS results confirm that sequential sub-pulses promote extensive sapphire melting, droplet-driven gap bridging, and enhanced Al-Fe interdiffusion at the interface. These results provide a scientific basis for high-gap-tolerance ultrafast laser welding and scalable integration of transparent-metal hybrid components in advanced optoelectronic and precision engineering applications.

Two distinct operational schemes are analyzed. A single frequency scheme employs cascaded second harmonic generation and inverse second harmonic generation (SHG/iSHG) using two Type-I SHG interactions, whereas a dual frequency scheme employs cascaded SHG and optical parametric amplification (SHG/OPA). Exact theoretical solutions and numerical calculations show cascadable amplification and digital on/off switching. A new optical phenomenon of nonlinear transparency is predicted by the theoretical solutions and confirmed by the numerical solutions in each scheme of the cascaded SHG/iSHG and SHG/OPA. The single and dual frequency configurations satisfy the cascadability and fan-out criteria with power transfer ratios of 4.838 and 52.26 and power amplification factors of 48.38 and 522.6, respectively.

    "abstract": "           Modulation and control of lasers and optical signals is necessary for trapped-ion and cold neutral atom quantum systems. Given the diversity of atomic species, experimental modalities, and architectures, integrated optical modulators designed to operate across the visible to near-infrared spectrum are a key step towards portable, robust, and compact quantum computers, clocks, and sensors. Integrated optical modulators that are wavelength-independent, CMOS-compatible, and capable of maintaining low waveguide losses and a high resonator quality factor, DC-coupled broadband frequency response, and low power consumption, are essential for scalable photonic integration. Yet progress towards these goals has remained limited. Here we demonstrate four types of integrated stress-optic lead zirconate titanate (PZT) silicon nitride modulators: a coil Mach-Zehnder modulator, a coil pure phase modulator, and bus-coupled and add-drop ring resonator modulators, with operation from 493 nm to 780 nm. The coil MZM operates at 532 nm with a V${\\pi}$ of 2.8V, a 0.4 MHz 3-dB bandwidth, and an extinction ratio of 21.5dB. The coil phase modulator operates at 493 nm with a V${\\pi}$ of 2.8V and low residual amplitude modulation of -34 dB at a 1kHz offset. The bus-coupled ring resonator modulator operates at 493 nm and the add-drop ring resonator modulator operates at 780 nm. The ring-based modulators have an intrinsic quality factor of 3.4 million and 1.9 million, a linear tuning strength of 0.9 GHz/V and 1 GHz/V, and a 3-dB bandwidth of 2.6 MHz and 10 MHz, respectively. All four modulator designs maintain the low optical waveguide loss of SiN, are DC coupled with broadband frequency response, operate independent of wavelength, and consume only tens of nW per actuator. Such solutions unlock the potential for further integration with other precision SiN components to realize chip-scale atomic and quantum systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Lithium niobate sees widespread use in nonlinear and quantum optical devices, such as for sum- and difference-frequency generation or spontaneous parametric down-conversion. In lithium niobate waveguides, nonlinear optical processes are often limited by the so-called photorefractive effect, which limits the maximum input or output powers and impacts the nonlinear spectral response. Therefore, strategies for the management of photorefractive damage are a key consideration in device design. Usually, the photorefractive damage threshold, i.e. the maximal permissible operating power, can be increased by high temperature operation of devices. This approach, however, is not applicable in cryogenic environments, which may be required for specialized applications. To better understand the impact of photorefraction in nonlinear optical applications, we study the impact of photorefraction on the phase-matching spectra of two nonlinear-optical sum-frequency generation experiments at 1) high temperatures and 2) cryogenic temperatures. Furthermore, we present an approach to reduce the impact of photorefraction which is compatible with cryogenic operation. This comprises an auxiliary light source, propagating in the same waveguide, which is used to restore phase-matching spectra impacted by photorefraction, as well as reduce pyroelectric effects. Our work provides an alternative route to photorefraction management applicable to cryogenic environments, as well as in situations with tight energy budgets like space applications.         ",

We show that, with phase stabilization active, the interferometer is able to recover both first-order and second-order photon correlations.

In 2015, Mundarain and Ladr\u00f3n de Guevara [Quantum Inf. Process. 14, 4493 (2015)] introduced local-available quantum correlations (LAQC), which are a promising yet understudied quantum correlation. Recently, Bellorin et al. [Int. J. Mod. Phys.

Building up from those results, we analyzed the LAQC swapping for 2-qubit X states. As expected, we find that if the initial states are non-classical and the one used for the projective measurement is entangled, the final state will generally have non-zero LAQC. Using the properties of this quantum correlation, we establish the conditions for a QCS scheme that leads to a final state with a non-zero LAQC measure. We illustrate these results by analyzing five families of one-parameter 2-qubit X states, including families where the projective measure leads to a separable state, but whose LAQC measure is non-zero.

As such, it represents a problem for which such a device may provide some practical advantage over traditional computing methods. In order to understand the extent to which such problems may indeed provide examples of useful quantum advantage, it is important to understand the limitations of existing classical simulation methods. In this work, we benchmark our own classical solver designed to study such problems. This solver uses a clustering approximation to achieve a resource scaling which is linear in the total number of nuclear spins in a given molecule, for a fixed cluster size. The success of such an approximation would present a stark repudiation to the common claim that such problems require an exponential scaling of resources, the very claim which makes simulating an NMR spectra a candidate for quantum advantage. Our benchmarking results indicate that our approximation performs well throughout, and even somewhat beyond, the more typical experimental regimes. We discuss what implications this may have for future efforts to demonstrate quantum advantage in the context of NMR.         ",

We develop a suite of methods to perform matrix arithmetics -- with the result encoded in the off-diagonal blocks of a Hamiltonian -- using Hamiltonian evolutions of input operators. We show how to maintain this $\\textit{Hamiltonian block encoding}$, so that matrix operations can be composed one after another, and the entire quantum computation takes $\\leq 2$ ancilla qubits. We achieve this for matrix multiplication, matrix addition, matrix inversion, Hermitian conjugation, fractional scaling, integer scaling, complex phase scaling, as well as singular value transformation for both odd and even polynomials. We also present an overlap estimation algorithm to extract classical properties of Hamiltonian block encoded operators, analogous to the well known Hadmard test, at no extra cost of qubit. Our Hamiltonian matrix multiplication uses the Lie group commutator product formula and its higher-order generalizations due to Childs and Wiebe. Our Hamiltonian singular value transformation employs a dominated polynomial approximation, where the approximation holds within the domain of interest, while the constructed polynomial is upper bounded by the target function over the entire unit interval. We describe a circuit for simulating a class of sum-of-squares Hamiltonians, attaining a commutator scaling in step count, while leveraging the power of matrix arithmetics to reduce the cost of each simulation step. In particular, we apply this to the doubly factorized tensor hypercontracted Hamiltonians from recent studies of quantum chemistry, obtaining further improvements for initial states with a fixed number of particles.

    "title": "Calibration Method of Spacecraft-Inertial Sensor Center-of-Mass Offset for the Taiji Gravitational Wave Detection Mission under Science Mode",
    "abstract": "           Accurately calibrating the center-of-mass (CoM) offset between the spacecraft (SC) and the inertial sensor test mass (TM) is crucial for space-based gravitational-wave (GW) antennas, such as LISA and Taiji. Current calibration methods require additional spacecraft maneuvers that disrupt science data continuity and inter-satellite links, compromising the coherence of gravitational wave signals. Here, we present a maneuver-free calibration scheme that directly estimates the CoM offset vector using only standard science-mode measurements from inertial sensors, interferometers, and differential wavefront sensors. By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis. For LISA-like missions, where data continuity is paramount for detecting faint gravitational wave signals, this method will enhance scientific output and reliability.         ",
