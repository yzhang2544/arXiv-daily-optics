    "title": "On-Axis Optical Trapping with Vortex Beams: The Role of the Multipolar Decomposition",
    "abstract": "           Optical trapping is a well_established, decades old technology with applications in several fields of research. The most common scenario deals with particles that tend to be centered on the brightest part of the optical trap. Consequently, the optical forces keep the particle away from the dark zones of the beam. However, this is not the case when a focused doughnut_shaped beam generates on_axis trapping. In this system, the particle is centered on the intensity minima of the laser beam and the bright annular part lies on the periphery of the particle. Researchers have shown great interest in this phenomenon due to its advantage of reducing light interaction with trapped particles and the intriguing increase in the trapping strength. This work presents experimental and theoretical results that extend the analysis of on_axis trapping with light vortex beams. Specifically, in our experiments, we trap micron_sized spherical silica (SiO2) particles in water and we measure, through the power spectrum density method, the trap stiffness constant \\k{appa} generated by vortex beams with different topological charge orders. The optical forces are calculated from the exact solutions of the electromagnetic fields provided by the generalized Lorentz_Mie theory. We show a remarkable agreement between the theoretical prediction and the experimental measurements of \\k{appa}. Moreover, our numerical model gives us information about the electromagnetic fields inside the particle, offering valuable insights into the influence of the electromagnetic fields present in the vortex beam trapping scenario.

    "abstract": "           Flat-band states in topological systems provide a unique platform for investigating strongly correlated phenomena and many body physics. However, in 2D static tight-binding systems, perfectly flat bands can only exist in the topologically trivial phase, as characterized by a zero Chern number. Here we show that by introducing periodic driving into a 2D photonic Lieb lattice composed of coupled microring resonators, the resulting Floquet topological insulator can host perfectly flat bands with nontrivial topology. In particular, by tracking the evolution of the flat-band modes over each cycle, we show that the non-Abelian displacements of the flat-band modes are characterized by a nontrivial quantized helicity even though the quasi-energy bands have zero Chern number. The helical motion of the flat-band modes can be described by a braiding of the world lines of their trajectories, with a nontrivial winding number directly connected to the helicity. We also propose a scheme to experimentally measure the quantized non-Abelian helicity in a microring lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. These results suggest that Floquet topological photonic insulators based on coupled microring resonators can provide a versatile platform for investigating non-Abelian topological physics and strongly correlated phenomena in photonic flat-band systems.

We implement dual-tone heterodyne detection, achieving a minimum detectable field strength on the order of uV/cm and a sensitivity in the sub-uV/cm/Hz^1/2 regime, while extending the operational bandwidth up to 3 GHz. Through systematic characterization of frequency and power dependencies, we identify optimal operating conditions to minimize power broadening in the resonant AT regime and maximize sensitivity in the far-off-resonance AC Stark regime. The resulting platform combines high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, and a dynamic range of approximately 90 dB, establishing Rydberg atoms as practical sensors for precision electric field metrology.

    "abstract": "           Spontaneous emission, as a fundamental radiative process and a versatile information carrier, plays a vital role in light-emitting devices, optical information modulation and encryption, super-resolution fluorescence imaging and nano sensing. Engineering the photonic environment surrounding quantum emitters can enhance their emission characteristics. However, simultaneously achieving precise control over both excitation enhancement and quantum-yield modulation at the nanoscale remains elusive, highlighting substantial room for advancing the precised engineering of quantum emission. Here, we introduce silicon Mie voids - air-defined cavities that invert the conventional solid-particle geometry - to achieve independent tuning of quantum emission within an individual subwavelength structure, while minimizing optical losses. Full-wave simulations and experiments on both gradient and uniform Mie-void arrays jointly validate this quantitative framework for emission tuning, which disentangles excitation enhancement arising from local field confinement in air and quantum-yield enhancement resulting from strengthened emitter-resonator coupling, while confirming the accelerated radiative decay enabled by the void configuration. Leveraging this flexible mechanism, we realize a bimodal nanophotonic pattern with near-diffraction-limited pixels that encode the EPFL logo in the bright field and the SJTU logo in both dark field and photoluminescence micrographs. These results establish Mie voids as a powerful platform for programmable, high-density multimodal displays and open new avenues for advancing state-of-the-art nanophotonic devices.         ",

To achieve the desired effect, each individual laser pulse must be delivered correctly. Laser Shock Peening quality is typically verified by destructive and time-consuming residual stress measurements or by subjective operator judgement, which is non-objective and unsuitable for continuous in-line control. We propose a simple, low-cost and robust method based on the analysis of the acoustic response that automatically classifies individual laser pulses as defect-free or defective. We show that the acoustic response captured by a low-cost microphone carries sufficiently informative signatures to reliably distinguish correct from incorrect impacts and enables quality control at the level of single pulses. The method provides a non-destructive and objective route to real-time monitoring of Laser Shock Peening, with the potential to increase process reliability and support industrial deployment of this technology without the need for subsequent destructive measurements.

In large gas lasers, however, the frequency spacing between longitudinal modes of the resonator easily becomes significantly smaller than the Doppler-broadened width of the gain profile. As a consequence, the laser might operate on a multitude of modes simultaneously, or jump between modes. Such unstable operation cannot be tolerated in metrological or sensing applications, such as ring laser gyroscopes. Here, we propose and demonstrate a method to establish stable operation on a chosen mode index by optically steering the ring laser to a desired mode index through injection locking with an external laser. The injected mode reliably follows the external steering. Intra-cavity backscattering can even cause the counter-propagating, non-injected mode to follow the external steering as well.         ",

    "abstract": "           Relativistic spin effects drive subtle molecular phenomena ranging from intersystem crossing in photodynamic therapy to spin-mediated catalysis and high-resolution spectroscopy. These effects are described by the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian, which extends the nonrelativistic electronic Hamiltonian by including one- and two-electron spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions. First-principles simulations of the full Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian rapidly become intractable on classical computers due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the complexity of two-body spin-dependent terms. We propose a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for computing molecular energy levels and properties governed by the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian. Our approach block-encodes the relativistic Hamiltonian in a second-quantized, doubly factorized representation. By reformulating the Hamiltonian in a symmetry-adapted Majorana basis, we construct efficient linear-combination-of-unitaries circuits that encode spin-orbit interactions without effective or mean-field approximations. We introduce spin-controlled Pauli-SWAP networks that decouple spin and orbital control logic, enabling a unified treatment of relativistic spin mixing with only modest overhead relative to spin-free simulations. We analyze quantum resources in terms of logical qubits and T-gate complexity, showing that explicit spin degrees of freedom do not worsen the asymptotic scaling. The prefactor is reduced by a factor of two compared to direct linear-combination-of-unitaries approaches. Finally, we outline a hybrid quantum-classical workflow for designing photodynamic therapy photosensitizers, artificial photosynthesis catalysts, and other systems where accurate relativistic spin effects are essential.

Due to the limitations of the involved elements, however, near-100\\% transmissions were reported under highly demanding experimental conditions for atomic and other media. Based on a structure of three linearly coupled optical resonators, an active one carrying a possibly arbitrary optical gain and two passive ones simply with dissipation, we demonstrate that a transmitted light field can become completely transparent through the structure, which displays all properties similar to those of EIT. Manifested by a destructive interference to annihilate the intracavity field in the resonator directly coupled to the input, this complete transparency exists for any feasible power of the transmitted field and all realizable coupling strengths of the dark resonator with the input and the neighboring resonator, as long as the inter-cavity coupling for two other resonators is adjustable over a suitable range. A free control on the transparency window size and output field intensity can be realized by tuning two inter-cavity couplings without modifying the built-in system parameters.         ",

Yet, no experiments have been reported to date. Here, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence g(2)({\\tau}) quantum light spectroscopy (SMFg2-QLS) that can simultaneously measure the fluorescence intensity, lifetime, spectra, and g(2)({\\tau}) with frequency resolution, for a single molecule in a controlled environment at both room temperature and cryogenic temperature.

We have observed different g(2)({\\tau}=0) values with different bands or bandwidths of the single molecule IDTBT fluorescence. The general features are consistent with theoretical predictions and suggest non-trivial excited state quantum dynamics, possibly showing quantum coherence, although further analysis and confirmation will require additional theoretical calculations that take into account the complexity and inhomogeneity of individual IDTBT single molecular chains.

    "abstract": "           Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been applied to inverse scattering problems (ISPs) due to their strong nonlinear mapping capabilities. However, supervised DNN solvers require large-scale datasets, which limits their generalization in practical applications. Untrained neural networks (UNNs) address this issue by updating weights from measured electric fields and prior physical knowledge, but existing UNN solvers suffer from long inference time. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a contrast-source-based physics-driven neural network (CSPDNN), which predicts the induced current distribution to improve efficiency and incorporates an adaptive total variation loss for robust reconstruction under varying contrast and noise conditions. The improved imaging performance is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and experimental data.         ",

    "abstract": "           Purpose: To simulate effective transverse relaxation ($T_2^*$) as a part of MR simulation. $T_2^*$ consists of reversible ($T_2^{\\prime}$) and irreversible ($T_2$) components. Whereas simulations of $T_2$ are easy, $T_2^{\\prime}$ is not easily simulated if only magnetizations of individual isochromats are simulated. Theory and Methods: Efficient methods for simulating $T_2^{\\prime}$ were proposed. To approximate the Lorentzian function of $T_2^{\\prime}$ realistically, conventional simulators require 100+ isochromats. This approximation can be avoided by utilizing a linear phase model for simulating an entire Lorentzian function directly. To represent the linear phase model, the partial derivatives of the magnetizations with respect to the frequency axis were also simulated. To accelerate the simulations with these partial derivatives, the proposed methods introduced two techniques: analytic solutions, and combined transitions. For understanding the fundamental mechanism of the proposed method, a simple one-isochromat simulation was performed. For evaluating realistic cases, several pulse sequences were simulated using two phantoms with and without $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations. Results: The one-isochromat simulation demonstrated that $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations were possible. In the realistic cases, $T_2^{\\prime}$ was recovered as expected without using 100+ isochromats for each point. The computational times with $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations were only 2.0 to 2.7 times longer than those without $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations. When the above-mentioned two techniques were utilized, the analytic solutions accelerated 19 times, and the combined transitions accelerated up to 17 times. Conclusion: Both theory and results showed that the proposed methods simulated $T_2^{\\prime}$ efficiently by utilizing a linear model with a Lorentzian function, analytic solutions, and combined transitions.

    "abstract": "           We present a Monte Carlo study of energy extraction from rotating (Kerr) black holes via the Penrose process using rocket propulsion. Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \\gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \\approx 0.91c$). When conditions are highly tuned to a specific \"sweet spot,\" success rates can reach 88.5%, representing a narrow extraction window rather than generic behavior. Furthermore, single-impulse thrust at periapsis achieves significantly higher cumulative efficiency ($\\eta_{\\rm cum} \\approx 19\\%$) compared to continuous thrust ($\\sim$2--4%) due to path-averaging penalties. These constraints quantify the extreme fine-tuning required for material-based Penrose extraction, consistent with the astrophysical dominance of electromagnetic mechanisms.

A user-selected treatment plan with 36 source dwell positions was generated in a clinical treatment planning system (TPS), accounting for dosimeter dose ranges. Computational audit testing was performed by analyzing DICOM-RT files and conducting Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to obtain independent 3D dose calculations for the same plan and phantom geometry.

Procedures were optimized to minimize clinical this http URL:The pilot study was completed within ten days of phantom delivery. Measurement corrections were applied when necessary using correction factors from side studies. GI criteria were adapted to the uncertainty of each dosimetry system.

Broadband white noise probes the system and yields an LDOS lineshape near the momentum gap that can be decomposed into absorptive and dispersive Lorentzian components. The finite LDOS peak at the gap frequency, which grows with modulation strength, implies that the spontaneous emission rate of an emitter coupled to the PTC would be maximized at that frequency. The measured spectra are in good agreement with classical non-Hermitian Floquet theory. As the modulation-induced gain exceeds intrinsic losses, the system undergoes a transition to a narrow-band self-oscillation (lasing) regime. These results open a route to nonequilibrium photonics and bring time-periodic LDOS engineering closer to practical realization.         ",

Here, we present an all-silicon, electrically tunable photonic diode leveraging engineered chiral resonances in an ultra-compact microring architecture. The pronounced asymmetric modal coupling enables nonreciprocal transmission with two distinct operation modes at threshold powers down to -5 dBm. The chirality further enables unprecedented control over self-pulsation dynamics, manifesting in propagation-direction-dependent oscillation thresholds and temporal signatures. Crucially, post-fabrication electrical reconfigurability allows dynamic switching between forward, backward, and disabled states.

However, in practice, employing high-energy classical probes is often simpler than leveraging the quantum regime. This is not the case of covert sensing scenarios, where detection must be performed while avoiding to be discovered by an adversary, because increasing energy unduly facilitates the adversary. In this paper, we introduce a general framework to assess the quantum advantage in covert situations based on extending the information bottleneck principle to decision problems via the Chernoff information. We demonstrate how entangled photonic probes paired with photon counting significantly outperform classical coherent transmitters in covert detection and ranging, often representing the only option for secrecy. Thus, our work highlights the great potential of integrating quantum sensing into LiDAR and Radar systems to enhance covert performance.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum algorithms based on classical processing of individual samples have recently emerged as the most effective and robust methods to approximate ground-state wave functions of many-body quantum systems on pre-fault-tolerant and early-fault-tolerant quantum devices. In these algorithms, the quantum computer acts as a sampling engine that generates the subspace in which the Hamiltonian is classically diagonalized. The recently proposed Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD), uses quantum Krylov states as circuits from which samples are collected. Convergence guarantees can be derived for SKQD under similar assumptions to those of quantum phase estimation, provided that the ground-state wave function is well approximated by a polynomial subset of the full Hilbert space. However, implementations of SKQD for complex many-body Hamiltonians, such as quantum chemistry ones, are limited by the depths of time-evolution circuits needed to generate Krylov vectors. In this work, we introduce a method that combines SKQD with a qDRIFT randomized compilation of the Hamiltonian propagator. The resulting algorithm, termed SqDRIFT, enables quantum chemistry experiments on quantum processors, while preserving the convergence guarantees similar to the phase estimation algorithm. We demonstrate its viability by applying SqDRIFT to calculate the electronic ground-state energy of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, up to system sizes beyond the reach of exact diagonalization.
