    "title": "A Self-Consistent Model of Kinetic Alfven Solitons in Pulsar Wind Plasma: Linking Soliton Characteristics to Pulsar Observables",
    "abstract": "           We present a self-consistent model for the formation and propagation of kinetic Alfven (KA) solitons in the pulsar wind zone, where a relativistic, magnetized electron positron ion plasma flows along open magnetic field lines beyond the light cylinder. Using a reductive perturbation approach, we derive a Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation that governs the nonlinear evolution of KA solitons in this environment. The soliton amplitude and width are shown to depend sensitively on key pulsar observables, including spin period, spin-down rate, and pair multiplicity as well as plasma composition and suprathermal particle distributions. Our analysis reveals that soliton structures are strongly influenced by the presence of heavy ions, kappa-distributed pairs, and oblique propagation angles. Heavier ion species such as Fe26+ produce significantly broader solitons due to enhanced inertia and dispersion, while increasing pair multiplicity leads to smaller solitons through stronger screening. Oblique propagation (larger theta) results in wider but lower-amplitude solitons, and more thermalized pair plasmas (higher kappa) support taller and broader structures. A population-level analysis of 1174 pulsars shows a clear positive correlation between soliton width and spin period, with millisecond pulsars hosting the narrowest solitons. By linking soliton dynamics to measurable pulsar parameters, this work provides a framework for interpreting magnetospheric microphysics and its role in shaping pulsar emission signatures.         ",

    "abstract": "           Microplastics are increasingly recognized as a global environmental health threat, yet their detection and characterization remain constrained by the cost, form factor, and throughput of existing analytical tools. Portable micro/nanotechnology-based sensors are emerging to address this need, but most rely on the assumption of spherical particle geometry in their operating principle, limiting their relevance for environmental analysis. Here, we overcome this limitation by advancing microwave cytometry with machine learning-enabled shape recognition. Microwave cytometry is a flow-through electronic platform that integrates microwave resonator responses with low-frequency impedance signals to capture the dielectric signatures of individual particles. Using microscopy-derived shape measurements as ground truth, we trained a random forest model to decode these information-rich waveforms. Once trained, the system operates without optical input, enabling electronic-only determination of particle geometry. We demonstrate extraction of the major and minor axes of ellipsoidal microparticles with <8% relative error on average and use these predictions to derive the dielectric permittivity of ellipsoid particles. This approach removes long-standing shape assumptions in microplastic sensing and establishes a pathway toward portable, high-throughput, morphology-aware detection technologies.         ",

    "abstract": "           We compared the performance of two post-compression techniques, a gas-filled hollow-core fiber (HCF) and a multi-pass cell (MPC), using a high-power ytterbium-doped fiber laser. The HCF produced 27 fs pulses from 230 fs inputs at >50% efficiency, whereas the MPC achieved 34 fs pulses with significantly higher efficiency (>88%). Both results aligned well with numerical simulations. Crucially, spatial wavefront analysis revealed that the HCF acts as a modal filter, improving beam quality, whereas the MPC introduces aberrations through cumulative mirror errors. Furthermore, we characterize the photon flux of high harmonic generation driven by the post-compressed pulses from the HCF and MPC. These finding highlights that post-compression technique based on self-phase modulation is efficient for the intensity boosting of femtosecond laser system, providing opportunities for generating high quality extreme ultraviolet (XUV) sources. In addition, further improvement of spatial wavefront quality is suggested using the HCF as a single compressor or output component of the cascade compressor.         ",

    "abstract": "           High-energy laser facilities such as PHELIX at GSI require excellent beam pointing stability for reproducibility and relative independence for future experiments. Beam pointing stability has been traditionally achieved using simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control which removes the problem of slow drift, but is limited because of the time delay in knowing the diagnosis and the inertia in the mechanical system associated with mirrors. In this work, we introduce a predictive control strategy where the forecasting of beam pointing errors is performed by a patch-based multilayer perceptron (Patch-MLP) designed to capture local temporal patterns for more robust short-term jitter prediction. The subsequent conversion of these predicted errors into correction signals is handled by a PID controller. The neural network has been trained on diagnostic time-series data to predict beam pointing error. Using the feed-forward controller compensates for system delays. Simulations with a correction mirror placed upstream of the PHELIX pre-amplifier bridge confirm that the predictive control scheme reduces residual jitter compared to conventional PID control. Over a 10-hour dataset the controller maintained stable performance without drift, while standard pointing metrics showed consistent improvements of the order of 10 to 20 percent. The predictive controller operates without drift, and therefore may improve reproducibility and operational efficiency in high energy, low repetition rate laser experiment conditions.         ",

    "abstract": "           Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides are pivotal for next-generation photonic devices due to their exceptional optical properties and strong light-matter interactions. However, their atomic thinness renders them susceptible to damage during nanoscale fabrication. Focused ion beam technology, while offering precise defect engineering for tailoring optoelectronic properties, often induces collateral damage far beyond the target region, compromising device performance. This study addresses the critical challenge of preserving the intrinsic optical characteristics of 2D TMDCs during FIB patterning. We demonstrate that conventional dielectric encapsulation fails to protect 2D TMDCs from gallium ion-induced damage, leading to persistent defects and quenched optical responses in patterned microstructures. In contrast, polymeric encapsulation with PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) effectively mitigates damage by acting as a sacrificial layer that absorbs ion impact, thereby preserving the optical properties of the underlying TMDC. Furthermore, we leverage XeF2-assisted Ga ion beam direct patterning, which significantly reduces collateral damage, minimizes Ga ion implantation, and enables precise anisotropic material removal, yielding ultra-smooth sidewalls critical for high-quality photonic resonators. This combined approach of PMMA encapsulation and XeF2-assisted FIB patterning offers a robust, cost-effective, and scalable single-step fabrication route for integrating 2D TMDCs into high-performance photonic devices, thereby maintaining their intrinsic optical functionality essential for advancing quantum technologies and compact optical circuits.

Its design addresses the challenges of porting an existing hybrid pixel detector architecture into a monolithic chip, using a digital-on-top design methodology, and developing a compact digital cell library. Each square pixel integrates an analog front-end and digital pulse processing with an 8-bit counter within a \\SI{35}{\\micro\\meter}~pitch. This contribution presents the performance of H2M based on laboratory and test beam measurements, including a comparison with analog front-end simulations in terms of gain and noise. A particular emphasis is placed on backside thinning in order to reduce material budget, down to a total chip thickness of \\SI{21}{\\micro\\meter} for which no degradation in MIP detection performance is observed. For all investigated samples, a MIP detection efficiency above \\SI{99}{\\%} is achieved below a threshold of approximately 205 electrons. At this threshold, the fake-hit rate corresponds to a matrix occupancy of fewer than one pixel per the \\SI{500}{\\nano\\second}~frame. Measurements reveal a non-uniform in-pixel response, attributed to the formation of local potential wells in regions with low electric field. A simulation flow combining technology computer-aided design, Monte Carlo, and circuit simulations is used to investigate and describe this behavior, and is applied to develop mitigation strategies for future chip submissions with similar features.

The system features a counter-propagating beam at the same wavelength as the quantum state, which simultaneously actively stabilizes the cavity and, after transmission, acts as the local oscillator for homodyne detection. By deriving the local oscillator directly from the SPOPO cavity, the setup establishes an intrinsically excellent spatial mode overlap and high interference visibility, forming a distinctive self-referenced architecture. Two spatial light modulators enable precise spectral shaping of both the pump and the local oscillator in amplitude and phase, allowing investigation of the spectral properties of the generated states. The versatility of the setup further allows exploration of different SPOPO configurations, including regimes with varied finesse and escape efficiency. Representative measurements, including homodyne traces and squeezing levels as functions of pump power and local oscillator bandwidth, demonstrate the performance of the system. Theoretical simulations based on a multimode singular-value-decomposition model reproduce well the measured dependence of squeezing on pump power and LO bandwidth, confirming the accuracy of the description and the robustness of the setup.

While optical flow, a computer vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images, has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion, which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations, offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

While enhanced optical transmission through subwavelength apertures has been extensively studied in the linear regime, its extension to ultrashort, high-intensity pulses remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate, through three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, significant field enhancement of intense laser pulses in subwavelength plasma apertures. The enhancement exhibits a non-resonant character, remaining robust across a wide range of plasma densities and saturating above approximately $20n_c$, while showing minimal dependence on wall thickness. Analysis of the Poynting vector reveals that energy concentration arises from interference between the incident field and back-scattered longitudinal field components. This size-dependent enhanced transmission in plasma apertures enables potential applications such as plasma-based dichroic filters operating at extreme intensities.         ",

    "abstract": "           Advancing temporal resolution in computation, signal modulation, and measurement is crucial for pushing the frontiers of modern science and technology. Optical resonators have recently demonstrated computational operations at frequencies beyond the gigahertz range, surpassing conventional electronics, yet remain constrained by an inherent trade-off between temporal resolution and operation time -- limiting performance to the picosecond scale. Here we show that atoms and molecules can overcome this limitation, enabling attosecond-level temporal resolution with over 100,000-fold higher precision than state-of-the-art optical resonators while sustaining long operation times. When resonantly driven, these systems naturally perform temporal integration of the incident field envelope -- a process verified by solving the Bloch equations using four independent formulations in excellent agreement with analytic predictions. We identify feasible atomic transitions and excitation schemes realizable with current technology. Furthermore, we suggest techniques to differentiate and generate waveforms at such resolution. These results establish a new paradigm for attosecond-resolution optical computation, signal modulation, and ultrafast control in atomic and quantum systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           We describe how quantum Monte Carlo calculations using the CASINO software can be accelerated using graphics processing units (GPUs) and OpenACC. In particular we consider offloading Ewald summation, the evaluation of long-range two-body terms in the Jastrow correlation factor, and the evaluation of orbitals in a blip basis set. We present results for three- and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gases and ab initio simulations of bulk materials, showing that significant speedups of up to a factor of 2.5 can be achieved by the use of GPUs when several hundred particles are included in the simulations. The use of single-precision arithmetic can improve the speedup further without significant detriment to the accuracy of the calculations.         ",

    "title": "Non-Heisenbergian quantum mechanics",
    "abstract": "           Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\\hat x,\\hat p]=i\\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \\to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\\Delta x \\Delta p\\geq \\sqrt{\\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.

    "abstract": "           This study explores the organization of graphene quantum dots on the surface of monocrystalline halide perovskite. We show that graphene quantum dots tends to aggregate on the surface of perovskite unlike in solution or on other substrates, even at very low concentration of the initial solution that should yield single-molecule samples. Spectral analysis on small clusters shows a back-and-forth dynamical transition between an uncoupled, monomer-like state, and an excimer state. Following this \"dance\" between states, a drastic one-way increase in fluorescence intensity combined with a shortening of the excited state lifetime has been observed on some clusters. This behavior is related to the emission of a collective state that may be a consequence of the dynamical organization of graphene quantum dots under illumination on the surface of the perovksite.
