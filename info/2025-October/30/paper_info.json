    "abstract": "           The MeV Gamma-Gamma Collider would provide a direct experimental platform for elastic light-by-light scattering ($\\gamma\\gamma \\to \\gamma\\gamma$) and the Breit-Wheeler process with two real photons ($\\gamma\\gamma \\to e^+e^-$). A Monte Carlo code, the Genie Background Evaluation Tool (GBET), has been developed to fully simulate two successive inverse Compton scatterings in the linear regime, including $e^- + \\text{laser} \\to e^-+ \\gamma$ and $e^- + \\gamma \\rightarrow e^- + \\gamma$. GBET overcomes the inherent information loss in traditional luminosity-spectrum-based chain simulations, preserving full particle-level information and achieving higher physical fidelity. The effectiveness of the code is verified by benchmarking against the simulation results of CAIN. GBET shows that the event rate of background photons generated by the first inverse Compton scattering is $6.24 \\times 10^7$/s, with energies below 18 eV; the second inverse Compton scattering generates background electrons at 51.99/s and photons at 0.99/s, both with energies below 11 MeV. In addition, M\u00f8ller scattering contributes background electrons at 0.56/s with energies around 200 MeV. The count rates of background electrons and positrons originating from the Breit-Wheeler process are 1312.2/s and 1314.3/s, respectively, with energy distributions ranging from 511 to 720 keV.

    "abstract": "           Detection of sub-Hz gravitational waves is of significant importance for astrophysics. It enables the observation of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, the issuance of early alerts for gravitational-wave events, and the exploration of the stochastic gravitational-wave background. The Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS) is a proposed gravitational-wave detector based on a Sagnac speed-meter topology that uses torsion bars as test masses. Its prototype design aims to achieve a strain sensitivity of $3 \\times 10^{-18}~\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1~Hz and thus enable the detection of $\\mathcal{O}(10^4),M_\\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole mergers at 100~Mpc with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. We show that the torsion-bar-based speed meter can suppress noise originating from laser intensity fluctuations by canceling the net torque on the bar and by using a balanced homodyne readout. We further present, for the first time, an analytic intensity-noise model for a gravitational-wave detector employing a torsion-bar Sagnac speed-meter configuration. Using this model, we evaluate the expected performance of a 2.5~m arm-length CHRONOS prototype. The projected laser-intensity noise is $2.9 \\times 10^{-20}~\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1~Hz, which is sufficiently low to allow the detection of binary intermediate-mass black hole mergers.         ",

To address this challenge, we present a hybrid plasmonic dimer that functions in a non-Hermitian regime, capitalizing on the synergistic interplay between Epsilon Near Zero (ENZ) materials and phase-change materials (PCMs) to achieve superior reconfigurability through electrical modulation. Our approach harnesses non-Hermitian physics by precisely modulating the loss differential among coupled modes alongside their resonant frequencies, thereby steering the system to an Exceptional Point (EP) characterized by emergent phenomena and enhanced perturbation sensitivity. By integrating ENZ materials to control dissipation with PCMs to fine-tune resonant frequencies, our structure achieves robust programmability, delivering at least 16 distinct operational states for coupled resonators. This capability supports deep subwavelength confinement and transitions between EP and non-EP regimes, while the inherently low power consumption of ENZ materials and PCMs under deep-subwavelength confinement offers significant advantages even in high-dimensional configurations. We believe that this work outlines a significant route for next-generation programmable photonics, delivering subwavelength confinement, energy-efficient operation, and high-dimensional optical reconfigurability within an integrated, scalable, and manufacturable platform.

It is therefore crucial to efficiently generate free-electron wave functions that are suitable for these applications. In this study, we theoretically investigate an efficient free-space optical modulation of free electrons with two counter-propagating Gaussian beams. We find that the Gaussian beams' Gouy phase not only plays a crucial role in the interaction, but also enables straight-forward generation of valuable free-electron states, including comb-shape spectra with similar amplitudes, and states with high degree of coherence. We also discuss the feasibility of demonstrating these Gouy phase-related effects with chirped femto-second laser pulses. Our study establishes a theoretical foundation and physical intuition about the role of the Gouy phase. It can provide guidance to efficiently shape the free-electron wave function for a wide range of quantum applications.         ",

In particular, the three-dimensional (3D) position and 3D rotation of each 6DMA surface can be flexibly reconfigured to mitigate the beam squint effects instead of introducing costly true-time-delay devices. We first analyze the normalized array gain in the 6DMA-enabled wideband THz systems based on the beam squint effects. Then, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem via jointly optimizing 3D positions, 3D rotations, and hybrid analog/digital beamforming. To solve the non-convex problem, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed that decomposes the original problem into three subproblems, which are solved alternately. Specifically, given the positions and rotations of 6DMA surfaces, we first reformulate the objective function and design a semidefinite relaxation-based alternating minimization scheme to obtain the hybrid analog/digital beamforming. Then, the positions and rotations of the 6DMA surfaces are further optimized through a feasible gradient descent procedure. The final solutions are obtained by repeating the above procedure until convergence. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme compared with conventional fixed-position antenna architectures.         ",

The network is built to support a broad range of space missions operating between LEO and the Moon, using both conventional and advanced optical technologies developed at UWA. It is designed to be spacecraft and mission agnostic, able to be adapted for compatibility with spacecraft using a variety of communication and timing protocols. The TN network comprises three ground station nodes, each of which are equipped to support direct-detection, bidirectional optical communication with LEO spacecraft. In addition, each node is focused on the development of a unique advanced optics technology. Specifically: -TN-1 is a 70cm aperture OGS located on the campus of UWA. It uses ultra-sensitive optical detectors and specialised modulation formats to maximise the information recovered from spacecraft at lunar distances. -TN-2 is a 70cm aperture OGS at the Yarragadee Geodetic Observatory 300km North of Perth. It is equipped with a commercial-grade adaptive optics system for efficient single-mode fibre coupling. This enables high-speed coherent communications and ultra-precise coherent timing and positioning between ground and space. -TN-3 is a 43cm aperture mobile OGS node built onto the back of a utility vehicle for rapid, tactical deployment anywhere in the world. It is setup for quantum communication and quantum-assured time transfer and can establish satellite communication links within ten minutes of arriving on site, day or night. In this paper, we report on the results and outcomes of the TN commissioning campaign, including optical communication links with on-orbit spacecraft, the performance of the TN-2 adaptive optics system, the rapid deployment capability of TN-3, remote network operations of all three nodes, and interoperability tests with other OGSs across Australia and New Zealand.

These applications have motivated a growing demand for compact, reconfigurable vortex arrays with tunable topological charge, yet integrating these functionalities into nanophotonic platforms remains elusive. Among possible strategies to meet this challenge is exploiting the twist degree of freedom in layered structures, which enables both emerging moire physics and unprecedented reconfigurability of photonic and electronic properties. Here, we harness these capabilities in twisted bilayer moire photonic crystals (TBMPCs) to realize vortex array generation with tunable OAM, demonstrated both analytically and experimentally. Central to this advancement is a new class of quasi-bound state in the continuum: Bessel-type modes emerging from moire-induced interlayer coupling, which generate vortex beams with tailored spiral phase distributions. We experimentally demonstrate vortex beams spanning eight OAM orders, from -3 to 4, and achieve selective excitation of distinct topological charges at a fixed telecommunication wavelength by tuning the interlayer separation and twist angle. Furthermore, localized Bessel-type modes at AA stacking regions can be excited nonlocally across the moire superlattice, enabling vortex array generation. Our work offers new insights into moire physics and introduces an innovative approach for future multiplexing technology integrating OAM, wavelength, and spatial division.         ",

    "abstract": "           The self-sustaining oscillations in cavity flows enhance fluid mixing and promote energy and momentum transport. However, the associated oscillation frequencies can amplify acoustic loading, potentially damaging surrounding structures. Hence, understanding cavity dynamics across geometries and freestream conditions and developing strategies to regulate these oscillations without compromising performance are essential. This study examines the influence of sub-cavities placed at the front and aft walls of a cavity confined by a top wall with a deflection angle of 2.29 degrees, under freestream Mach numbers 2 and 3. Large eddy simulations (LES) are performed using OpenFOAM, and unsteady pressure signals are analyzed through spectral methods. Results show that the aft-wall sub-cavity most effectively suppresses the dominant oscillation at Mach number 2, while the front-wall sub-cavity achieves greater suppression at Mach number 3. Density gradient (numerical Schlieren) and vorticity fields, normalized acoustic impedance, and global wavelet power reveal the mechanisms responsible for this attenuation. At Mach number 2, the aft-wall sub-cavity entrains mass and disrupts the convective feedback loop. At Mach number 3, the front-wall sub-cavity weakens the hydrodynamic-acoustic coupling near the leading edge, disrupting the compressibility-driven feedback. These configurations suppress dominant frequencies by 5.45 and 23.4 percent for Mach numbers 2 and 3, respectively. Cross-correlation between pressure probes and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) further confirm the mechanisms behind the observed frequency suppression         ",

Here, we show that superluminal flying-focus pulses (FFPs) mitigate nonlinear propagation, thereby enhancing the number of high-energy electrons and resulting x-ray yield. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that, compared to a Gaussian pulse of equal energy (1 J) and intensity (2x10^20 W/cm^2), an FFP produces 80x more electrons above 100 MeV, increases the electron cutoff energy by 20%, triples the high-energy x-ray yield, and improves x-ray collimation.

It is well known that spontaneous emission depends on the radiative local density of states (RLDOS). Photonic band-gap crystals radically modulate the RLDOS, thereby controlling spontaneous emission. We compare two different methods to calculate the RLDOS: the plane-wave expansion (PWE) method and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The PWE method directly calculates the RLDOS of an infinite photonic crystal, whereas the FDTD method simulates the RLDOS through the power emitted by a dipole in a finite photonic crystal. We demonstrate that the methods yield similar frequency-dependent trends in the RLDOS, with relative differences of less than 12% that originate from the different boundary conditions. We employ the plane-wave expansion method to compute distributions of emission rates that are relevant to many optical experiments where quantum emitters are distributed within a crystal. Such distributions of emission rates enable us to compute and directly interpret the time-resolved decay as observed in experiments. We expect that our results promote the RLDOS to the realm of optical design and products.         ",

Here, we compare a control experiment, where the inverse barometer effect was not included, against a run dynamically forced with mean sea level pressure. In the control experiment, the inverse barometer effect was then calculated diagnostically and added to the ocean model sea surface elevation, resulting in a total of three experiments to investigate. We compare against the global GESLA3 water level data set and find that the inclusion of the inverse barometer effect reduces the root-mean-square error by $\\sim 1~cm$ on average. When we mask out all data where the observed storm surge is less than $\\pm1$ or $\\pm2$ standard deviations, including the inverse barometer effect reduces the RMS error by $4-5$ cm. While both methods reduce water level errors, there are regional differences in their performance. The run with dynamical pressure forcing is seen to perform slightly better than diagnostically adding the inverse barometer effect in enclosed basins such as the Baltic Sea. Finally, an ensemble forecast experiment with the Integrated Forecast System of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts demonstrates that when the diagnostic inverse barometer effect is included for a severe storm surge event in the North Sea (Storm Xaver, December 2013), the ensemble spread of water level provides a stronger and earlier indication of the observed maximum surge level than the when the effect is excluded.

This naturally limits the design scope and thus the potential applicability and performance. However, recent investigations suggest that incorporating novel, higher-dimensional linear-optical splitters in interferometer design can lead to several improvements. In this work, we review the underlying theory of these novel optical scatterers and some demonstrated configurations with enhanced resolution. The basic principles of optical interference and optical phase sensing are discussed in tandem. Emphasis is placed on both familiar and unfamiliar scatterers, such as the maximally-symmetric Grover multiport, whose actions are left unchanged by certain gauge transformations. These higher-dimensional, gauge-invariant multiports embody a new class of building blocks which can tailor optical interference for metrology in unconventional ways.         ",

    "abstract": "           Optical techniques for spatiotemporal control can produce laser pulses with custom amplitude, phase, or polarization structure. In nonlinear optics and plasma physics, the use of structured pulses typically follows a forward design approach, in which the efficacy of a known structure is analyzed for a particular application. Inverse approaches, in contrast, enable the discovery of new structures with the potential for superior performance. Here, an implementation of the unidirectional pulse propagation equation that supports automatic differentiation is combined with gradient-based optimization to design structured pulses with features that are advantageous for a range of nonlinear optical and plasma-based applications: (1) a longitudinally uniform intensity over an extended region, (2) a superluminal intensity peak that travels many Rayleigh ranges with constant duration, spot size, and amplitude, and (3) a laser pulse that ionizes a gas to form a uniform column of plasma. In the final case, optimizing the full spatiotemporal structure improves the performance by a factor of 15 compared to optimizing only spatial or only temporal structure, highlighting the advantage of spatiotemporal control.

    "abstract": "           Due to the wide range of technical applications of actinide elements, a thorough understanding of their electronic structure could complement technological improvements in many different areas. Quantum computing could greatly aid in this understanding, as it can potentially provide exponential speedups over classical approaches, thereby offering insights into the complex electronic structure of actinide compounds. As a first foray into quantum computational chemistry of actinides, this paper compares the method of quantum computed moments (QCM) as a noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithm with a single-ancilla version of quantum phase estimation (QPE), a quantum algorithm expected to run on fault-tolerant quantum computers. We employ these algorithms to study the reaction energetics of plutonium oxides and hydrides. In order to enable quantum hardware experiments, we use several techniques to reduce resource requirements: screening individual Hamiltonian Pauli terms to reduce the measurement requirements of QCM and variational compilation to reduce the depth of QPE circuits. Finally, we derive electronic structure descriptions from a series of representative chemical models and compute the energetics from quantum experiments on Quantinuum's H-series ion trap devices using up to 19 qubits. We find our experiments to be in excellent agreement with results from classical electronic structure calculations and state vector simulations.         ",

Here we introduce a method that parameterizes the solution using spectral bases on arbitrary spatiotemporal domains, whereby the basis is defined on a hyperrectangle containing the true domain. We find the coefficients of the basis expansion by solving an optimization problem whereby both the equations, the boundary conditions and any optimization targets are enforced by a loss function, building on a key idea from Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Since the representation of the function natively has exponential convergence, so does the solution of the optimization problem, as long as it can be solved efficiently. We find empirically that the optimization protocols developed for machine learning find solutions with exponential convergence on a wide range of equations. The method naturally allows for the incorporation of data assimilation by including additional terms in the loss function, and for the efficient solution of optimization problems over the PDE solutions.

The flow is forced by an axisymmetric beam of progressive sound waves attenuating over a significant part of a closed cylindrical vessel where the jet is confined. We focus on the steady, axisymmetric and laminar regime. The jet typically displays a strong acceleration close to the source before reaching a peak velocity. At further distances from the transducer, the on-axis jet velocity smoothly decays before reaching the opposite wall. For each of these flow regions along the jet, we derive scaling laws for the on-axis velocity with the magnitude of the acoustic force and the diffraction of the driving acoustic beam. These laws highlight the different flow regimes along the jet and establish a clear picture of its spatial structure, able to inform the design of experimental or industrial setups involving Eckart streaming jets.

    "abstract": "           Accurate prediction of shallow-donor electron binding energies is critical for device modeling, dopant activation, and donor-based quantum technologies. Traditional beyond-DFT approaches (e.g., hybrid functionals, GW) are prohibitively expensive for the large supercells needed to capture the extended, hydrogenic wavefunctions, while semi-local DFT underestimates band gaps and suffers from delocalization errors. We present a simple, practical protocol for shallow donors based on the DFT-1/2 approximate quasiparticle correction that maintains the computational cost of standard DFT and enables supercells up to thousands of atoms. This approach provides a straightforward and reproducible workflow that delivers reliable donor binding energies with minimal computational overhead. Applied to group-V donors in Si, Si:X (X= P, As, Sb, Bi), the method yields binding energies in close agreement with experiment. We found that, for Si:Bi, it is essential to include spin-orbit coupling to achieve near-experimental values with a difference of only $\\sim$ 4 meV. For arsenic, the method yields excellent agreement with experiment, with a difference of only ~0.3 meV. For antimony, the results match experiment to within ~5 meV, and for phosphorus, the deviation is within ~8 meV. Beyond its high accuracy, DFT-1/2 offers a significant practical advantage, providing a straightforward, reproducible, and transferable workflow that is less demanding than hybrid functional approaches while remaining fully generalizable to other shallow impurities in semiconductors.
