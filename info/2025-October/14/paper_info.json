    "abstract": "           Experiments on 2D random water wave propagation in a large wave tank are analyzed when the effect of dispersion changes. A stereoscopic profilometry technique is used to measure the water surface displacement resolved in both time and space over a significant fraction of the wave tank. The wave regimes are characterized by analyzing the space-time spectral statistical properties of the wave field. At a given, finite, water depth, the effect of dispersion can be varied by tuning the peak frequency of the wave generation. In shallow water conditions, the waves are only weakly dispersive and this enables the propagation of solitons. {In these conditions random wave forcing produces soliton gases}. In deep water conditions, the waves are dispersive and for wideband spectra, one observes the development of weak turbulence. A transition between these regimes is observed when changing the peak forcing frequency (dispersion) and the wave amplitude (nonlinearity), with a clear threshold between states with solitons and soliton-less states. The development of a soliton gas is associated with a strong change of the wave spectrum as well as a significant evolution of the distribution of the water elevation. We also observed a strong effect of the finite size of the tank due to the peculiar reflection laws of line solitons.         ",

    "abstract": "           High-Current Accelerator-driven Neutron Sources (HiCANS) are currently under development across Europe to address the shortage of medium-scale neutron sources, as many research nuclear reactors have been decommissioned over the past several years. At CEA-Saclay, a HiCANS has been developed utilizing the IPHI accelerator, which delivers a 3 MeV proton beam with a current of up to 100 mA, and the CEA-Saclay liquid lithium target named SATELIT. In 2024-2025, a successful experimental campaign was conducted, during which a 10 kW proton beam was directed at the liquid lithium target for nearly 100 h to generate neutrons via the 7Li(p,n)7Be nuclear reaction. Throughout the experimental campaign, a total deposited beam power of 840~kW.h was accumulated, including two continuous operational days exceeding 11 h each. A polyethylene moderator coupled with SATELIT enabled the extraction of a thermal neutron beam, with a flux measured at 1.4 m from the extraction point exceeding $10^6$ this http URL$^{-2}$.s$^{-1}$, which is sufficient for numerous neutron applications. The next step for the long-term operation of this facility involves developing strategies to mitigate the radiological concerns associated with the accumulation of 7Be within the system. Overall, this work demonstrates that such facilities can play a significant role in the future of medium-scale neutron sources in Europe.         ",

However, sub-relativistic experimental demonstration has so far been limited by bunch charges well below 1 electron per bunch due to the low acceptance of these 'accelerator-on-a-chip' devices. Here, we propose a novel design for an injector tailor made for dielectric laser acceleration, based on just-above-threshold ionization of laser-cooled atoms. The key new feature is a an innovative magnet design that avoids apparent emittance growth by using the field-free regions of an axially polarised ring of permanent magnets as source point. We optimized this design using a multi-objective optimization approach that is also applicable to the development of other sub-relativistic, high-brightness/low-emittance electron beam setups (like setups for ultrafast electron diffraction). The expected injected bunch charge of our proposed injector is 90 (60) electrons for a dielectric laser acceleration gradient of 1 GV/m (100MV/m) operating at a 10 micron driver laser wavelength, increasing the expected bunch charge by about two orders of magnitude.

    "abstract": "           Tumor Obliteration by Resonant Amplification (TOR) was evaluated purely in simulation. Forward models in COMSOL, ANSYS, and ABAQUS used the same small-strain rheology, nonthermal/noncavitational limits, and an emulated closed loop (phase-locked actuation plus contrast/safety gating). Over >= 200 Monte Carlo runs per setup, TOR produced per-focus extinction in 2.6-3.2 s at approx. 0.85-0.90 J/cm^3, with selectivity Q = 39 +/- 5, peak temperature rise dT_max <= 0.2 deg C, and CEM43 << 1, consistent with strictly nonthermal operation. Primary indices indicated high spectral fidelity and intrinsic safety margin: MMI = 0.92 +/- 0.03, SSR = 14.6 +/- 3.1 (circumscribed) / 11.2 +/- 2.4 (infiltrative), and ATI <= 0.8 of the matrix-failure threshold. Simulated foci matched FE predictions within +/- 150 um. A unitless reality-adherence score comparing four observables to consolidated literature ranges yielded A = 95% +/- 2% (BCa 95%). Organ-specific estimates were 95.1% (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma), 96.0% (prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma), and 94.2% (invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast). The delivery stack - tungsten micro-needle (300-500 um) with 5-25 um tip excursions, phase lock, and amplitude gating - operated in a small-strain, noncavitational regime, keeping off-target strain below safety limits by design. Mechanistically, mode-selective collapse implies suppression of core vesicle biogenesis and nociceptor drive; rim scanning is constrained by healthy-referenced bounds, motivating compact neuroimmune readouts in future tests. Overall, the calibrated multiphysics results support a reproducible, spectrum-locked path from modeling to benchtop: deterministic extinction at low energy, high selectivity, and strict thermal neutrality, with pre-registered experiments planned to confirm the predicted safety and efficacy envelopes.

Furthermore, we validate these algorithms by numerically computing the density of states and spatial distributions of electronic states in graphene, twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals, and fractal lattices, covering system sizes from hundreds to thousands of atoms.

However, the fundamental scale mismatch between optical wavelengths and molecules restricts the application of label-free techniques, leading to poor signal-to-noise (SNR) performance. Here, we propose a high-contrast, label-free approach based on interferometric imaging, utilizing the strong evanescent field supported on a microfiber surface to provide near-field illumination. We observed unique interference patterns generated by in-plane scattering from natural defects, which enabled high-contrast detection of localized phase changes induced by single molecules. The results indicate an approximately 38 dB enhancement in SNR over the conventional fluorescence methods, without employing any plasmonic or microcavity-based amplification techniques. This approach was further applied to track molecular dynamics, capturing both conformational transition and binding behaviors of individual protein molecules. Meanwhile, the stimulus-response of single molecules to acoustic waves was investigated, demonstrating the ultimate miniaturization of an acoustic sensor at the single-molecule scale. By enabling direct observation of molecular dynamics and mechanical responses at the single-molecule level, this approach provides a versatile platform for probing fundamental biological processes and developing ultra-sensitive biosensors. Moreover, this approach lays the foundation for coupling optical and acoustic waves at the molecular scale, opening new avenues for next-generation single-molecule diagnostics and precision biophysics studies.

However, efficient and tunable emission amplification post-fabrication poses major challenges. Hybrid metasurfaces combining niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5), copper indium sulfide (CIS) quantum dots or hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) as a low-loss phase-change material offer a compelling solution for dynamic control and amplification of photoluminescence and quantum light emission. In this work, we report an active hybrid metasurface supporting tunable bound states in the continuum (BIC) resonances in the visible regime, achieving experimental Q-factors up to 206 and strong amplification of CIS QDs photoluminescence as well as quantum light emission of hBN single-photon emitters. The metasurface enables BIC resonance shifts of 33.5 nm in the visible spectrum via phase transition of Sb2S3, and 17 nm through dimensional parametric tuning. We experimentally demonstrate highly directional photoluminescence amplification up to 33-fold, alongside broad tunable amplified PL emission upon Sb2S3 phase modulation. Furthermore, we propose amplified, tunable, and on-demand strong coupling of hBN single-photon emitters with the tunable BIC metasurface for next-generation broadband quantum nanophotonic chips.

    "abstract": "           Efficient and reliable light coupling between optical fibers and photonic integrated circuits has arguably been the most essential issue in integrated photonics for optical interconnects, nonlinear signal conversion, neuromorphic computing, and quantum information processing. A commonly employed approach is to use inverse tapers interfacing with lensed fibers, particularly for waveguides of relatively low refractive index such as silicon nitride (Si3N4), silicon oxynitride and lithium niobate. This approach simultaneously enables broad operation bandwidth, high coupling efficiency, and simplified fabrication. While diverse taper designs have been invented and characterized so far, lensed fibers play equally important roles here, but their optimization has long underexplored. Here we fill this gap and introduce a comprehensive co-optimization strategy that synergistically refines the geometries of the taper and the lensed fiber. By incorporating the genuine lensed fiber's shape into simulation, we accurately capture the non-Gaussian emission profile of the lensed fiber, nullifying the widely accepted approximation using a paraxial Gaussian mode. We further characterize many lensed fibers and Si3N4 tapers of varying shapes using different fabrication processes. Our experimental and simulation results show remarkable agreement, both achieving maximum coupling efficiencies exceeding 80% per facet. Finally, we summarize the optimal choices of lensed fibers and Si3N4 tapers that can be directly deployed in modern CMOS foundries for scalable manufacturing of Si3N4 photonic integrated circuits. Our study not only contributes to light coupling solutions, but is also critical for photonic packaging and optoelectronic assembly that are currently revolutionizing datacenters and AI.         ",

For sensors working at the critical coupling regime, we provide here a complete formalism that describes analytically the Goos-Hanchen shift, the Goos-H\u00e4nchen sensitivity and the limit of detection. It reveals the key parameters (quality factor, angular dispersion but also the phase singularity) which are involved in the GH shift. Approaching the critical coupling leads to ultimate Goos-H\u00e4nchen shift and sensitivity. Thanks to this theoretical description confirmed numerically, we propose lateral beam displacement that goes beyond giant GH shift and sensitivity values as high as $10^{13} {\\mu}m/RIU$ which is an improvement of Goos-H\u00e4nchen sensitivity by more than one thousand compared to theoretical value and more than ten million if compared to experimental works. We illustrate it for surface plasmon resonance of thin metal film where the critical coupling is approached with the crystallisation of a phase change material GST and for metasurfaces supporting Bloch Surface Waves. We also discuss the effect of beam size on GH effect and showed that it is the main limitation for increasing GH sensitivty and is a parameter that must be considered. The limit of detection of GH sensors is finally described analytically. Theses results open the way for new sensing application needing high sensitivity.         ",

The high-frequency A1 and A3 mode resonators with spurious-free responses are comprehensively designed, fabricated, and characterized. The quality factors of A1 modes gradually increase upon cryogenic cooling and shows 4 times higher than the room temperature value, while A3 mode resonators exhibit a non-monotonic temperature dependence.

    "abstract": "           Silicon carbide (SiC) planar PiN diodes from two different manufacturers were irradiated with 252.7 MeV protons from a medical synchrotron. Over the course of two 8h irradiation shifts, the samples were exposed to increasing fluences ranging from 1.4e+11 to 3.5e+13 p+/cm^2. Electrical characterizations, including IV and CV measurements, were performed both before and after irradiation using probe stations, and for selected samples even in-situ between fluence steps directly at the irradiation facility. The results show a gradual compensation of the effective epitaxial doping concentration with each incremental fluence step, observed as a reduction in capacitance before full depletion and confirmed by the extracted effective doping concentration. From these measurements, linear donor removal rates are determined for all sample groups, with values ranging from 4.2/cm to 6.4/cm. These findings provide a quantitative basis for understanding radiation-induced charge carrier removal in 4H-SiC devices and are relevant for predicting the performance and lifetime of future radiation-hard detector technologies, including 4H-SiC LGADs.

    "abstract": "           Raman microspectroscopy provides non-destructive, structure-specific contrast suited to in situ monitoring of femtosecond (fs) laser fabrication processes. In this work, we introduce a sample-agnostic Raman workflow that screens candidate spectral indicators using drift-resistant, self-normalized metrics and, where appropriate, label-free hyperspectral unmixing to extract endmembers and validate metric selection. Using diamond as an example, hyperspectral maps and electrical tests show that depletion of the 1332 cm-1 sp3 line is a monotonic, robust predictor of resistance, counterintuitively outperforming sp2-based measures often assumed optimal. This enables a practical implementation: a single narrowband channel at the selected marker provides real-time feedback without full-spectrum acquisition. Because the selection hinges on general band definitions and functional validation rather than diamond-specific physics, the approach translates Raman phase information directly into device specifications and is transferable to other Raman-active hosts for in-line quality control of laser-written structures.

    "abstract": "           Reconfigurable arrays of neutral atoms are a leading platform for quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. The most common method for atom reconfiguration using optical tweezers relies on frequency chirping of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). However, chirp-induced acoustic lensing limits the speed of atom transport by deformation of the tweezer profile and warping of the tweezer trajectory. We use a three-dimensional acousto-optic deflector lens (3D-AODL) to mitigate both effects, a design predicted to halve current state-of-the-art long-range transport times. Additionally, we introduce fading-Shepard waveforms that bypass the finite AOD bandwidth and thus enable sustained axial displacement. We demonstrate unrestricted 3D motion within a cuboid volume of at least 200 $\\mu$m $\\times$ 200 $\\mu$m $\\times$ 136 $\\mu$m, with tweezer velocities exceeding 4.2 m/s. The ability to move optical tweezers along arbitrary trajectories in 3D should enable rapid in-plane and out-of-plane rearrangement of atoms in 2D or 3D tweezer arrays and optical lattices, as well as omnidirectional trajectories and dynamical engineering of optical potentials. This technology has the potential to advance quantum control and atom manipulation in current atom-array quantum computers, boosting clock rates and enabling rapid sorting in geometries scalable to millions of qubits.

The stitching technique is employed to fabricate sensors with dimensions of 1.4 $\\times$ 25.9 cm, thinned to 50 $\\mu$m. The chip architecture, in-pixel front-end, laboratory and in-beam characterisation, susceptibility to single-event effects, and series testing are discussed. The testing campaign validates the design of a wafer-scale stitched sensor and the performance of the pixel matrix to be within the ITS3 requirements. The MOSS chip demonstrates the feasibility of the ITS3 detector concept and provides insights for further optimisation and development.         ",

    "abstract": "           The novel combination of a strongly-resonant optical metasurface with the MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer is proposed for efficient free-space lasing enabled by the enhanced coupling between the optical and matter (exciton) states. The metasurface comprises silicon-rich nitride meta-atoms periodically arrayed in a subdiffractive lattice and overlaid with MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$, which provides optically-pumped gain around $1130~\\mathrm{nm}$. Light emission is enabled by exploiting a quasi-bound state in the continuum in the form of a perturbed vertical magnetic dipole resonance. Following a meticulous design process guided by full-wave simulations and multipole expansion analysis, an ultralow lasing threshold of $\\sim 6~\\mathrm{kW/cm^2}$ is achieved. Moreover, the thermal stability of the lasing structure is examined through heat transfer simulations; stable operation with pump power densities up to a few MW/cm$^2$ (three orders of magnitude above the threshold) is predicted. These results demonstrate that MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$-based metasurface lasers can exhibit robust operation, paving the way for highly-performing ultrathin light-emitting surfaces. The lasing response is rigorously assessed through a highly-efficient temporal coupled-mode theory framework, verified by time-domain FEM simulations showing excellent agreement. Thus, an efficient and accurate approach to design and study metasurface lasers with arbitrary geometries and surface or bulk gain media is introduced, exhibiting significant advantages over cumbersome full-wave simulations.

In the thermal infrared domain, where radiation follows Planck's law, the self-emission of materials reveals intrinsic properties and internal degradation. By contrast, in the near-infrared range, external illumination enhances surface details and pigment differentiation. Far-infrared and terahertz techniques, operating in both transmission and reflection modes, provide complementary insights by penetrating surface layers to uncover subsurface structures and concealed features. Integrating visible and infrared imaging further enriches diagnostic capabilities by correlating conventional visual assessments with spectral information. Beyond reviewing the wide applications of these NII techniques in cultural heritage research, this work also summarizes recent advances in signal processing, encompassing both hardware and software developments. In particular, deep learning has revolutionized the field by enabling automated classification, feature extraction, defect detection, and super-resolution imaging. Through supervised and unsupervised learning strategies, neural networks can reliably identify subtle anomalies and material variations indicative of past restorations or early stages of deterioration. In conclusion, the convergence of advanced spectral imaging, sophisticated signal processing, and deep neural networks offers a transformative pathway toward more accurate, efficient, and data-driven cultural heritage analysis, ultimately supporting more informed conservation and restoration decisions.

    "abstract": "           We present a reduced-scaling auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) framework designed for large molecular systems and ensembles, with or without coupling to optical cavities. Our approach leverages the natural block sparsity of Cholesky decomposition (CD) of electron repulsion integrals in molecular ensembles and employs tensor hypercontraction (THC) to efficiently compress low-rank Cholesky blocks. By representing the Cholesky vectors in a mixed format, keeping high-rank blocks in block-sparse form and compressing low-rank blocks with THC, we reduce the scaling of exchange-energy evaluation from quartic to robust cubic in the number of molecular orbitals, while lowering memory from cubic toward quadratic. Benchmark analyses on one-, two-, and three-dimensional molecular ensembles (up to ~1,200 orbitals) show that: a) the number of nonzeros in Cholesky tensors grows linearly with system size across dimensions; b) the average numerical rank increases sublinearly and does not saturate at these sizes; and (c) rank heterogeneity-some blocks nearly full rank and many low rank, naturally motivating the proposed mixed block sparsity and THC scheme for efficient calculation of exchange energy. We demonstrate that the mixed scheme yields cubic CPU-time scaling with favorable prefactors and preserves AFQMC accuracy.         ",

Specifically, the ability of QAOA to sample from the Gibbs distribution, equivalently the Boltzmann distribution, defined by a classical Ising model, specifically a fully connected disordered spin glass (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick) model. We focus on two different QAOA mixers; the standard transverse field X mixer, and the Grover mixer. At a QAOA depth of one we examine, for a single full QAOA parameter search space period, the energy landscape, the Shannon entropy landscape of the QAOA probability distribution, and the tradeoff between Boltzmann distribution sampling temperature and error rate (how close to the true Boltzmann distribution is the QAOA distribution). We find that at very high temperatures one-round Grover mixer QAOA can sample from the Boltzmann distribution more accurately than the standard X mixer QAOA at one round. Both X mixer and Grover mixer depth one QAOA can serve as approximate Boltzmann distribution samplers, and how good this approximation is depends heavily on the QAOA angle choice.         ",

We derive its field operator and group velocity, extending the Fleischhauer-Lukin model to a dual-wavelength regime, and formulate a memory protocol enabling bidirectional storage and retrieval between the two modes. Numerical simulations of the full six-level dynamics confirm two-way storage and retrieval for both same-mode and cross-mode operation between the two wavelengths.

The problem is acute in many applications, such as in high-resolution microscopy of biological tissue, where scattering degrades both resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that uniting two intrinsic properties of scattered light: speckle statistics and the angular memory effect, with highly non-linear optical response yields, rather surprisingly, super-resolution, low-background, non-invasive imaging of objects completely hidden behind a strongly scattering, opaque layer. Crucially, our technique of non-invasive imaging through scatterers does not resort to wavefront shaping, adaptive optics, complicated optical setups, or iterative image reconstruction algorithms. Because the strategy relies solely on the properties of scattered light and high-order nonlinear response of the fluorophores, it can be applied to any speckle-forming propagation, from biological tissue to multicore fibres, combined with any type of phenomenon that exhibits a sufficiently high order nonlinearity.

We observe distinct cavity-induced energy shifts and cavity-enhanced decay rate in the $2p3d$ RIXS spectra of WSi$_{2}$. These effects, manifesting as stretched or shifted profiles in the RIXS planes, enable novel spectroscopic applications by cavity-controlled core-hole states. Our results establish core-to-core RIXS as a powerful tool for manipulating inner-shell dynamics in x-ray cavities, offering new avenues for integrating quanutm optical effects with x-ray spectroscopy.

    "title": "Breakdown of the Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation by a spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurface",
    "abstract": "           Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, fundamentally limits the efficiency of photonic systems by enforcing reciprocal energy exchange between source and detector. Breaking this reciprocity is particularly important for advancing photonic devices for energy conversion, radiative cooling, and mid-infrared sensing and imaging. Driven by the growing need for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the first demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces operating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the Kirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated photonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from a metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical framework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation with unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral directional Kirchhoff's law. Our experiment and theory imply effective decoupling of absorption and emission channels by breaking time-reversal symmetry at thermal wavelengths.         ",

    "abstract": "           We report the first characterization results of an optical time-stamping camera based on the Timepix4 chip coupled to a fully depleted optical silicon sensor and fast image intensifier, enabling sub-nanosecond scale, time-resolved imaging for single photons. The system achieves an RMS time resolution of 0.27 ns in direct detection mode without the intensifier and from 0.55 to 1.4 ns in the single-photon regime with intensifier for different amplitude-based signal selections. This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, pixel count, and data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including sensor bias and time-walk, and demonstrate effective correction methods to recover high temporal accuracy. The camera temporal resolution, event-driven readout and high rate capability make it a scalable platform for a wide range of applications, including quantum optics, ultrafast imaging, and time-correlated photon counting experiments.

    "title": "Lossless Postselected Quantum Metrology with Quasi-pure Mixed States",
    "abstract": "           Postselection can compress the metrological information and improve sensitivity in the presence of certain types of technical noise. Postselected quantum metrology with pure states has been significantly advanced recently. However, extending this framework to mixed states leads to formidable challenges, such as the difficulty in searching for lossless postselection measurements or even the loss of metrological information. In this work, we leverage the intuition for the lossless postselection of pure states and generalize the theory to the lossless postselection of a class of mixed states, dubbed quasi-pure states. We illustrate our findings in postselected quantum imaging, unitary estimation problems, and show that the quasi-pure structure can be universally engineered through only classical correlation with an ancilla. Our findings extend the utility of postselection techniques to scenarios with decoherence and also offer new perspectives to foundational questions in quantum information geometry.         ",

    "abstract": "           Left on its own, a quantum state evolves deterministically under the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation, forming superpositions. Upon measurement, however, a stochastic process governed by the Born rule collapses it to a single outcome. This dual evolution of quantum states -- the core of the Measurement Problem -- has puzzled physicists and philosophers for nearly a century. Yet, amid the cacophony of competing interpretations, the problem today is not as impenetrable as it once seemed. This paper reviews the current status of the Measurement Problem, distinguishing between what is well understood and what remains unresolved. We examine key theoretical approaches, including decoherence, many-worlds interpretation, objective collapse theories, hidden-variable theories, dualistic approaches, deterministic models, and epistemic interpretations. To make these discussions accessible to a broader audience, we also reference curated online resources that provide high-quality introductions to central concepts.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present the design and assembly of a cavity microscope for quantum simulations with ultracold atoms. The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of \\SI{19.786}{\\milli\\meter}, a finesse of \\SI{2.35}{\\times 10^4} and operates \\SI{214}{\\micro\\meter} away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.
