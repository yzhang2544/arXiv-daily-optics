    "abstract": "           This paper presents a bio-inspired underwater whisker sensor for robust hydrodynamic disturbance detection and efficient signal analysis based on Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC). The design uses a tapered nylon spring with embedded accelerometers to achieve spatially distributed vibration sensing and frequency separation along the whisker. Towing-tank experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that the whisker effectively distinguishes vortex regimes across different fin angles and maintains Strouhal scaling with flow velocity, where higher speeds increase vibration intensity without affecting the dominant frequencies. Frequency-domain analysis, Shannon entropy, and machine learning further validated the sensing performance: vortex shedding frequencies were identified with less than 10\\% error, entropy captured the transition from coherent vortex streets to turbulence, and logistic regression achieved 86.0\\% classification accuracy with millisecond-level inference. These results demonstrate that structurally encoded whisker sensing provides a scalable and real-time solution for underwater perception, wake tracking, and turbulence-aware navigation in autonomous marine robots.

In this paper we describe the formalism and implementation of the Factorized Electron Nuclear Dynamics (FENDy) with effective complex potential [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 19 (2023), pp 1393-1408], which goes beyond the established framework of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation or Born-Huang expansion of the molecular wavefunction. This method is based on the exact factorization of the molecular wavefunction, with the nuclei evolving under a complex time-dependent potential which captures the key features of dynamics in the nuclear subspace. The complementary electronic component of the molecular wavefunction is normalized to one for all nuclear configurations. We implement and employ FENDy to model the dynamics of H$_2^+$ molecular ion under a femtosecond laser pulse. The electronic wavefunction is represented within the standard electronic structure bases without referencing the electronic eigenstates. The nuclear wavefunction is represented as a quantum-trajectory ensemble, which in principle circumvents the exponential scaling of the numerical cost with the system size. The challenging evaluation of the gradients on unstructured grids is performed by projection on auxiliary bases.         ",

In the domain of optics, laser beams that are spatially shaped as Airy functions (`Airy beams') have been shown to exhibit a prominent lobe that follows a curved path, rather than propagating in a straight line, and which has self-healing properties in the presence of obstacles. Here, we observe the presence of Airy resonances in two-dimensional photonic crystals composed of a lattice of holes in a silicon slab. Analogously to electrons in a linear potential, these Airy resonances arise due to a linear spatial variation in the lattice constant of the holes. We map the electromagnetic description of the photonic crystal onto a 2D non-Hermitian Schrodinger equation with a linear potential, which we call a `superpotential'. The non-Hermiticity appears in the form of a complex effective mass due to out-of-plane radiation and fundamentally alters the collective optical response of the Airy resonances.         ",

Meanwhile, magnetic photonic crystals have served as cornerstone platforms for manipulating light propagation, facilitating key applications such as Faraday rotation-based isolators and non-reciprocal devices. Nevertheless, the synergistic integration of twist engineering and magneto-optical effects in bi-layer architectures remains unexplored. This work introduces twisted magnetic bi-layer photonic crystal slabs as a novel platform to unify these degrees of freedom. By continuously tuning the twist angle between two magneto-active photonic layers, the giant circular dichroism is observed, and the transmitted waves can be perfectly linearly polarized and rotated. These effects arise from the interplay between resonant properties of the Moir\u00e9 cell and magnetization-dependent coupling of circularly polarized states. This work establishes a foundation for magnetic topological photonics, bridging twistronics and magneto-optics to unlock new mechanisms for dynamic light control in compact and reconfigurable devices.

By tuning the local non resonant intensity pattern the exciton and biexciton energies were calculated, electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) windows were examined, and correspondingly near-field diffraction carpets were dynamically reshaped. A single parameter the activation ratio between illuminated and dark nanorods provides continuous control over photoluminescence peak position (80 meV) and EIT bandwidth (six times). We further predict fully programmable Talbot self-imaging in nanorod arrays with sub-wavelength pitch. Importantly, the observed Talbot carpets enable spatially resolved identification of which nanorods were excited, offering a powerful diagnostic for verifying structured-light activation schemes. The concept offers a low crosstalk, wafer scale route toward reconfigurable quantum emitters, tunable diffractive optics and on-chip slow-light components.         ",

The recoil spectra are affected by interactions between the radioactive implants and the sensor materials. We are therefore developing aluminum-based STJs (Al-STJs) as an alternative to existing tantalum devices (Ta-STJs) to investigate how to separate material effects in the recoil spectrum from potential signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model. Three iterations of Al-STJs were fabricated. The first had electrode thicknesses similar to existing Ta-STJs. They had low responsivity and reduced resolution, but were used successfully to measure $^7$Be nuclear recoil spectra. The second iteration had STJs suspended on thin SiN membranes by backside etching. These devices had low leakage current, but also low yield. The final iteration was not backside etched, and the Al-STJs had thinner electrodes and thinner tunnel barriers to increase signal amplitudes. These devices achieved 2.96 eV FWHM energy resolution at 50 eV using a pulsed 355 nm (~3.5 eV) laser. These results establish Al-STJs as viable detectors for systematic material studies in the BeEST experiment.         ",

We present an alternative approach to angle-based sensing, introducing optical vortices stable phase singularities within each subaperture of the Shack-Hartmann (S-H) architecture. Rather than changing the fundamental angle-based operating principle, it transforms the tracked quantity and its detection method. The presence of a singularity enables a dedicated tracking algorithm that outperforms conventional methods without increasing computational complexity. We evaluated its performance against the conventional S-H across a broad SNR range (from 2 to 22), corresponding to shot noise limited to high saturation regimes, demonstrating lower mean residual phase variance across all conditions. This work demonstrates that structured beam shaping can extend the capabilities of traditional S-H architectures without requiring fundamental redesign.         ",

This study investigates the optical Kerr effect (OKE) enhancement in high-refractive-index metasurfaces featuring non-BIC trapped-mode resonances, using gallium phosphide (GaP) as a model material. Three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations reveal a significant enhancement of the effective second-order refractive index, reaching values up to 700 times greater than bulk GaP. The numerical results show strong electromagnetic field localization at the trapped-mode resonance, characterized by a wide transmittance dip (low Q-factor) and near-unity reflectance. Remarkable stability is observed, with the OKE enhancement maintaining less than 5\\% variation for moderate polarization angles and tolerating random nanohole rotations that model fabrication imperfections. Compared to bound states in the continuum (BIC), the non-BIC trapped mode demonstrates superior robustness to structural disorder while achieving comparable nonlinear enhancement. These findings suggest promising applications in reflective nonlinear optics, particularly for high harmonic generation and polarization-insensitive photonic devices.         ",

    "abstract": "           Chiral responses in electromagnetic metasurfaces are typically categorized as extrinsic, resulting from asymmetric interactions between the structure and incident waves, and intrinsic, arising from three-dimensional symmetry breaking of the unit cell. However, most existing metasurface designs target only one type of chirality and lack a unified, continuously tunable platform for broader chiroptical control. To address this limitation, the designed kirigami-based flexible metasurface is proposed for dynamic, continuous modulation of chirality, which expands the control scope to both extrinsic and intrinsic chiral responses within a single, reconfigurable platform. Initially, the unfolded metasurface exhibits extrinsic chirality under oblique incidence. By introducing well-designed kirigami-based cuts and folds, the metasurface transitions from a planar and achiral configuration to a three-dimensional chiral geometry that breaks the mirror symmetry, thereby exhibiting tunable intrinsic chirality and asymmetric extrinsic chirality. As the folding angle increases, the resulting deformation enables continuous tuning of the chiral response, with circular dichroism and its asymmetry under oblique incidences progressively increasing and reaching pronounced levels across the X-band. Our work provides a lightweight, easy-fabricated, and mechanically reconfigurable metasurface, which offers strong potential for future development in adaptive photonic systems and advanced chiroptical technologies.

Specifically, the grid path planning problem is mapped to the problem of finding the minimum quantum energy state. Two parallel QAOA circuits are built to simultaneously execute two solution processes, namely connectivity energy calculation and path energy calculation. A classical algorithm is employed to filter out unreasonable solutions of connectivity energy, and finally, the approximate optimal solution to the path planning problem is obtained by merging the calculation results of the two parallel circuits. The research findings indicate that by setting appropriate filter parameters, quantum states corresponding to position points with extremely low occurrence probabilities can be effectively filtered out, thereby increasing the probability of obtaining the target quantum state. Even when the circuit layer number p is only 1, the theoretical solution of the optimal path coding combination can still be found by leveraging the critical role of the filter. Compared with serial circuits, parallel circuits exhibit a significant advantage, as they can find the optimal feasible path coding combination with the highest probability.         ",

Most existing proposals either target relatively simple collective spin states, or require numerous independent and complex dissipative processes. Here, we show a surprisingly versatile scheme for many-body reservoir engineering that relies solely on fully collective single-excitation decay, augmented with local Hamiltonian terms. Crucially, all these ingredients are readily available in cavity QED setups. Our method is based on splitting the spin system into groups of sub-ensembles, and provides an easily tunable setup for stabilizing a broad family of pure, highly entangled states with closed-form analytic descriptions. Our results have immediate application to multi-ensemble quantum metrology, enabling Heisenberg-limited sensing of field gradients and curvatures. Notably, the generated states have robustness against common-mode phase noise, and only require simple Ramsey-style measurements. The same setup also allows the stabilization of entangled states in a 1D chain of spin ensembles with symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, and have a direct connection to the outputs of sequential unitary circuits. In particular, we present an efficient method for engineering the celebrated spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present a three-dimensional simulation study of silicon nanowire double quantum dots with leads, which extends beyond traditional effective-mass or quasi-1D and quasi-2D approaches typically applied to bulk or planar geometries. Using the Sentaurus QTX, we self-consistently couple a 3-D Poisson solver with two-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger solutions along the strongly confined width * thickness cross-sections normal to the transport direction, yielding bound-state energies and wavefunctions across the device cross-section. This method captures wavefunction evolution, subband formation, and valley splitting while retaining the full three-dimensional electrostatics of the device. Our results show that narrow quantum dots (width = 5 nm) provide strong confinement, enhanced valley splitting, and robust single-electron localization, whereas wider quantum dots (width = 20 nm) allow single-electron occupation at lower gate voltages but with shallower quantum wells and additional higher-order modes in the wavefunction. Importantly, the quantum dot width also plays a key role in tunnel coupling: smaller channel widths enhance wavefunction overlap across the barrier, resulting in higher tunnel coupling, whereas increasing the width reduces coupling, which eventually saturates once the width is approximately twice the plunger-gate length. By systematically varying the quantum dot width together with plunger- and barrier-gate lengths, we investigate their combined influence on the conduction-band profile and interdot coupling. Together, these simulations provide design guidelines for geometry-driven control of confinement, valley splitting, and tunnel coupling in silicon nanowire double quantum dots.         ",

Through multi-valley Monte Carlo simulations of Si (110) systems, we reveal a fundamental shift in electron transport physics at low temperatures. Phonon scattering becomes negligible, and mobility is instead dictated by a competition between remote Coulomb scattering (RCS) at low carrier densities and surface roughness scattering (SRS) at high densities. This competition creates a distinct peak in electron mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate a critical design trade-off for high-$\\kappa$ dielectrics like $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$: while enhancing gate control, they introduce strong remote phonon scattering, which can suppress mobility. These findings provide essential guidelines for the material selection and design of next-generation cryogenic nano-devices.         ",

    "abstract": "           Voltage-sensitive fluorescence imaging is widely used to image action potential waves in the heart. However, while the electrical waves trigger mechanical contraction, imaging needs to be performed with pharmacologically contraction-inhibited hearts, limiting studies of the coupling between cardiac electrophysiology and tissue mechanics. Here, we introduce a high-resolution multi-camera optical mapping system with which we image action potential waves at high resolutions across the entire ventricular surface of the beating and strongly deforming heart. We imaged intact isolated rabbit hearts inside a soccer-ball shaped imaging chamber facilitating even illumination and panoramic imaging. Using 12 high-speed cameras, ratiometric voltage-sensitive imaging, and three-dimensional (3D) multi-view motion tracking, we reconstructed the entire 3D deforming ventricular surface and performed corresponding voltage-sensitive measurements during sinus rhythm, paced rhythm, and ventricular fibrillation. Our imaging setup defines a new state-of-the-art in the field and can be used to study the heart's electromechanical physiology during health and disease at unprecedented resolutions. For instance, we measured electrical activation times and observed mechanical strain waves following electrical activation fronts during pacing, observed electromechanical vortices during ventricular fibrillation, and measured action potential duration and contractile changes in response to pharmacological blockage of potassium ion channels.

Large ring lasers employed in geodesy and fundamental physics require stability of the perimeter at or below the parts-per-billion level. We present two complementary approaches to actively control the perimeter length of such ring lasers, reaching a relative length stability of $4\\times 10^{-10}$. One of these approaches is based on a phase detection between the beat of two resonances of different longitudinal mode index and a stable local oscillator. The other approach employs a highly stable wavelength meter to measure the absolute frequency of the laser light. These methods can readily be implemented and bring the stability of heterolithic devices on par with monolithic designs.         ",

    "abstract": "           Many fields of physics use quantum Monte Carlo techniques, but struggle to estimate dynamic spectra via the analytic continuation of imaginary-time quantum Monte Carlo data. One of the most ubiquitous approaches to analytic continuation is the maximum entropy method (MEM). We supply a dual Newton optimization algorithm to be used within the MEM and provide analytic bounds for the algorithm's error. The MEM is typically used with Bryan's controversial algorithm [Rothkopf, \"Bryan's Maximum Entropy Method\" Data 5.3 (2020)]. We present new theoretical issues that are not yet in the literature. Our algorithm has all the theoretical benefits of Bryan's algorithm without these theoretical issues. We compare the MEM with Bryan's optimization to the MEM with our dual Newton optimization on test problems from lattice quantum chromodynamics and plasma physics. These comparisons show that in the presence of noise the dual Newton algorithm produces better estimates and error bars; this indicates the limits of Bryan's algorithm's applicability. We use the MEM to investigate authentic quantum Monte Carlo data for the uniform electron gas at warm dense matter conditions and further substantiate the roton-type feature in the dispersion relation.

Centrifuged molecules rotating with well-defined angular frequencies are ideal candidates to probe many-body quantum systems at the nanoscale. Because the interaction with the quantum environment increases the effective moment of inertia of the embedded molecular probes, the required rotational acceleration of the optical centrifuge must be lowered to accommodate adiabatic spinning. We demonstrate a new design of an optical centrifuge, based on the method of spectral focusing, which enables extremely low, down to zero, rotational accelerations. We discuss the potential of using such constant frequency centrifuge to investigate molecular rotation inside helium nanodroplets.         ",

For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.         ",

Here, we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then, we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for $Q$-function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.         ",
