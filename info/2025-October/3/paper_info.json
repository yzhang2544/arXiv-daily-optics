    "abstract": "           The semiconductor quantum dot (CQD) was first conceived in the 1980s as offering potential for future lasers. Following high quality solution phase synthesis of colloidal CQD (CCQD) in 1993, optical gain was first demonstrated in 2000 via stimulated emission (SE) measurements. Decades of phenomenology have given rise to a Standard Model of optical gain in CCQD based upon two assumptions: a biexciton is required to achieve optical gain, and short biexciton lifetimes limit the efficient development of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). The Standard Model predicts the solution to efficient ASE is slowing Auger recombination, a task which now consumes the CCQD field. Here, we show that the Standard Model is physically incorrect, leading to misdirected materials development. Inspection of the phenomenology reveals a Simple Model which uniquely reproduces all observed phenomena. The Simple Model provides the physical foundation for developing CCQD lasers with quantum leaps in performance, including thresholdless gain.         ",

    "abstract": "           We investigate the inverse cascade of magnetic energy in decaying, collisionless plasmas with moderate to high-$\\beta$ values via first-principles numerical simulations and analytical theory. We find that pressure-anisotropy-driven instabilities, in particular the firehose instability, suppress reconnection-driven coalescence of magnetic structures (i.e., inverse transfer) by nullifying magnetic tension. This suppression leaves such structures elongated and confined to scales comparable to the Larmor radius of the particles. The presence of a magnetic guide field of sufficient strength, or a greater scale separation between the initial size of the magnetic structures and the Larmor radius, restores the system's ability to inverse transfer magnetic energy. These results reveal that inverse energy transfer in collisionless plasmas is not guaranteed, but instead sensitively depends on magnetization. In the astrophysical context, this identifies a kinetic mechanism by which Weibel-generated seed fields may fail to merge consistently, potentially limiting their role in cosmic magnetogenesis.

    "abstract": "           Resonant field enhancement in an optical cavity is a promising pathway towards realizing optical nonlinearities at the few-photon level. This quest is hampered by inevitable narrowing of the resonant linewidth as the cavity finesse is increased, which necessitates striking a compromise between the magnitude of the field enhancement and the bandwidth over which it is harnessed. This difficulty is exacerbated for broadband entangled-photon pairs, which are typically frequency-anticorrelated, so that the two photons cannot be simultaneously admitted to a cavity except when the degenerate wavelength coincides with a cavity resonance. Here we show that introducing judicious angular dispersion into single-photon and entangled-photon states before incidence on a planar Fabry-P{\u00e9}rot (FP) cavity renders these non-classical fields omni-resonant: the entire spectrum is coupled to a single longitudinal cavity mode. Making use of a planar FP cavity of finesse $\\approx100$, resonant linewidth $\\approx0.3$~nm, and free spectral range $\\approx22$~nm in the near-infrared, we couple single-photon states and frequency-anticorrelated entangled-photon states of 20-nm bandwidth to a broadband achromatic resonance associated with a single underlying narrowband longitudinal FP-cavity mode -- thereby preserving the entangled spectral structure. In general, pre-conditioning the optical field by introducing angular dispersion enables coupling non-classical states of light to a single longitudinal cavity mode, even if the field bandwidth far exceeds the resonant linewidth, or even exceeds the cavity free-spectral-range. These results pave the way to broadband resonant interactions with non-classical states of light in photon-starved applications.         ",

The theory contains an original concept of the proper time of the earthquake source, the course of which, generally speaking, differs from the course of world time. Within the framework of the theory, a new method for processing and analyzing earthquakes has been developed. Analysis of the Tohoku earthquake demonstrated the effectiveness of the method. Three phases of relaxation of the source were discovered. In the initial phase, the deactivation coefficient, which characterizes the source as a dynamic system, is equal to zero. At the end of the initial phase, the deactivation coefficient suddenly acquires a positive value, which remains unchanged throughout the main relaxation phase. The transition from the main phase to the recovery phase is accompanied by a jump in the time derivative of the deactivation coefficient. The recovery phase differs from the initial and main phases by chaotic variations in the deactivation coefficient.

Photonic band diagrams (BDs) are a key tool to investigate light propagation into such inhomogeneous structured materials. However, computing BDs requires solving Maxwell's equations across many configurations, making it numerically expensive, especially when embedded in optimization loops for inverse design techniques, for example. To address this challenge, we introduce the first approach for BD generation based on diffusion models, with the capacity to later generalize and scale to arbitrary three dimensional structures. Our method couples a transformer encoder, which extracts contextual embeddings from the input structure, with a latent diffusion model to generate the corresponding BD. In addition, we provide insights into why transformers and diffusion models are well suited to capture the complex interference and scattering phenomena inherent to photonics, paving the way for new surrogate modeling strategies in this domain.

Colloidal lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a versatile material that can produce indistinguishable single photons quasi-deterministically at high rate. Here, we integrate single CsPbBr$_3$ QDs into an open Fabry-Perot microcavity with a nanofabricated Gaussian-shaped deformation, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation into individual cavity modes with up to 18.1 $\\pm$ 0.2 times accelerated decay, down to tens of picoseconds. By in-situ tuning of the cavity resonance, we can selectively couple a single QD to different LG modes carrying OAM and observe the spatial patterns of the generated single-photon beams emitted from the cavity.

Here we present a novel photonic Ising machine that encodes spins in random lattices while programming couplings in the momentum space of light. By introducing the Sidon set-a mathematical structure ensuring pairwise difference uniqueness - and employing the Erdos-Turan bound, we establish an optical framework in which each spin pair can be assigned a unique Jij. This approach decouples the resolution limit from hardware modulation to the spatial precision in the momentum space of light. Experimentally, we demonstrate a record-high coupling resolution of 7,038 on a simple photonic platform, surpassing previous Ising machines. Our results highlight the power of uniting discrete mathematics with momentum-space photonics, paving the way toward scalable Ising machines capable of faithfully modeling real-world optimization problems.

We present the design, simulation, and experimental demonstration of high-efficiency fiber-to-chip grating couplers for LNOS.

An advantage of these sensors over their classical counterparts is often said to be that their measurement scale factor is precisely known and highly stable. However, in practice the finite pulse duration makes the sensor scale factor dependent upon the pulse shape and sensitive to variations in control field intensity, frequency, and atomic velocity. Here, we explore the concept of a temporal pulse origin in atom interferometry, where the inertial phase response of any pulse can be parameterized using a single point in time. We show that the temporal origin permits a simple determination of the measurement scale factor and its stability against environmental perturbations. Moreover, the temporal origin can be treated as a tunable parameter in the design of tailored sequences of shaped pulses to enhance scale factor stability and minimize systematic errors. We demonstrate through simulations that this approach to pulse design can reduce overall sequence durations while increasing robustness to realistic fluctuations in control field amplitude. Our results show that the temporal pulse origin explains a broad class of systematic errors in existing devices and enables the design of short, robust pulses which we expect will improve the performance of current and next-generation interferometric quantum sensors.

However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning, creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters. Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast, robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.         ",

Demonstrating nanometer-scale patterning in a suspended geometry therefore represents an important advance.

Although biomarker detection directly in patients' blood is now possible, low-cost point-of-care tests remain a challenge, because relevant biomarkers, especially amyloid-\\beta (A$\\beta$) peptides, are small, they occur at very low concentrations, and detecting a single marker is insufficient. Here, we introduce an optical biosensor based on a nanopillar structure that employs a gold nanoparticle amplification strategy.

We also show the detection of the A$\\beta$42 and A$\\beta$40 peptides in the same channel, which is highly relevant for assessing disease progress and opens a route towards multiplexing.

    "abstract": "           We present a detailed investigation of the performance of transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters with $^{163}$Ho atoms embedded by ion implantation, as part of the HOLMES experiment aimed at neutrino mass determination. The inclusion of $^{163}$Ho atoms introduces an excess heat capacity due to a pronounced Schottky anomaly, which can affect the detector's energy resolution, signal height, and response time. We fabricated TES arrays with varying levels of $^{163}$Ho activity and characterized their performance in terms of energy resolution, decay time constants, and heat capacity. The intrinsic energy resolution was found to degrade with increasing $^{163}$Ho activity, consistent with the expected scaling of heat capacity. From the analysis, we determined the specific heat capacity of $^{163}$Ho to be $(2.9 \\pm 0.4 \\mathrm{(stat)} \\pm 0.7 \\mathrm{(sys)})$ J/K/mol at $(94 \\pm 1)$\\,mK, close to the literature values for metallic holmium. No additional long decay time constants correlated with $^{163}$Ho activity were observed, indicating that the excess heat capacity does not introduce weakly coupled thermodynamic systems. These results suggest that our present TES microcalorimeters can tolerate $^{163}$Ho activities up to approximately 5 Bq without significant performance degradation. For higher activities, reducing the TES transition temperature is necessary to maintain energy resolution. These findings provide critical insights for optimizing TES microcalorimeters for future neutrino mass experiments and other applications requiring embedded radioactive sources. The study also highlights the robustness of TES technology in handling implanted radionuclides while maintaining high-resolution performance.         ",

While typically weak, they become significant at the nanoscale, driving intense research interest in the exploitation of photon recoil to drive micro- and nanostructures. While great progress has been attained in controlling transversal degrees of freedom, three-dimensional movement remains challenging, particularly due to the impractical realization of pulling forces that oppose the direction of incident light. Here we theoretically present a novel nanomotor design that enables independent control over both transverse and longitudinal motion. This design exploits coupling between an azimuthally polarized Bessel beam and a dielectric glass cylinder to realistically achieve optical pulling forces. At the same time, asymmetric plasmonic dimers, embedded within the cylinder, provide lateral motion, through asymmetric scattering under plane wave illumination. We further demonstrate that unwanted displacements and rotations can be restrained, even at long illumination times. Our design unlocks a new degree of freedom in motion control, allowing for pulling, pushing, and lateral movement by simply tuning the polarization or switching between plane waves and Bessel beams.

The amplifier under test (DUT) is inserted in one arm of a symmetrical Mach-Zehnder interferometer, with an AOM in the other arm. We measure the phase noise of the RF beat detected at the Mach-Zehnder output. The phase noise floor of the amplifier decreases proportionally to the reciprocal of the laser power at the amplifier input, down to $-125$ $\\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=100$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$. The DUT flicker noise cannot be measured because it is lower than the background of the setup.

    "abstract": "           THz wireless communications have garnered significant attention due to their unprecedented data rates enabled by the abundant untapped spectrum. However, advanced modulation formats beyond 64-QAM remain largely unexplored, as phase errors introduced during up/down-conversion severely limit system performance. Particularly, OFDM transmission is highly susceptible to aggravated ICI induced by phase noise, undermining the orthogonality of subcarriers. While PLLs and pilot-assisted compensation can mitigate phase errors, excessive pilot overhead compromises spectral efficiency and energy consumption, and white phase noise remains unrecoverable. Therefore, quantifying phase noise tolerance is essential for practical physical layer protocols. Here, we reveal the impact of phase noise in a 64-QAM, 2048-subcarrier OFDM THz transmission system. 3{\\sigma}-error estimation is proposed to quantify phase noise tolerance, indicating an intuitive EVM threshold of approximately 5%. This threshold further delineates the trade-offs among phase noise levels, SNR requirements, and pilot overhead. Moreover, by benchmarking representative oscillators with distinct phase noise spectra, microring resonators (MRRs) are identified as indispensable enablers for low-pilot-overhead OFDM THz links operating beyond 64-QAM.

Yet oscillator phase noise becomes the dominant impairment at such high frequencies, severely limiting the reliability of high-order QAM transmission. While photonic approaches, such as microcombs, are known to realize ultralow phase noise, the quantitative level of suppression required to sustain reliable high-order QAM transmission has not been clarified. Here, phase noise is reconstructed from measured spectra and embedded into a single-carrier link model to evaluate its impact. Distinct distortion mechanisms are identified, with slow common phase error and instantaneous phase jitter, where the latter remains as the residual impairment after carrier phase recovery. We further adopt the 3{\\sigma} error criterion, which maps residual distortions onto the constellation, providing a clear and practical indicator of system robustness. The results indicate that modest improvements in oscillator stability translate into significant BER gains without proportional power increase. These findings provide intuitive tolerance of phase noise in M-QAM systems and emphasize the importance of integrating low-noise photonic oscillators such as microcombs.         ",

    "abstract": "           We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime; an asymptotic law for the jump time is established in high-amplitude bistability. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.         ",

In conventional QSCI, Slater determinants used for the wave function expansion are sampled by iteratively performing approximate wave function preparation and subsequent measurement in the computational basis, and then the subspace Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized on a classical computer. In this approach, preparation of a high-quality approximate wave function is necessary to accurately compute total energies. Here we propose a Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) to avoid this difficulty, by sampling the Slater determinants from quantum states generated by the real-time evolution of approximate wave functions. We provide numerical simulations for the lowest spin-singlet and triplet states of oligoacenes (benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene), phenylene-1,4-dinitrene, and hexa-1,2,3,4,5-pentaene. We found that the HSB-QSCI is applicable not only to molecules where the Hartree--Fock provides a good approximation of the ground state, but also to strongly correlated systems where preparing a high-quality approximate wave function is hard. Hardware demonstrations of the HSB-QSCI are also reported for carbyne molecules expressed by up to 36 qubits, using an IBM Quantum processor. The HSB-QSCI captures more than 99.18\\% of the correlation energies in the active space by considering about 1\\% of all the Slater determinants in 36 qubit systems, illustrating the ability of the proposed method to efficiently consider important electronic configurations.

Double-folded rings fall into different dynamical universality classes depending on whether the random tree-like graphs underlying the double-folding are quenched or annealed, and whether the trees can undergo unhindered Brownian motion in their spatial embedding. Locally, one can distinguish (i) repton-like mass transport around a fixed tree, (ii) the spontaneous creation and deletion of side branches, and (iii) displacements of tree node, where complementary ring segments diffuse together in space. Here we employ dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a suitable elastic lattice polymer model of double-folded, randomly branching ring polymers to explore the mesoscopic dynamics that emerge from different combinations of the above local modes in three different systems: ideal non-interacting rings, self-avoiding rings, and rings in the melt state. We observe the expected scaling regimes for ring reptation, the dynamics of double-folded rings in an array of obstacles, and Rouse-like tree dynamics as limiting cases. Of particular interest, the monomer mean-square displacements of $g_1\\sim t^{0.4}$ observed for crumpled rings with $\\nu=1/3$ are similar to the subdiffusive regime observed in bacterial chromosomes. In our analysis, we focus on the question to which extent contributions of different local dynamical modes to the emergent dynamics are simply additive. Notably, we reveal a non-trivial acceleration of the dynamics of interacting rings, when all three types of local motion are present.         ",
