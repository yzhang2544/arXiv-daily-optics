    "abstract": "           Laser-induced cavitation in liquids originates from optical breakdown processes that depend sensitively on both laser-plasma dynamics and the chemical microenvironment of the solvent. Herein, we experimentally decouple the effects of ionic strength and ion specificity on cavitation inception in aqueous electrolytes spanning neutral, acidic, and alkaline regimes. Using focused nanosecond laser pulses, we show that increasing ionic strength universally lowers the cavitation threshold by enhancing charge screening and seed-electron availability. However, under constant ionic strength, strongly asymmetric behavior emerges: acidic (hydrogen chloride, HCl) solutions inhibit cavitation, whereas alkaline (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) solutions enhance it. This asymmetry arises from hydrated-electron kinetics that depends on the ion specificity. In acidic solutions, hydronium ions act as diffusion-limited scavengers of hydrated electrons, quenching their lifetime and inhibiting avalanche ionization. In contrast, hydroxide ions reduce hydronium availability and extend electron survival, promoting more efficient plasma formation. Despite large discrepancies in breakdown thresholds, electrical conductivity remains nearly constant, demonstrating that microscopic electron chemistry, rather than bulk charge transport, governs cavitation onset. These results establish a mechanism connection between electrolyte chemistry and optical breakdown, showing that ion-specific reaction dynamics fundamentally control laser-induced cavitation in aqueous environments.

    "abstract": "           Metasurfaces -- planar arrays of subwavelength nanostructures -- are typically realized with high-index dielectrics, while low-index platforms are often dismissed for their weaker contrast. Here, we identify and experimentally verify regimes where a low-index platform (SiO$_2$) surpasses a high-index counterpart (TiO$_2$). We demonstrate that a low index suppresses higher-order Bloch modes, enabling the design of efficient devices with relaxed feature sizes. Low-index metasurfaces also offer two intrinsic advantages: a broad, well-behaved chromatic response without the need for explicit dispersion engineering, and strong tolerance to fabrication errors. We validate these features experimentally with silica metagratings, metalenses, and structured-light phase plates at $\\lambda=632\\ nm$. The metagratings reach $\\geq$50% absolute diffraction efficiency over a $200\\ nm$ bandwidth, the metalenses deliver 75% absolute diffraction efficiency with diffraction-limited performance, and the vortex phase plates achieve 80% conversion efficiency at the design wavelength and 60% with $100\\ nm$ wavelength detuning. These results delineate conditions where low-index metasurfaces outperform high-index designs, suggesting a route to scalable, broadband, fabrication error-resilient flat optics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Spatial mode sorting has come to prominence as an optical processing modality capable of saturating fundamental limits to numerous sensing tasks including wavefront sensing, coronagraphy, and superresolution imaging. But despite their promising theoretical advantages, contemporary mode sorters often feature large crosstalk, high loss, or sort modes that are poorly adapted to conventional imaging systems (e.g., Hermite- and Laguerre-Gauss). Here, we introduce an alternative architecture that sorts spatial modes natural to circularly symmetric apertures: Zernike polynomials. Using conventional optics hardware and even-order vortex phase plates, we show how to assemble a series of vortex phase filters that can in principle separate the various Zernike polynomials losslessly and without crosstalk. This idea is demonstrated via application to wavefront sensing and coronagraphy, where we propose an optical system that saturates the quantum sensitivity limits to both tasks. We expect our work to prove useful for high-contrast imaging of extrasolar planets, improving both wavefront control and coronagraph performance.         ",

    "abstract": "           When a high-power, femtosecond, circularly polarized (CP) laser pulse is incident on a micrometer-scale aperture in a solid foil target, it drives surface plasma oscillation, generating high-order harmonic vortices in the diffracted light. However, this mechanism has so far only been studied theoretically under ideal conditions. In this work, we perform numerical studies on more realistic situations. In particular, we focus on a scenario where the laser is obliquely incident on the target surface to avoid the potential damage of the optics by the reflected light. We demonstrate that increasing oblique incidence angle, reducing target thickness, and improving laser contrast can enhance the harmonic conversion efficiency. However, the generated harmonic beams may contain both Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) (vortex) and non-LG components under non-ideal conditions. We show that they can be separated by their divergence, as the vortex components has smaller diverging angle. In addition, we have performed computational analyses on the harmonic divergence angles and topological charge spectra of vortex high-order harmonics under different conditions. These high-order harmonic pure LG modes can potentially be filtered out for wide range of fundamental and applied physics researches. This study provides valuable insights for the design and implementation of future experiments.         ",

The confinement potential is not assumed a priori, but emerges as a radial effective potential, analogous to a quantum dot, geometrically induced by the torsion of the material. Starting from an effective radial equation derived in a nontrivial geometric background, we analytically solve for the energy spectrum and wave functions. These solutions are then employed to evaluate the optical absorption coefficients and refractive index changes, including both linear and third-order nonlinear contributions. The formalism incorporates the electric dipole approximation and accounts for intensity-dependent effects such as saturation and spectral shifts. Our results reveal that torsion and topological parameters significantly modify the optical response, leading to tunable resonances and nontrivial dispersive behavior.

    "abstract": "           Laser cooling of large, complex molecules is a long-standing goal, instrumental for enabling new quantum technology and precision measurements. A primary consideration for the feasibility of laser cooling, which determines the efficiency and technical requirements of the process, is the number of excited-state decay pathways leading to vibrational excitations. Therefore, the assessment of the laser-cooling potential of a molecule begins with estimate of the vibrational branching ratios of the first few electronic excited states theoretically to find the optimum cooling scheme. Such calculations, typically done within the BO and harmonic approximations, have suggested that one leading candidate for large, polyatomic molecule laser cooling, alkaline earth phenoxides, can most efficiently be laser-cooled via the third electronically excited C state. Here, we report the first detailed spectroscopic characterization of the C state in CaOPh and SrOPh. We find that nonadiabatic couplings between the A, B, and C states lead to substantial mixing, giving rise to vibronic states that enable additional decay pathways. Based on the intensity ratio of these extra decay channels, we estimate a non-adiabatic coupling strength of 0.1 cm-1. While this coupling strength is small, the large density of vibrational states available at photonic energy scales in a polyatomic molecule leads to significant mixing. Thus, this result is expected to be general for large molecules and implies that only the lowest electronic excited state should be considered when judging the suitability of a molecule for laser cooling.

The vibronic interactions, which arise due to non-adiabatic coupling between the two electronic states, mix the B,v0 state with the energetically close vibronic level A,v21v33, resulting in extra transition probability into the latter state. This state mixing is more prominent in the deuterated molecule because of the smaller energy gap between the interacting states. We model the mixing of the A and B states using the Koppel-Domcke-Cederbaum (KDC) Hamiltonian parametrized in the diabatic framework of Ichino, Gauss, and Stanton on the basis of equation-of-motion coupled-cluster calculations. The simulation attributes the observed mixing to a second-order effect mediated by linear quasi-diabatic couplings between the A-C and B-C states. Based on the measured spectra, we deduce an effective coupling strength of 0.5 cm-1. Non-adiabatic couplings between different electronic states is an important factor that should be considered in the design of laser-cooling protocols for complex molecules.         ",

    "abstract": "           In this paper, we propose the Wheatstone bridge configuration for enabling real-time and closed-loop stabilization and calibration of photonic devices integrated on chip. The measurement of the optical power propagating in a waveguide is achieved by leveraging the photo-thermal resistance variation of one of the resistors that comprise a bridge, which is either part of the waveguide or in close contact with the waveguide. The voltage generated by a monitor is applied through a processing unit to preceding actuators with a view to locking a system at the desired signal level. As all the \"resistors\" consisting of the Wheatstone bridge are placed on a single material platform in proximity to each other, the bridge is insensitive to temperature variations. Consequently, it functions exclusively as a monitor for the optical power propagating in a waveguide. Due to the high sensitivity of the monitor, automatic re-tuning of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer can be achieved with a recovery time defined by the material properties of the bridge \"resistor\". The material platform and arrangement can be implemented for both monitoring and activating the actuators, which makes the proposed system an attractive candidate for closed-loop control of optical devices. Furthermore, in contradistinction to the majority of monitors and photodetectors, which provide electrical current as an outcome of measuring an optical signal, the proposed circuit provides voltage, thereby eradicating the necessity to convert current to voltage at a later stage. This serves to firstly streamline the entire circuit and secondly contribute to a substantial diminution in the noise level in the circuit.         ",

    "abstract": "           Tunable active metasurfaces have become a major research focus in recent years. Among tuning mechanisms, all-optical coherent control stands out because it requires no material or geometric change, enabling ultrafast, low-energy, interference-based modulation of amplitude, phase, and polarization in ultrathin devices. However, when applied to phase-gradient metasurfaces, coherent control has been limited to small apertures effectively confined to a single Fresnel zone, leading to large divergence and degraded beam quality. Here we propose and numerically validate a scalable method that enables large-area coherent control. The key idea is to use coherent illumination to tune the phase gradient within each Fresnel zone while a direct search algorithm optimizes zone-by-zone parameters to meet system-level targets. Using this principle, we demonstrate continuous tuning of a large-area metasurface for continuous beam-steering without per-meta-atom phase actuation. The same framework applies broadly to continuously tunable phase-gradient optics, including varifocal metalenses, parfocal zoom metalenses, tunable axicons, and related dynamic focusing elements.

    "abstract": "           This work addresses the fabrication of transparent glass surfaces with superior water-repellence (i.e., superhydrophobicity), and related functional properties such as omniphobicity, anti-fogging and anti-icing responses. Surfaces have been processed by means of mild femtosecond laser patterning combined with the grafting of fluorinated tethered molecules. Controlling the laser scan and ablation conditions permits the fabrication of under-design grooves with cross and lineal morphologies and separations between 10 and 500 um. These patterns provide a high transparency and repellence to liquids and ice over large areas. The best performance is obtained for cross or parallel line patterned glass with microgrooves separated by 100 um and 15 um depth thanks to 5 laser scanning repetitions. These surfaces present a stable Cassie-Baxter wetting state and very low ice-adhesion strength while keeping up to 80 % of optical transmittance in the visible region. Anti-fouling tests, along with freezing and thawing cycles on these surfaces, have demonstrated a remarkable and durable self-cleaning response, even under environmentally stressful conditions. Water condensation experiments conducted under atmospheric conditions, as well as in an environmental electron scanning microscope, have revealed important issues related to the formation of supercooled water droplets. These experiments show that the patterned breakdown of surface properties effectively prevents extensive fogging and water accumulation. This feature is particularly crucial for outdoors and low temperature applications where the preservation of transparency is essential.         ",

    "abstract": "           We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\\theta_K^s$ and $\\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\\theta_K^s$ and $\\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\\theta_K^s$ and $\\theta_K^p$.         ",

We demonstrate triggering of a quantum dot (QD) single photon emission using dynamic Purcell effect induced at a frequency of several GHz by acoustic strain. To this end, InAs QDs are integrated in a hybrid photon-phonon patterned microcavity, where the density of optical states is tailored by the lateral confinement of photons in um-sized traps defined lithographically in the microcavity spacer. The single-photon character of the emission form a QD in a trap is confirmed by measuring single-photon statistics. We demonstrate modulation of the QD transition energy in a trap with a frequency up to 14 GHz by monochromatic longitudinal bulk acoustic phonons generated by piezoelectric transducers. For the modulation frequency of 5.6 GHz, corresponding to the acoustic mode of the microcavity, the QD energy is periodically shifted through a spectrally narrow confined photonic mode leading to an appreciable enhancement of the QD emission due to the dynamic Purcell effect. The platform thus enables the implementation of scalable III-V-based SPSs with on-chip tunable acoustic clocks with frequencies that can exceed several GHz under continuous wave optical excitation.

Growing evidence suggests that interfaces, grain boundaries, and amorphous phases may instead host the primary fast-ion pathways.

Quantum illumination with nonsimultaneous, phase-insensitive coincidence measurements can provide jamming resilience compared to identical measurements for classical illumination. We extend an experimentally-feasible object detection and range finding quantum illumination-based protocol to include spoofing resilience. This approach allows the system to be characterised by its experimental parameters and quantum states, rather than just its detector data. Therefore we can scope the parameter-space which provides some spoofing resilience without relying upon the prohibitive method of acquiring detector data for all combinations of the experimental parameters. We demonstrate that in certain regimes the intruder has an optimal relative detection basis angle to minimise the induced error. We also show that there are spoofing-vulnerable regimes where excessive background noise prevents any induced error, while it is still possible to perform object detection, i.e. our detectors have not been fully blinded. The sensing protocol which we describe can allow for the recognition of intrusion and the possible detection of our trustworthy return signal. Our results reinforce that quantum illumination is advantageous for spoofing resilience compared to a classical illumination-based protocol.         ",

However, the description of biologically relevant processes may require rate equations that are too complex to solve using existing methods, hindering mechanistic insights into these processes. An example of significance is co-aggregation in environments containing multiple amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide alloforms, which may play a crucial role in the biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease but whose mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we use the mathematics of symmetry to derive a general integrated rate law valid for most plausible linear self-assembly reactions. We use it in conjunction with experimental data to determine the mechanism of co-aggregation of the most physiologically abundant Abeta alloforms: Abeta42, Abeta40, Abeta38 and Abeta37 peptides. We find that Abeta42 fibril surfaces catalyze the formation of co-oligomers, which accelerate new Abeta40, Abeta38 and Abeta37 fibril formation whilst inhibiting secondary nucleation of new Abeta42 fibrils. The simplicity, accuracy and broad applicability of our general integrated rate law will enable kinetic analysis of more complex filamentous self-assembly reactions, both with and without co-aggregation.

In this study, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cells in the VSM was investigated, which exhibits a surprising phenomenon of EQE above 100%. In theory, non-infrared light incident into a solar cell can cause infrared emission. The VSM could trap the emitted infrared photons and lead to extra photoexcited carriers. The easy-to-reproduce VSM effect is thus explainable. The energy of emitted infrared photons is considered as the so-called dark energy.

    "abstract": "           Computational corrections of defocus and aberrations in optical coherence tomography (OCT) offers a promising approach to realize high-resolution imaging with deep imaging depth, but without additional high hardware costs. However, these techniques are not well understood owing to a lack of accurate theoretical models and investigation tools. The image formation theory for OCT with optical aberrations is thus formulated here. Based on this theory, a numerical simulation method is developed, and computational refocusing and computational aberration correction (CAC) methods are designed. The CAC method based on the image formation theory is applied to simulated OCT signals and OCT images of a microparticle phantom and an in vivo human retina for simultaneous multi-depth correction of systematic aberration. The numerical simulation under the effective numerical aperture of 0.2 and 1.05 um central wavelength shows that the proposed method can obtain the Strehl ratios of more than 0.8 over a $\\pm$ 100 um defocus range, while the conventional method cannot achieve this under the simulated conditions. Imaging results show that the CAC method designed based on the image formation theory can correct optical aberrations and improve the image quality more than the conventional CAC method. The proposed method improved the frequency component corresponding to the density of cone photoreceptors in OCT photoreceptor images by 1.2 to 1.4 times under the multi-depth correction. This theoretical model-based approach provides a powerful aid for understanding OCT imaging properties and processing method design.         ",

    "title": "Robust acoustic and elastic full waveform inversion by adaptive Tikhonov-TV regularization",
    "abstract": "           Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a powerful wave-based imaging technique, but its inherent ill-posedness and non-convexity lead to local minima and poor convergence. Regularization methods stabilize FWI by incorporating prior information and enforcing structural constraints like smooth variations or piecewise-constant behavior. Among them, Tikhonov regularization promotes smoothness, while total variation (TV) regularization preserves sharp boundaries. However, in the context of FWI, we highlight two key shortcomings of these regularization methods. First, subsurface model parameters (P- and S-wave velocities, density) often exhibit complex geological formations with sharp discontinuities separating distinct layers, while parameters within each layer vary smoothly. Neither Tikhonov nor TV regularization alone can effectively constrain such piecewise-smooth structures. Second, and more critically, when the initial model is far from the true model, these regularization assumptions can lead to a local minimum. To address these issues, we propose adaptive Tikhonov-TV (TT) regularization, which decomposes the model into smooth and blocky components, enabling robust recovery of piecewise-smooth structures. Implemented within the ADMM framework, TT regularization incorporates an automated balancing strategy based on robust statistical analysis. Numerical experiments on acoustic and elastic FWI using benchmark geological models demonstrate that TT regularization significantly improves convergence and reconstruction accuracy compared to Tikhonov and TV regularization when applied separately. We show that for complex models and remote initial models, both Tikhonov and TV regularization tend to converge to local minima, whereas TT regularization effectively mitigates cycle skipping through its adaptive combination of the two regularization strategies.

    "title": "DASPack: Controlled Data Compression for Distributed Acoustic Sensing",
    "abstract": "           We present DASPack, a high-performance, open-source compression tool specifically designed for distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data. As DAS becomes a key technology for real-time, high-density, and long-range monitoring in fields such as geophysics, infrastructure surveillance, and environmental sensing, the volume of collected data is rapidly increasing. Large-scale DAS deployments already generate hundreds of terabytes and are expected to increase in the coming years, making long-term storage a major challenge. Despite this urgent need, few compression methods have proven to be both practical and scalable in real-world scenarios. DASPack is a fully operational solution that consistently outperforms existing techniques for DAS data. It enables both controlled lossy and lossless compression by allowing users to choose the maximum absolute difference per datum between the original and compressed data. The compression pipeline combines wavelet transforms, linear predictive coding, and entropy coding to optimise efficiency. Our method achieves up to 3x file size reductions for strain and strain rate data in lossless mode across diverse datasets. In lossy mode, compression improves to 6x with near-perfect signal fidelity, and up to 10x is reached with acceptable signal degradation. It delivers fast throughput (100-200 MB/s using a single-thread and up to 750 MB/s using 8-threads), enabling real-time deployment even under high data rates. We validated its performance on 15 datasets from a variety of acquisition environments, demonstrating its speed, robustness, and broad applicability. DASPack provides a practical foundation for long-term, sustainable DAS data management in large-scale monitoring networks.         ",

    "abstract": "           Optical interconnects are the most promising solution to address the data-movement bottleneck in data centers. Silicon microdisks, benefiting from their compact footprint, low energy consumption, and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) capability, have emerged as an attractive and scalable platform for optical modulation. However, microdisk resonators inherently exhibit low fabrication error tolerance, limiting their practical deployment. Here, utilizing a CMOS photonics platform, we demonstrate 1.2 Tb/s of off-die bandwidth through a 64 microdisk modulator system. In addition, we develop an automated, close-looped, non-reversible, low-loss, and picometer-precision permanent wavelength tuning technique using laser trimming. The trimming technique reduces 33 % of the energy consumption needed to thermally tune the microdisk resonant wavelength. Using this technique, we achieve a fully passive, 5-channel dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM, 50 GHz spacing) transmitter. The integration of the high speed (1.2 Tb/s), low energy consumption (29 fJ/bit) and the permanent wavelength trimming lays a robust foundation for next-generation optical interconnect systems, poised to facilitate scaling of future AI and computing hardware.

    "abstract": "           Purpose: Inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) effect reflects dipolar order with a dipolar relaxation time ($T_{1D}$), specific to motion-restricted macromolecules. We aim to quantify $T_{1D}$ using spin-lock MRI implemented with a novel rotary-echo sequence. Methods: In proposed method, we defined a relaxation rate $R_{dosl}$ that is specific to dipolar order and obtained as the difference of dual-frequency $R_{1rho}^{dual}$ relaxation and single-frequency $R_{1rho}^{single}$ relaxation. A novel rotary-echo spin-lock sequence was developed to enable dual-frequency acquisition. We derive the framework to estimate $T_{1D}$ from $R_{dosl}$ under macromolecular pool fraction (MPF) map constraints. The proposed approach was validated via Bloch-McConnell-Provotorov simulation, phantom studies, and in-vivo white matter studies on a 3T scanner. Results: Simulations demonstrated that $R_{dosl}$ exhibits an approximately linear relationship with $T_{1D}$. Phantom experiments showed robust ihMT contrast in $R_{dosl}$ and confirmed the feasibility and reliability of $T_{1D}$ quantification via $R_{dosl}$. In vivo white-matter studies further supported the clinical potential of this $T_{1D}$ mapping approach. Conclusion: We propose a novel, clinical feasible method for $T_{1D}$ quantification based on spin-lock MRI. This method requires substantially fewer contrast-prepared images compared to the conventional $T_{1D}$ quantification approach. This technique provides a promising pathway for robust MPF and $T_{1D}$ quantification in a single rapid scan with reduced confounds.         ",

The radio frequency that creates the optical sidebands for CPT quickly switches between two magnetic sensitive transitions and the magnetic field is extrapolated from the difference of the center frequencies of the magnetic resonances. Light shifts and common drifts like collisional shifts can be suppressed through careful choice of measured resonances and we show the light shift reduction by more than a factor of 20 compared to excitation with circular polarized light.

We investigate a minimal system consisting of two nearly identical coupled Kerr microresonators, each operating in the soliton regime and driven by a separate coherent beam, and analyze the mechanisms that govern their soliton interactions. In the weak-coupling regime, the system supports multiple soliton clusters characterized by distinct soliton separations and stability. Numerical simulations indicate that asymmetric perturbations can alter soliton separations or destroy these states, while the imposed pump phase difference plays a key role in cluster selection. Together, these findings highlight previously unexplored regimes of dissipative soliton organization and suggest new strategies for controlling soliton ensembles in integrated photonic platforms.

    "title": "Quantum matched filtering: breaking time-energy separability by 12 orders of magnitude",
    "abstract": "           Detection of signals buried in noise is the major challenge for sensing. Classically, the optimal detector is a matched filter, whose sensitivity meets the classical limit of correlation between the filter target and the measured signal within the noise. For classical signals, the correlation is limited by the separability criterion in frequency-time. Quantum states, however are not necessarily separable, and the correlation between entangled particles can surpass the classical limits. Specifically, time-energy entangled photons can be simultaneously correlated in time difference and frequency sum with no minimum limit, potentially leading to a drastic enhancement of sensitivity for diversified sensing applications. Yet, to enjoy this quantum enhancement, a unique, global detector is needed that can recover the complete information of entanglement in a single shot, i.e. measure the combined correlated variables of time-difference and frequency-sum without measuring the individual frequencies or times. Such a global measurement could, in principle, be realized using the reverse disentangling interaction, such as sum-frequency generation (SFG), but nonlinear interactions at the single-photon level have long been prohibitively inefficient, significantly restricting practical implementations. Here we overcome this barrier: We measure simultaneously and efficiently both the frequency-sum (SFG spectrum) and the time-difference (relative group delay/dispersion) by stimulating the SFG recombination with a strong pump. We generate biphotons with extreme time-energy entanglement (octave-spanning spectrum of 113THz) and measure a relative uncertainty of time-difference and frequency-sum that violates the classical separability bound by >12 orders of magnitude. Our experiment and supporting theory pave the way for quantum sensing applications, such as quantum illumination (radar).         ",

    "abstract": "           Micro- and nanothermometry enable precise temperature monitoring and control at the micro- and nanoscale, and have become essential diagnostic tools in applications ranging from high-power microelectronics to biosensing and nanomedicine. Most existing techniques rely on secondary micro- and nanothermometers that require individual calibration of each sensor, ideally both off- and in-situ, before use. We present an alternative approach that overcomes this limitation by employing fluorescent diamonds containing silicon-vacancy centers, where the thermo-sensitive physical quantities are the centers' photoluminescence and the diamond host's Raman signals. The photoluminescence and Raman data are analyzed using two multi-feature regression algorithms that leverage a minimal number of calibration diamonds and temperature set points to predict the temperature of previously unseen diamonds. Using this approach, the models achieve accuracies as low as 0.7 K, resolutions down to 0.6 K Hz$^{-1/2}$, and sensitivity as high as 0.04 K$^{-1}$. These correspond to improvements of roughly 70 percent (over threefold) in accuracy, 50 percent (twofold) in resolution, and 567 percent (sevenfold) in sensitivity compared with traditional single-feature models. Our approach is particularly suited to applications where pre-deployment calibration of every thermosensor is impractical, and it is generalizable to any thermometry platform with two or more simultaneously measurable temperature-dependent observables.

CHRONOS combines a ring-cavity Sagnac interferometer with torsion-bar test masses to realize the first quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of angular momentum in a macroscopic system. By implementing a speed-meter readout in the rotational degree of freedom, CHRONOS coherently cancels quantum radiation-pressure noise and enables sub-Hz observations. We show that detuned power recycling and cavity-length optimization can simultaneously relax technical requirements on both torsion bars and speed meters. Assuming a realistic optical design with a 1m torsion bar, we estimate strain sensitivities of $h \\simeq 1 \\times 10^{-18}\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1Hz for detectors with arm lengths of 2.5m, 40m, and 300m.

Furthermore, CHRONOS enables prompt detection of gravity-gradient signals from magnitude-5.5 earthquakes even with a 2.5m prototype. CHRONOS thus opens new opportunities for quantum-limited geophysical observation and multi-band, multi-messenger gravitational-wave astronomy.         ",
