    "abstract": "           Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) based quantum sensors hold great potential for real-time single-cell sensing with far-reaching applications in fundamental biology and medical diagnostics. Although highly sensitive, the mapping of quantum measurements onto cellular physiological states has remained an exceptional challenge. Here we introduce a novel quantum sensing modality capable of detecting changes in cellular activity. Our approach is based on the detection of environment-induced charge depletion within an individual particle that, owing to a previously unaccounted transverse dipole term, induces systematic shifts in the zero-field splitting (ZFS). Importantly, these charge-induced shifts serve as a reliable indicator for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammatory response in macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that surface modification of our diamond nanoprobes effectively suppresses these environment-induced ZFS shifts, providing an important tool for differentiating electrostatic shifts caused by the environment from other unrelated effects, such as temperature variations. Notably, this surface modification also leads to significant reductions in particle-induced toxicity and inflammation. Our findings shed light on systematic drifts and sensitivity limits of NV spectroscopy in a biological environment with ramification on the critical discussion surrounding single-cell thermogenesis. Notably, this work establishes the foundation for a novel sensing modality capable of probing complex cellular processes through straightforward physical measurements.         ",

    "abstract": "           Bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) modeling expands the spatial and temporal scales of molecular simulation by seeking a reduced, thermodynamically consistent representation of an atomistic model. Developments in CG theory have largely focused on CG modeling of atomistic systems which behave classically, while CG modeling of quantum systems has remained largely unexplored. We present in this work two fundamental advances in particle-based, bottom-up CG theory for systems obeying quantum statistical mechanics. We first expand the bottom-up CG formalism to include indistinguishable quantum particles, including bosons and fermions. We next introduce a variational optimization procedure for CG model parameterization which is founded on the relative entropy minimization (REM) principle and then bridge the classical and quantum REM methods through a semiclassical expansion in terms of the Feynman path centroid. We provide numerical examples of REM CG models of distinguishable and indistinguishable quantum systems, including as examples a harmonically trapped bosonic system and liquid water. The theoretical results presented here constitute a means to accelerate simulating thermal quantum systems ranging from distinguishable particle systems at higher temperatures to quantum indistinguishable particle systems at lower temperatures.

Here we explore the host-dependence of the nuclear clock frequency, focusing on the isomer shift induced by the difference in the nuclear charge distribution between the ground and excited nuclear states. We combine relativistic many-body methods of atomic structure with periodic density functional theory to evaluate the isomer shifts in solid-state hosts.

However, it remains challenging to incorporate LCs into integrated photonics and the operating wavelength has been limited to near infrared. Here, we demonstrate a liquid-crystal-based phase shifter operating at 780 nm, a relevant wavelength for cold atom-based quantum applications, by incorporating nematic LCs (E7) into a silicon nitride (SiN) ring resonator.

While multi-physics finite-element models effectively capture central streaming, they exhibit subtle differences and perform poorly in capturing flow in the side lobes.

    "abstract": "           Stoichiometric silicon nitride has emerged as a widely used integrated photonic material owing to its high index of refraction, nonlinear optical properties, and broad transparency window spanning visible to mid-IR frequencies. However, silicon nitride is generally more resistant to reactive ion etching than are typical etch masks made of polymer-based resist. This necessitates resist layers that are significantly thicker than the silicon nitride and results in mask patterns which are tall and narrow. These high-aspect-ratio patterns inhibit the plasma transport of reactive ion etching, which leads to difficulties in accurately reproducing dimensions and creating well-defined, vertical waveguide sidewalls. In this work, we overcome these challenges by developing a metallic etch mask that provides a 30:1 nitride-to-metal etch rate ratio, representing a near 20-fold reduction in the required mask thickness. We demonstrate the quality of this technique by etching microring resonators with near-vertical waveguide sidewalls and intrinsic quality factors of over 1 million. Leveraging the low optical loss of our resonators, we generate optical frequency combs with more than an octave of bandwidth and dual dispersive waves. These results establish metal lift-off as a viable and easy-to-implement technique capable of producing low optical loss waveguides.         ",

This work explores the ability of RTD spiking neurons to deliver information encoding mechanisms analogous to those observed in biological neurons, specifically spike firing rate and spike latency encoding. We also report detailed experimental and numerical studies on the impact that the RTD mesa radius and circuit inductance and capacitance have on its spiking properties, providing useful information for future design of RTD-based neural networks optimised for ultrafast (>GHz rate) processing capabilities. Finally, we showcase the application of spike rate encoding in RTD neurons for the ultrafast reconstruction of a eight-level amplitude signal, effectively filtering out the noise.         ",

    "abstract": "           Throughout history, the development of novel technologies for long-distance communications has had profound influences on societal progress. Landmark scientific discoveries have enabled the transition from short message transmissions via single-wire electrical telegraphs to voice communications through coaxial cables, and ultimately to the optical fibres that powered the internet revolution. Central to these advancements was the invention of novel waveguides to transport electromagnetic waves with lower attenuation over broader spectral ranges. In the past four decades, despite extensive research, the spectral bandwidth and attenuation of silica-based telecommunication fibres have remained relatively unchanged. In this work, we report an optical waveguide with an unprecedented bandwidth and attenuation. Its measured loss reaches 0.091 dB/km at 1550 nm and remains below 0.2 dB/km over 66 THz, substantially better than the 0.14 dB/km and 26 THz achievable with existing technology. Our innovative, microstructured optical fibre replaces the traditional glass core with air, employing a meticulously engineered tubular glass structure to guide light. This approach not only reduces attenuation and other signal degradation phenomena, but it also increases transmission speeds by 50%. Furthermore, it theoretically enables further loss reductions and operation at wavelengths where broader bandwidth amplifiers exist, potentially heralding a new era in long-distance communications.

However, lithium whiskers can form in the early stages of electroplating. These whiskers lead to low Coulombic efficiency due to isolated lithium formation during stripping. The mechanism of whisker formation is not fully understood, and different mechanisms are proposed in the literature. Herein, we computationally explore a stress-driven extrusion mechanism through cracks in the solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI), which explains the experimentally observed root growth of lithium whiskers. We model the extrusion as a flow of a power-law Herschel-Bulkley fluid parametrized by the experimental power-law creep behavior of lithium, which results in the typical one-dimensional whisker shape. Consequently, in competition with SEI self-healing, SEI cracking determines the emergence of whiskers, giving a simple rule of thumb to avoid whisker formation in liquid electrolytes.         ",

Still, there is much to be improved within the domain of photonic nonlinear activation functions, as the programmable, all-optical, energy-efficient nonlinearities remain beyond the grasp of today's state of the art. In this paper, we address the issue at hand and propose a novel approach in the realization of high-performing all-optical photonic activations. Through simulations and experiments, we show that Fabry-Perot laser diodes (FP-LDs) exhibit richness and high programmability of their nonlinear response to input optical pulses with widths as low as 25 ps. We demonstrate a variety of sigmoid-like and inverted PReLU-like trends to be used as all-optical activation functions in photonic neural networks, testing their performance in stringent, real-life training scenarios with randomized data patterns at repetition rates up to 10 GHz. The programmability of activations is shown using a multitude of experimental operating parameters, among which we highlight the power variation of an additional continuous wave laser, injected into the FP-LD, enriching our approach with all-optical control of all-optical activations. With very low static power consumption of our active element, we achieve a record-breaking energy draw on the order of pJ to hundreds of fJ per nonlinear operation.         ",

    "abstract": "           Acoustic pressure nodes in acoustophoretic devices are crucial for applications in tissue engineering, cell analysis, and particle trapping. Typically, a single primary node forms at the half-wavelength resonance condition, while its shape and position are constrained by the dimensions of the channel. The generation of additional nodes, along with control over their positions and shapes, is highly desirable in biomedical applications and could significantly enhance particle manipulation capabilities. To explore this potential, we numerically demonstrate the formation of additional, complex-shaped, nodes alongside the primary one, by a circular scatterer within a rectangular cavity. We identify three distinct types: ring, protuberant, and crescent nodes, whose formation depends on the size of the scatterer, its placement in the middle of the channel, and its corresponding resonant frequency. The key mechanism behind this formation is the enhancement of internal reflections, increasing destructive interference to promote node generation. To achieve this, we employ three key concepts: using a low-aspect ratio channel, positioning a rigid circular scatterer in the middle of the channel, and modeling all surfaces as perfect reflectors. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of the scatterer on acoustic pressure and quality factor, which is defined as the ratio of stored acoustic energy to damped acoustic energy per cycle. We show that additional nodes emerge in the presence of a scatterer, but they come at the cost of reduced acoustic pressure and energy in the channel. In summary, this study provides information on generating complex nodes in a standing wave acoustic cavity at the fundamental frequency, which has numerous applications for particle manipulation in acoustofluidic devices.

An important approach to controlling and optimizing ultra-intense laser interactions involves gathering large data sets and using this data to train statistical and machine learning models. In this paper we describe experimental efforts to accelerate electrons and protons to $\\sim$MeV energies with this goal in mind. These experiments involve a 1 kHz repetition rate ultra-intense laser system with $\\sim$10mJ per shot, a peak intensity near $5 \\times 10^{18}$ W/cm$^{2}$, and a \"liquid leaf\" target. Improvements to the data acquisition capabilities of this laser system greatly aided this investigation. Generally, we find that the trained models were very effective for controlling the numbers of MeV electrons ejected. The models were less successful at shifting the energy range of ejected electrons. Simultaneous control of the numbers of $\\sim$MeV electrons and the energy range will be the subject of future experimentation using this platform.         ",

    "abstract": "           Non-Markovian dynamics go beyond the Markovian approximation by capturing memory effects and information backflow in open quantum systems, which are crucial for describing realistic physical processes. In this work, we study the exact non-Markovian dynamics of a driven cavity coupled to an anisotropic three-dimensional photonic-crystal environment via counterrotating-wave interactions. We derive an exact analytical expression for the cavity amplitude satisfying the integro-differential equation, which includes the contributions of the bound states outside the continuum and the dissipative parts with the continuum spectrum. Based on the characteristic function method, we derive the exact non-Markovian master equation for the cavity, which contributes to the gain of the cavity. We give the physical origin of non-Markovian gain in the presence of bound states in the system consisting of cavity and environment, which has no Markovian counterparts due to the nonexponential gain in the non-Markovian structured environment. We find that three different types of bound states can be formed in the system, containing one bound state with no inversion of photon number, two bound states with the periodic equal-amplitude oscillation, and the gain with two complex roots without the bound states formation. We derive a current equation including the source from the driving field, the transient current induced by the change in the number of photons, and the two-photon current caused by the counterrotating-wave term. The results are compared with those given by the rotating-wave interactions and extended to a more general quantum network involving an arbitrary number of coupled cavities. Our findings may pave the way for a deeper understanding of non-Markovian dynamics with gain in quantum networks involving counterrotating-wave effects.         ",

By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helicoidal background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \\(10^{-16}\\) to \\(10^{-13}\\) seconds as the helicoidal pitch (\\(a\\)) varies from \\(10^3\\) nanometers to \\(1\\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helicoidal graphene for various nanophotonic applications.

The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term quantum hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of reference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and unitary coupled-cluster with single and double excitations. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.         ",

    "abstract": "           Silicon (Si) is the primary donor dopant in gallium nitride (GaN), introduced through epitaxial growth or ion implantation. However, precise control over Si diffusion remains a critical challenge for high-performance device applications. This study investigates Si diffusion mechanisms in bulk GaN using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, supported by ultra-high-pressure annealing (UHPA) experiments. Vacancy-mediated diffusion pathways were analyzed using the SIESTA code, with minimum energy paths (MEPs) and activation barriers determined via the nudged elastic band (NEB) method. The results indicate that Si diffusion barriers vary with crystallographic direction, with the lowest barrier of 3.2 eV along [11-20] and the highest barrier of ~9.9 eV along [1-100], rendering diffusion in this direction highly improbable. Alternative diffusion mechanisms, including direct exchange and ring-like migration, exhibit prohibitively high barriers ($>$12 eV). Phonon calculations confirm that temperature-induced reductions in effective diffusion barriers are minimal. Experimental validation using SIMS analysis on Si-implanted GaN samples subjected to UHPA (1450\u00b0C, 1 GPa) confirms negligible Si diffusion under these extreme conditions. These findings resolve inconsistencies in prior reports and establish that Si-doped GaN remains highly stable, ensuring reliable doping profiles for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications.

We investigate CAP generation in the Janus-like layered alloy tungsten sulfide selenide (WS$_x$Se$_{1-x}$, hereafter WSSe). Employing high-fluence photoexcitation at 400 nm combined with ultrafast transient reflection spectroscopy, we capture the carrier-lattice dynamics governed by a cascade of processes including rapid exciton formation, phonon recycling, and thermoelastic deformation. These phenomena precede the emergence of a robust CAP mode at 27 GHz. Notably, the CAP amplitude in WSSe substantially exceeds that observed in the symmetric parent crystals WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$, which we attribute to an enhanced coupling mediated by a built-in out-of-plane electric field arising from the inversion asymmetry of the WSSe alloy. Furthermore, the implementation of a tailored two-pulse excitation sequence enables optical control of the CAP, underscoring the potential of WSSe and related Janus-like layered alloys as versatile building blocks in optomechanical and nanoacoustic device applications.

For this purpose, we consider the classic example of the H$_4$ molecule in a rectangular geometry. Our results are obtained on the 5000-qubit D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 quantum computer. We benchmark our quantum annealing results with full configuration interaction (FCI) as well as with those obtained using simulated annealing. We find that we can predict avoided crossings within about 1.2% of the FCI value on real quantum hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Since the QAE algorithm provides information on the wave function as its output, we also check the quality of the computed wave function by calculating the fidelity, and find it to be 99.886%. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the QAE algorithm relative to its gate-based NISQ algorithm counterpart, the celebrated Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).

    "abstract": "           As dual combs play a significant role in numerous high-precision measurements, their efficient generation has been widely researched. Although the single-cavity dual-comb generation can avoid the complex active stabilization methods, achieving and maintaining stable dual-comb mode locking within a single cavity remains a critical challenge. To break through this constraint, a two-part evaluation criterion containing a fitness function and a CNN-Transformer network is employed to achieve mode locking and classify the dual-comb mode-locked state. Simulated time-stretch dispersive Fourier transform (DFT) spectra are used as datasets, which simplifies the optimization process and does not rely on specific experimental data. A developed evolutionary algorithm (EA) for paddle-based motorized polarization controllers (MPCs) is proposed, enabling the intelligent attainment of dual-comb mode-locked states. A real-time library stores fitness and MPC angles, facilitating mode-locked state achievement within 2 seconds. Finally, long term running of dual-comb mode locking is ensured by a random collision algorithm utilizing an evaluation criterion of weak soliton peaks.         ",

    "abstract": "           High-order harmonic generation (HHG) in gases has been studied for almost 40 years in many different conditions, varying the laser wavelength, intensity, focusing geometry, target design, gas species, etc. However, no systematic investigation of the effect of the pulse duration has been performed in spite of its expected impact on phase-matching of the high-order harmonics. Here, we develop a compact post-compression method based on a bulk multi-pass cell enabling tunable Fourier-limited pulse durations. We examine the HHG yield as a function of the pulse duration, ranging from 42 fs to 180 fs, while maintaining identical focusing conditions and generating medium. Our findings reveal that, for a given intensity, there exists an optimum pulse duration - not necessarily the shortest - that maximizes conversion efficiency. This optimum pulse duration increases as the intensity decreases. The experimental results are corroborated by numerical simulations, which show the dependence of HHG yield on the duration and peak intensity of the driving laser and underscore the importance of the interplay between light-matter interaction and phase-matching in the non-linear medium. Our conclusion explains why HHG could be demonstrated in 1988 with pulses as long as 40 ps and intensities of just a few $10^{13}$ W/cm${^2}$.         ",

First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. We propose to use the \\textit{a priori} knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC \\textit{in vivo} in 5 mouse brains. We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\\mu$m to 18.3 $\\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction.         ",

    "abstract": "           Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.         ",
