    "abstract": "           For many years there has been an aspiration within the community to develop curved silicon detectors for particle physics applications. We present the results from 10 x 10cm low mass support modules as a part of the \"ZeroMass\" project that aims to minimise the material budget for tracking and vertexing systems for future colliders. We use 50 {\\mu}m thick DC coupled strip sensors from Micron Semiconductor Ltd., with a carbon composite support frame. Our current module demonstrators use a radius of curvature of 15cm, typical of that used for the outer parts of large pixel systems, or the inner part of strip trackers and the outer part of large radii vertex detectors. The material budget obtained varies from an $X_0$ of 0.05\\% in the active area to 0.62\\% in the support structure, with an average of 0.28\\%. There is further scope for material budget reduction in applying the concept and methods to large instruments for future detector systems, which we also discuss.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present a quantum-in-quantum embedding strategy coupled to machine learning potentials to improve on the accuracy of quantum-classical hybrid models for the description of large molecules. In such hybrid models, relevant structural regions (such as those around reaction centers or pockets for binding of host molecules) can be described by a quantum model that is then embedded into a classical molecular-mechanics environment. However, this quantum region may become so large that only approximate electronic structure models are applicable. To then restore accuracy in the quantum description, we here introduce the concept of quantum cores within the quantum region that are amenable to accurate electronic structure models due to their limited size. Huzinaga-type projection-based embedding, for example, can deliver accurate electronic energies obtained with advanced electronic structure methods. The resulting total electronic energies are then fed into a transfer learning approach that efficiently exploits the higher-accuracy data to improve on a machine learning potential obtained for the original quantum-classical hybrid approach. We explore the potential of this approach in the context of a well-studied protein-ligand complex for which we calculate the free energy of binding using alchemical free energy and non-equilibrium switching simulations.

    "abstract": "           An attractive way to calculate nuclear quantum effects is to describe select nuclei quantum mechanically at the same level as the electrons, requiring the solution of coupled Schr\u00f6dinger equations for the electrons and the quantum nuclei. This is commonly known as the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) method, but it also has many other names. Two types of basis sets are required: a nuclear basis set is required in addition to the usual electronic basis set. In this work, we demonstrate that while existing nuclear basis sets are sufficient for NEO density-functional calculations, many sets producing proton affinities converged within 0.1 kcal/mol of the complete basis set limit, NEO calculations should always use uncontracted electronic basis sets on the quantum protons, since the contraction coefficients in typical electronic basis sets have been derived for point nuclear charge distributions. Uncontracting the basis sets on the quantized protons leads to significantly faster convergence to the basis set limit, leading to improvements of 18 kcal/mol and 10 kcal/mol in proton affinities employing double-$\\zeta$ aug-pc-1 and triple-$\\zeta$ aug-pc-2 electronic basis sets, respectively, with little effect on the computational effort. The partially uncontracted aug-pc-3 electronic basis set already affords proton affinities converged beyond 0.1 kcal/mol from the complete basis set limit. Similar results are also obtained with Dunning's correlation-consistent cc-pVXZ basis sets, as well as the Karlsruhe def2-XZP basis sets, albeit at a somewhat slower rate of convergence. As the protonic basis sets yield fully converged values, we find the protonic basis sets to be unnecessarily large for ground state density functional calculations, as the error in the protonic basis set is not balanced with that for typical electronic basis sets.

    "abstract": "           Surface polaritons play a pivotal role in enabling and controlling strong light-matter interactions at the nanoscale due to their ability to carry large momentum, thus confining light to deep subwavelength dimensions. These polaritons are supported by materials with negative real-part permittivity, such as surface-plasmon-polaritons in metals, and plasmons in graphene, for example. A promising class of materials that exhibit negative permittivity is that of polar dielectrics, which can support surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs). While SPhPs offer significantly lower losses compared to other surface polaritons, their potential has been underutilized due to their limited ability to carry large momentum. In this work, we demonstrate the experimental realization of acoustic surface-phonon-polaritons (APhPs) - a hybridized SPhPs mode that can carry large momentum. We achieve this by realizing phononic resonators in a system composed of nanometric-sized silver cubes deposited on a SiC polar dielectric. The nanocube creates a mirror image of the SPhP, forming the hybridized APhP mode. We find that the APhPs resonators can confine far-infrared radiation to extremely small mode volumes, which are almost a billion times smaller than their free-space mode-volume. Moreover, we show that owing to their inherently low losses, APhPs exhibit quality factors that are an order of magnitude greater than those of surface plasmons or graphene plasmons, surpassing values of 180. Finally, we demonstrate that the spectral response and intensity of the APhP resonators can be precisely controlled by adjusting the size and concentration of the nanocubes. Our method is general, scalable, and applicable to any polar dielectric across a broad spectrum of materials and wavelengths, opening the path for controlling and manipulating strong light-matter interactions at the nanoscale in the long-wavelength range.

Recently, inspired by the discovery of topological phases of matter, Dirac-vortex topological PCFs have been theoretically proposed with intriguing topological properties and unprecedented opportunities in optical fiber communications. However, due to the substantial challenges of fabrication and characterization, experimental demonstration of Dirac-vortex topological PCFs has thus far remained elusive. Here, we report the experimental realization of a Dirac-vortex topological PCF using the standard stack-and-draw fabrication process with silica glass capillaries. Moreover, we experimentally observe that Dirac-vortex single-polarization single-mode bounds to and propagates along the fiber core in the full communication window (1260-1675nm). Our study pushes the research frontier of PCFs and provides a new avenue to enhance their performance and functionality further.         ",

    "abstract": "           Optical force can enable precise manipulations of small particles for various applications. It is well known that an isotropic lossless dielectric sphere is only subject to forward optical force under the illumination of an electromagnetic plane wave. By using rigorous full-wave simulations, we show that such a sphere can experience a lateral optical force and an optical torque besides the conventional longitudinal force, if it spins with a constant angular velocity. The emergence of the unusual optical force and torque is attributed to the breaking of mirror and cylindrical symmetries by the spinning motion. Using the multipole expansion in source representation, we illustrate how the spinning-induced effective bi-anisotropy generates the lateral force and torque on the sphere through the interference of electric and magnetic multipoles. We also uncover the effect of Sagnac frequency splitting on the optical force and torque. The results contribute to the understanding of the optical force and torque in moving media and can be applied to realize unconventional optical manipulations of small particles.         ",

    "abstract": "           Future high-luminosity hadron collider experiments feature unprecedented levels of event pile-up and extreme radiation environments, calling for sensors capable of 4D tracking, even after significant radiation damage. To this purpose, 3D sensors represent a viable solution, since they provide excellent radiation tolerance and very good temporal resolution. In particular, owing to the uniform electric field and weighting field distributions, 3D-trench electrode sensors from the INFN TIMESPOT project have shown a temporal resolution of $\\sim$10 ps after irradiation fluences up to 1$\\times$10$^{17}$ 1-Mev n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$. In spite of the excellent performance of these sensors, 3D-trench pixel technology is not yet fully established and the fabrication yield is not yet adequate for the production of large size pixel sensors. To improve the potential of the 3D-trench concept for large-area sensors, a new batch of sensors was designed at the University of Trento and fabricated at FBK, as part of the AIDA Innova project. Besides introducing some process improvements, this batch includes two different sensor variants: the standard one with continuous ohmic trenches, and a modified one with dashed ohmic trenches. On-wafer electrical test results show that most of the sensors have low leakage current and high breakdown voltage. Moreover, the fabrication yield for the new design variant is higher than that of the standard design.         ",

    "abstract": "           Two-dimensional hexagonal materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit valley degrees of freedom, offering fascinating potential for valley-based quantum computing and optoelectronics. In nonlinear optics, the K and K' valleys provide excitation resonances that can be used for ultrafast control of excitons, Bloch oscillations, and Floquet physics. Under intense laser fields, however, the role of coherent carrier dynamics away from the K/K' valleys is largely unexplored. In this study, we observe quantum interferences in high harmonic generation from monolayer $WS_2$ as laser fields drive electrons from the valleys across the full Brillouin zone. In the perturbative regime, interband resonances at the valleys enhance high harmonic generation through multi-photon excitations. In the strong-field regime, the high harmonic spectrum is sensitively controlled by light-driven quantum interferences between the interband valley resonances and intraband currents originating from electrons occupying various points in the Brillouin zone, also away from K/K' valleys such as $\\Gamma$ and M. Our experimental observations are in strong agreement with quantum simulations, validating their interpretation. This work proposes new routes for harnessing laser-driven quantum interference in two-dimensional hexagonal systems and all-optical techniques to occupy and read-out electronic structures in the full Brillouin zone via strong-field nonlinear optics, advancing quantum technologies.

Till now, experimental investigations mainly focus on the single layer device, i.e., two or more layers of photonic crystal patterns are merged and etched in a single layer of material. By comparison, twisted photonic crystal with multilayer materials raises challenges in the nanofabrication technology, because the growth of upper layer material usually requires a smooth bottom layer without nanostructures. Hereby, we fabricate twisted heterobilayer photonic crystal in the graphite/Si$_3$N$_4$ heterostructure. We use dry transfer method to stack the graphite on top of bottom Si$_3$N$_4$ with pre-etched photonic crystal patterns. Selective dry etching recipes are used to etch two photonic crystal layers individually, which improves the quality and accuracy in alignment. The cavity photonic mode at the visible wavelength $\\sim 700$ nm arsing from the moir\u00e9 site is clearly observed in experiment. These results reveal the experimental diagram of heterobilayer nanophotonic devices and open the way to design flexibility and control of photons in new degrees of freedom.         ",

In the present work, we identify the origin of this deficiency and devise a strategy to obtain accurate closed-form expressions also in cases challenging the conventional (leading order) paraxial beam model.

Experimental results reveal that the chaos lidar achieves an accuracy better than 0.9 cm and a precision better than 0.3 cm for ranging distances up to 300 cm. In addition, it is found that a minimum signal-to-noise ratio of only 1 dB is required to sustain both sub-cm accuracy and sub-cm precision.

The analyses of Bland-Altman, Pearson correlation and reasonability were performed to assess the degree of agreement, linear correlation and reasonability between the two quantification methods. Results: Fifteen healthy volunteers (12 females and 3 males, age range: 21-35 years, mean age/standard deviation = 27.4/3.9 years) were recruited. The analyses of Bland-Altman, Pearson correlation and reasonability showed high to good consistency and very strong to moderate correlation between the two methods for quantification of total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), total choline (tCho), and inositol (Ins) (relative half interval of limits of agreement = 3.04%, 9.3%, and 18.5%, respectively; Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.775, 0.927, and 0.469, respectively). In addition, quantification results of QNet are more likely to be closer to the previous reported average values than those of LCModel. Conclusion: There were high or good degrees of consistency between the quantification results of QNet and LCModel for tNAA, tCho, and Ins, and QNet generally has more reasonable quantification than LCModel.

    "abstract": "           The precise derivation of physical quantities like temperature or pressure at arbitrary locations is useful in numerous contexts, e.g. medical procedures or industrial process engineering. The novel sensor technology of magneto-mechanical resonators (MMR), based on the interaction of a rotor and stator permanent magnet, allows for the combined tracking of the sensor position and orientation while simultaneously sensing an external measurand. Thereby, the quantity is coupled to the torsional oscillation frequency, e.g. by varying the magnet distance. In this paper, we analyze the (deflection angle-independent) natural frequency dependency of MMR sensors on the rotor-stator distance, and evaluate the performance of theoretical models. The presented sensors incorporate magnets of spherical and/or cylindrical geometry. We find the distance-frequency relationship to be well described by an adapted dipole model accounting for material and manufacturing uncertainties. Their combined effect can be compensated by an adjustment of a single parameter which drives the median model deviation generally below 0.2 %. Our depicted methods and results are important for the design and calibration process of new sensor types utilizing the MMR technique         ",

We observe frequency up and down conversion of 4 GHz microwaves through the metamaterials, which is caused by the temporal modulation of permeability in the Py layer. Moreover, the efficiency of the up-conversion to a higher frequency is much larger than that of the down conversion to a lower frequency. These experimental results are reproduced well via numerical calculation, verifying that the significant up-conversion efficiency is traced back to nonlinear magnetization dynamics in the metamaterials. The present study opens a door to microwave sources toward the 6th-generation mobile communication system, four-dimensional metamaterials with spatio-temporal modulation, and nonlinear spintronics.

Our method uses a field vector measurement at a single point in space and is thus compatible with a sensor volume that is arbitrarily small compared to the carrier wavelength.

Despite the Kerr effect`s ultrafast response, its inherently weak nonlinearity has hindered practical applications. Here, we explore free-electron-induced Kerr nonlinearities in all-semiconductor waveguides, revealing that longitudinal bulk plasmons (inherently nonlocal excitations) can generate exceptionally strong Kerr nonlinearities. We specifically develop a nonlinear eigenmode analysis integrated with semiclassical hydrodynamic theory to compute the linear and nonlinear optical responses originating from the quantum behavior of free electrons in heavily doped semiconductors. These waveguides achieve ultrahigh nonlinear coefficients exceeding 10$^7$ W$^{-1}$km$^{-1}$ and support long-propagating modes with propagation distances over 100 $\\mu$m. Additionally, we confirm the robustness of the nonlinear response under realistic conditions by considering viscoelastic and nonlinear damping mechanisms. Finally, we implement our all-semiconductor waveguides in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, demonstrating efficient nonlinear modulation of the transmittance spectrum via the free-electron Kerr effect. This work evidences the transformative potential of free-electron nonlinearities in heavily doped semiconductors for photonic integrated circuits, paving the way for scalable on-chip nonlinear nanophotonic systems.

Itinerant phonons in quantum acoustics, combined with superconducting qubits, offer a compelling alternative to the quantum optics approach. Here we demonstrate key advances in the ability to manipulate and measure acoustic phonon quantum states: First, we demonstrate deterministic phase control of itinerant one- and two-phonon qubit states, measured using an acoustic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We implement phonon phase control using the frequency-dependent scattering of phonon states from a superconducting transmon qubit. The acoustic interferometer used to measure the resulting phonon phase achieves a noise-floor-limited Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference visibility of 98.1%, representing a significant improvement over our previous demonstration. Additionally, we propose and implement a multi-phonon detection scheme that enables coherent conversion between itinerant one- and two-phonon Fock states and transmon qutrit states, transforming for example the Hong-Ou-Mandel two-phonon entangled output state $|02\\rangle - |20\\rangle$ into the entangled state of two transmons. The tight integration of quantum acoustics with superconducting circuits native to our implementation promises further advances, including deterministic phonon quantum gates with direct applications to quantum computing.

Based on our generic formulas and symmetry analysis, we find that in $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets, it is the quantum metric, i.e., the real part of the quantum geometry, that induces MOEs. Combining a tight-binding model and first-principles calculations, we confirm this observation by showing MOEs in the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnet. Our work demonstrates that $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets previously thought to lack MOEs can indeed exhibit MOEs and greatly broaden the research on MOEs.         ",

Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning once on two separate days within one week (one session per day, each session including two proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) scans with no more than a 5-minute interval between scans (no off-bed activity)) on each machine. were analyzed for reliability of within- and between- sessions using the coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and for reproducibility of across the machines using correlation coefficient.

When it comes to the reproducibility across the three scanners, all Pearson correlation coefficients across the three machines approached 1 with most around 0.9, and majority demonstrated statistical significance (P<0.01).

    "abstract": "           Orbital magnetization, a key property arising from the orbital motion of electrons, plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic behavior of molecules and solids. Despite its straightforward calculation in finite systems, the computation in periodic systems poses challenges due to the ill-defined position operator and surface current contributions. The modern theory of orbital magnetization, implemented in the Density Functional Theory (DFT) framework, offers an accurate solution via the \"converse approach.\" Here, we introduce QE-CONVERSE, a refactored, modular implementation of this method, replacing outdated routines from Quantum ESPRESSO (version 3.2). QE-CONVERSE integrates modern computational libraries like scaLAPACK and ELPA, enhancing scalability, especially for large supercell calculations. This work focuses on providing the community with a reliable, accurate orbital magnetization package for properties such as Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) g-tensors and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, particularly where perturbative methods fail. We demonstrate QE-CONVERSE's effectiveness with benchmark cases, including the NMR shifts of ${}^{27}$Al in alumina and ${}^{17}$O and ${}^{29}$Si in $\\alpha$-quartz, as well as the EPR g-tensor for $_{ }^{n}\\Sigma(n\\geq 2)$ radicals and nitrogen defects in silicon. Results show excellent agreement with theoretical and experimental data, with improved accuracy in EPR calculations over linear response methods.

    "abstract": "           Optical solitons classically are stationary solutions of the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. We perform a quantum field theoretic treatment by quantising a linearised fluctuation field around the classical soliton solution which can be seen as providing a background spacetime for the field. The linearised fluctuation modifies the soliton background, which is often neglected, reminiscent of the nondepleted-pump approximation. Going beyond this approximation and by using a number-conserving Bogoliubov approach, we find unstable modes that grow as the soliton propagates. Eventually, these unstable modes induce a considerable (backreaction) effect in the soliton. We calculate the backreaction in the classical field fully analytically in the leading second order. The result is a quadratic local decrease of the soliton photon number in propagation due to the backreaction effect of the unstable mode. Provided the initial pulse is close to the classical soliton solution, the unstable mode contributions always become dominant. We also consider practical scenarios for observing this quantum-induced soliton distortion, in the spectral domain. The backreaction, which we expect to be present in bright and dark, discrete and continuous solitons and other nonlinear pulses plays an important role in future optical analogue gravity experiments, for soliton lasers, and optical communications.

These metasurfaces are typically highly ordered and fabricated with precision using expensive tools. However, the inherent imperfections in large-scale nanophotonic devices, along with recent advances in bottom-up nanofabrication techniques and design strategies, have highlighted the potential benefits of incorporating disorder to achieve specific optical functionalities. This review offers an overview of the key theoretical, numerical, and experimental aspects related to the exploration of disordered optical metasurfaces. It introduces fundamental concepts of light scattering by disordered metasurfaces and outlines theoretical and numerical methodologies for analyzing their optical behavior. Various fabrication techniques are discussed, highlighting the types of disorder they deliver and their achievable precision level. The review also explores critical applications of disordered optical metasurfaces, such as light manipulation in thin film materials and the design of structural colors and visual appearances. Finally, the article offers perspectives on the burgeoning future research in this field. Disordered optical metasurfaces offer a promising alternative to their ordered counterparts, often delivering unique functionalities or enhanced performance.

    "abstract": "           Structure determination is a key application of XFELs and 4th generation synchrotron sources, particularly using the coherent and pulsed X-ray radiation from X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL). Scientific interest focuses on understanding the physical, biological, and chemical properties of samples at the nanometer scale. The X-rays from XFELs enable Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI), where coherent X-rays irradiate a sample, and a far-field diffraction pattern is captured by an imaging detector. By the nature of the underlying physics, the resolution, at which the sample can be probed with the CXDI technique, is limited by the wavelength of the X-ray radiation and the exposure time if a detector can record the diffraction pattern to very large scattering angles. The resolution that can be achieved under real experimental conditions, depends strongly on additional parameters. The Shannon pixel size, linked to the detector resolution, the coherent dose that can be deposited in the sample without changing its structure, the image contrast, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected scattered radiation at high $q$, i.e. at high scattering angles $2\\Theta$, have a strong influence on the resolution. The signal-to-noise ratio at high $q$ defines the \"effective\" maximum solid angle in a specific experiment setup up to which a detector can efficiently detect a signal and in consequence determines the achievable resolution. The image contrast defines how well bright image features can be distinguished from dark ones.
