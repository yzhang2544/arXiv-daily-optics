    "abstract": "           Stimulated by the renewed interest and recent developments in semi-empirical quantum chemical (SQC) methods for noncovalent interactions, we examine the properties of liquid water at ambient conditions by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, both with the conventional NDDO-type (neglect of diatomic differential overlap) methods, e.g. AM1 and PM6, and with DFTB-type (density-functional tight-binding) methods, e.g. DFTB2 and GFN-xTB. Besides the original parameter sets, some specifically reparametrized SQC methods (denoted as AM1-W, PM6-fm, and DFTB2-iBi) targeting various smaller water systems ranging from molecular clusters to bulk are considered as well. The quality of these different SQC methods for describing liquid water properties at ambient conditions are assessed by comparison to well-established experimental data and also to BLYP-D3 density functional theory-based ab initio MD simulations. Our analyses reveal that static and dynamics properties of bulk water are poorly described by all considered SQC methods with the original parameters, regardless of the underlying theoretical models, with most of the methods suffering from too weak hydrogen bonds and hence predicting a far too fluid water with highly distorted hydrogen bond kinetics. On the other hand, the reparametrized force-matchcd PM6-fm method is shown to be able to quantitatively reproduce the static and dynamic features of liquid water, and thus can be used as a computationally efficient alternative to electronic structure-based MD simulations for liquid water that requires extended length and time scales. DFTB2-iBi predicts a slightly overstructured water with reduced fluidity, whereas AM1-W gives an amorphous ice-like structure for water at ambient conditions.         ",

To experimentally explore high-dimensional physics, it is advantageous to augment the physical space with synthetic dimensions. An emerging approach is to use a single modulated photonic ring resonator to form multiple synthetic frequency dimensions. However, all the high-dimensional Hamiltonians experimentally demonstrated in this approach are topologically trivial. Here we propose a general scheme to create high-dimensional topological physics using multiple synthetic frequency dimensions in a single ring resonator. This scheme utilizes specifically designed mode-selective modulations and mode conversions to create non-trivial topology. As examples, we numerically demonstrate a three-dimensional, two-band model exhibiting Weyl points and topological insulator phases, and a five-dimensional, four-band model exhibiting Yang monopoles and Weyl surfaces. Our results will facilitate the experimental studies and future applications of topological physics in high dimensions.         ",

By modulating the laser at its repetition rate and twice this frequency, we create a 1D triangular ladder with a staggered phase flux, which breaks time-reversal symmetry. This enables continuous tuning of a strong central lobe across the full bandwidth of our Quantum Cascade Laser frequency comb at 1340cm$^{-1}$.

Although magnetics and optics readily lend themselves to two-dimensional realizations of spin texture, only recently have breakthroughs brought forth three-dimensional (3D) magnetic skyrmions, whereas their optical counterparts have eluded observation to date because their realization requires precise control over the spatiotemporal spectrum. Here, we demonstrate the first 3D-localized optical skyrmionic structures with a non-trivial topological spin profile by imprinting meron spin texture on open and closed spectral surfaces in the momentum-energy space of an ultrafast optical wave packet. Precise control over the spatiotemporal spin texture of light - a key requisite for synthesizing 3D optical merons - is the product of synergy between novel methodologies in the modulation of light jointly in space and time, digital holography, and large-area birefringent metasurfaces.

To address the challenge of weak spontaneous emission, different optical cavities are fabricated to enhance the emission rate. However, the relative location between cavity and emitter is random, which greatly reduce the success probability of enhancement. Here, we report on a fluorescence-localization technique (FLT) for precisely locating single G center in silicon and embedding it in the center of a circular Bragg grating cavity in situ, achieving 240-times improvement of the success probability. We observe a 30-fold enhancement in luminescence intensity, 2.5-fold acceleration of the emission from single G center, corresponding to a Purcell factor exceeding 11.

    "abstract": "           Quantum computing is viewed as a promising technology because of its potential for polynomial growth in complexity, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in its classical counterparts. In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid variational algorithm, is utilized to simulate molecules using qubits and calculate molecular properties. However, simulating a chemical reaction to compute the reaction energy using VQE algorithm has not yet reached chemical accuracy relative to the benchmark computational chemistry methods due to limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise introduced within the model. To address this issue, we propose the definition of different active spaces for studying chemical reactions, incorporating irreducible representations of both the ground and excited states of the molecules. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves chemical accuracy in predicting the reaction energy for various reactions. For all reactions studied, the difference in reaction energies between conventional computational chemistry methods and the quantum-classical hybrid VQE algorithm is less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, our analysis simplifies the process of selecting active spaces and electrons for each reaction, reducing it to a single optimal combination that ensures the chemical accuracy for each reaction.

This study explores the hypothesis that TML beams can be regarded as high-speed equivalents of such periodically deflected beams. By analytically modeling the spatiotemporal properties of TML beams as well as experimentally examining periodically deflected beams, both their intensity and phase dynamics were assessed. It is shown that TML beams yield a scanning motion which is shape-invariant upon propagation and have characteristic spatiotemporal phase dynamics. While TML-like scanning in intensity can be recreated by combining periodic translational and rotational deflection, beams deflected by mirrors still exhibit different phase dynamics. These findings imply that TML beams cannot simply be categorized as high-speed variants of periodically deflected beams. Nonetheless, TML beams remain applicable to high-speed laser beam scanning, although their phase dynamics have to be considered in phase-sensitive processes.         ",

Using Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA), we optimize the grating's geometry to maximize key figures of merit. The grating consists of a 2D square lattice of nanoholes and is designed to diffract normally incident 780 nm circularly polarized light into the four first orders, each with a diffraction efficiency of 0.24, of which 99.7% has the correct circular handedness. Our 2D diffraction grating can enhance the performance of GMOTs employing 2D gratings by improving the axial radiation pressure balance and providing a high degree of circular polarization. Furthermore, we investigated the robustness of our 2D grating to ensure high manufacturing resilience.         ",

However, the on-demand manipulation of the superbunching effect in colloidal quantum dots (QDs) under pulsed excitation, which is beneficial to integrated photonics and lab-on-a-chip quantum devices, is still challenging. Here, we disclosed the evolution of $g^{(2)}(0)$ with the parameters of colloidal QDs by Mento Carlo simulations and performed second-order correlation measurements on CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs under both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed lasers. The photon statistics of a single colloidal QD have been substantially tailored from sub-Poissonian distribution $g^{(2)}(0) <1$) to superbunching emission, with the maximum $g^{(2)}(0)$ reaching 69 and 20 under CW and pulsed excitation, respectively. We have achieved correlated biphoton imaging (CPI), employing the coincidence of the biexciton and bright exciton in one laser pulse, with the stray light and background noise up to 53 times stronger than PL emission of single colloidal QDs. By modulating the PL intensity, the Fourier-domain CPI with reasonably good contrast has been determined, with the stray light noise up to 107 times stronger than PL emission and 75600 times stronger than the counts of biphotons. Our noise-resistance CPI may enable laboratory-based quantum imaging to be applied to real-world applications with the highly desired suppression of strong background noise and stray light.

    "abstract": "           Silicon photodetectors are highly desirable for their CMOS compatibility, low cost, and fast response speed. However, their application the infrared (IR) is limited by silicon's intrinsic bandgap, which restricts its detection to photons with wavelengths shorter than 1100 nm. Although several methods have been developed to extend silicon photodetectors further in the IR range, these approaches often introduce additional challenges, such as increased fabrication complexity and compatibility issues with standard CMOS processes. Here, we present an approach to overcome these limitations by integrating disordered metasurfaces with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), enabling IR detection by silicon photodetectors. The disordered design consists of hybrid Mie-plasmonic cavities, which can enhance both the near-field localization and wide-band light absorption from visible to IR, improving photocurrent conversion. Compared to ordered structures, the infrared absorption and near field of the highly disordered configuration are increased by 2.6-folds and 3.9-folds, respectively. UCNPs not only convert near-infrared photons into visible light but also enhance absorption in the mid-infrared range, thereby improving hot electron generation. The measured responsivity of the disordered element for 1550 nm laser is up to 0.22 A/W at room temperature, corresponding to an external quantum efficiency of 17.6%. Our design not only enhances the photocurrent performance significantly, but also extends the working wavelength of silicon photodetectors to IR wavelength, making them suitable for broad spectrum applications.

The reactive molecule is modeled using a triple-well potential, allowing two competing reaction pathways that yield distinct products. Dynamical and equilibrium simulations are performed using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion approach in real- and imaginary-time formulations, respectively, both implemented with tree tensor network decomposition schemes. We consider two illustrative cases: one dominated by slow kinetics and another by ultrafast processes. Our results demonstrate that in both scenarios, the rates of ground-state reaction pathways can be selectively enhanced when the cavity frequency is tuned in resonance with the relevant vibrational transition, which directly leads to the formation of the corresponding product. In addition, due to the anharmonicity of chemical reactions, cavity-induced vibrational transitions within the reactant region can also influence reaction rates even when they do not directly result in product formation. However, we found that the equilibrium populations remain unchanged when the molecule is moved into the cavity, regardless of the cavity frequency. Thus, our proof-of-concept study highlights that cavity-induced modifications of chemical reactivities in resonant conditions arise from dynamical and non-equilibrium interactions between the cavity mode and molecular vibrations, rather than from the significant changes in equilibrium properties.

In contrast, SWCNTs with quantum defects that localize excitons show no power-dependent diffusion. Chemical manipulation of exciton concentration by molecules that increase or decrease SWCNT fluorescence also modulate the diffusion constant by a factor of up to 2. Additionally, excitons increase the macroscopic viscosity of SWCNT solutions. Optical pump Terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy reveals transient absorption features of water (37 /cm and above 80 /cm), indicating energy dissipation into translational modes of its hydrogen bond network. Molecular dynamics simulations further support a mechanism in which exciton-induced dipoles enhance frictional forces.

Soliton fission and Raman scattering comprise two such phenomena that are ideal testbeds for exploring multimode nonlinear optics, especially power-dependent physics. To fully capture the complexity of such processes, an experimental measurement technique capable of measuring shot-to-shot pulse variations is necessary. The dispersive Fourier transform (DFT) is the ideal technique to achieve this goal, using chromatic dispersion to temporally stretch an ultrafast pulse and map its spectrum onto a measurable temporal waveform. Here, we apply DFT to explore the power-dependent mean field and noise properties of soliton fission and Raman scattering. To explain quantum noise properties, the traditional approach is to perform several hundred stochastic simulations for computing statistics. In our work, we apply quantum sensitivity analysis (QSA) to compute the noise in any output observable based on fluctuations in the input pulse, all using a single backwards differentiation step. We find that the combination of DFT and QSA provides a powerful framework for understanding the quantum and classical properties of soliton fission and Raman scattering, and can be generalized to other multimode nonlinear phenomena.

In our pursuit of implementing saliency modulation for optical see-through near-eye displays, we decided to introduce a blur effect to reduce the sharpness of specific areas while preserving the sharpness of others. In this study, we used a digital micromirror device (DMD) to separate the incoming light from a scene into sharp and blurred areas. To achieve this, we integrated an electrically tunable lens (ETL), which operates in its zero optical power mode when the reflected light from the DMD represents the sharp area (i.e., the blur area is masked). Conversely, when the reflected light indicates the blur area, the ETL adjusts to non-zero optical powers. Importantly, these modulations occur at a speed that surpasses the critical flicker frequency threshold of the human eye. Furthermore, we proposed an algorithm to mitigate the artifacts around the border area between the sharp and blur areas that are caused by the magnification of the ETL. We have also developed a prototype system to demonstrate the feasibility of our method.         ",

    "abstract": "           Second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG) is a powerful imaging modality which has found applications in investigating both biological and synthetic nanostructures. Like all optical microscopy techniques, the resolution of SHG is limited to approximately half the wavelength of the excitation light. Because of this several groups have proposed techniques to enable super-resolution SHG imaging. However, these techniques often involve quite complicated optical setups compared to standard SHG microscopes, a major impediment towards more widespread utilization. Here we apply super-resolution radial fluctuations (SRRF), a commonly used technique for super-resolution fluorescence imaging, to enable super-resolution SHG microscopy. By imaging individual nanostructures, we demonstrate that SRRF can provide resolution enhancement of up to 3x compared to a laser scanning SHG microscope, which is comparable to the best resolution enhancement reported in the literature. Additionally, we show that SRRF maintains the polarization dependence of SHG, therefore enabling super-resolution polarization SHG imaging. Finally, we perform SRRF processing on third harmonic generation images to demonstrate the significant potential of SRRF for other super-resolution nonlinear optical microscopy. Importantly, since SRRF can achieve super-resolution purely through image processing, the technique demonstrated here could be used to enhance the resolution of images obtained using a wide variety of nonlinear optical microscopy setups including both laser scanning and widefield configurations.

The 4-qubit self-complementary NSA code outperforms its non-NSA counterpart in fidelity and Knill-Laflamme condition violation. The pair-complementary code, which has no known non-NSA analog, achieves even better performance with higher-order loss suppression and better fidelity. We further generalize both approaches to families of NSA AD codes of arbitrary system size, as well as an NSA variant of the 0-2-4 binomial code for single-photon loss. Our results demonstrate that adaptation to noise strength can lead to significant improvements in error correction capability, and highlight how machine learning can help discover new valuable codes that may be missed through conventional algebraic approaches.

Through ab-initio calculations of HCl molecules and a corresponding model system coupled to a cavity, we demonstrate that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule case and follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary resonant polariton splitting.

In this work, we report the results of the radiative recombination dynamics in b-Si produced by a technique involving thermal oxidation, photoresist coating and chlorine plasma etching.

This component involves two decay processes with a peak energy at around 480 nm, which have the fast component of about 15 ps followed by a component of around 50 ps lifetime. The emission exhibits a slow process in red spectral region with time constant of 1500 ps. When the surface is smoothed, the lifetime of carriers increased up to 4500 ps and the emission peak blue shifted indicating downsizing in dimensions.

    "abstract": "           Strong optical nonlinearities are key to a range of technologies, particularly in the generation of photonic quantum states. The strongest nonlinearity in hot atomic vapors originates from electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), which, while effective, often lacks tunability and suffers from significant losses due to atomic absorption. We propose and demonstrate an N-level EIT scheme, created by an optical frequency comb that excites a warm rubidium vapor. The massive number of comb lines simultaneously drive numerous transitions that interfere constructively to induce a giant and highly tunable cross-Kerr optical nonlinearity. The obtained third-order nonlinearity values range from $1.2 \\times 10^{-7}$ to $7.7 \\times 10^{-7}$ $m^2 V^{-2}$. Above and beyond that, the collective N-level interference can be optimized by phase shaping the comb lines using a spectral phase mask. Each nonlinearity value can then be tuned over a wide range, from 40\\% to 250\\% of the initial strength. We utilize the nonlinearity to demonstrate squeezing by self polarization rotation of CW signals that co-propagate with the pump and are tuned to one of the EIT transparent regions. Homodyne measurements reveal a quadrature squeezing level of 3.5 dB at a detuning of 640 MHz. When tuned closer to an atomic resonance, the nonlinearity is significantly enhanced while maintaining low losses, resulting in the generation of non-Gaussian cubic phase states. These states exhibit negative regions in their Wigner functions, a hallmark of quantum behavior. Consequently, N-level EIT enables the direct generation of photonic quantum states without requiring postselection.         ",

However, the mechanisms underlying IVD events remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the physical processes responsible for long-duration IVD events by analyzing the SEP event observed by SolO on 2022 June 7. We explore the role of evolving shock connectivity, particle acceleration at interplanetary (IP) shocks, and cross-field transport in shaping the observed particle this http URL utilize data from Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) suite onboard SolO to analyze the characteristics of the IVD, and model the event using the Heliospheric Energetic Particle Acceleration and Transport (HEPAT) model. The IVD event exhibited a distinct and long-duration IVD signature, across proton energies from 1 to 20 MeV and lasting for approximately 10 hours. Simulations suggest that evolving shock connectivity and the evolution of shock play a primary role in the IVD signature, with SolO transitioning from shock flank to nose over time, resulting in a gradual increase in maximum particle energy along the field line. Furthermore, model results show that limited cross-field diffusion can influence both the nose energy and the duration of the IVD event. This study demonstrates that long-duration IVD events are primarily driven by evolving magnetic connectivity along a non-uniform shock that evolves over time, where the connection moves to more efficient acceleration sites as the shock propagates farther from the Sun. Other mechanisms, such as acceleration time at the shock, may also contribute to the observed IVD features.         ",

    "abstract": "           Topology has emerged as a fundamental property of many systems, manifesting in cosmology, condensed matter, high-energy physics and waves. Despite the rich textures, the topology has largely been limited to low dimensional systems that can be characterised by a single topological number, e.g., a Chern number in matter or a Skyrme number in waves. Here, using photonic quantum states as an example, we harness the synthetic dimensions of orbital angular momentum (OAM) to discover a rich tapestry of topological maps in high dimensional spaces. Moving beyond spin textured fields, we demonstrate topologies using only one degree of freedom, the OAM of light. By interpreting the density matrix as a non-Abelian Higgs potential, we are able to predict topologies that exist as high dimensional manifolds which remarkably can be deconstructed into a multitude of simpler maps from disks to disks and spheres to spheres, giving rise to the notion of a topological spectrum rather than a topological number. We confirm this experimentally using quantum wave functions with an underlying topology of 48 dimensions and a topological spectrum spanning over 17000 maps, an encoding alphabet with enormous potential. We show that the topological spectrum allows the simultaneous ability to be robust to and probe for perturbation, the latter made possible by observing emergent signatures in the non-topological (trivial) spaces of the spectrum. Our experimental approach benefits from easy implementation, while our theoretical framework is cast in a manner that can be extrapolated to any particle type, dimension and degree of freedom.

We use a tailored update, specifically designed to target the low energy excitations of the QSL. This allows us to reliably simulate Rydberg atoms on a triangular lattice in the proposed QSL regime. We identify a correlated paramagnetic phase at low temperatures which hosts topological protection similar to a $Z_2$ spin liquid up to a length scale tuned by Hamiltonian parameters.

At the nanoscale, high nuclear spin polarization through spin fluctuations (statistical polarization) far outweighs thermal polarization. However, until now efficient NMR detection using coherent averaging techniques could not be applied to the detection of statistical polarization, leading to long measurement times. Here we present two protocols to enable coherent averaging of statistical oscillating signals through rectification.

    "abstract": "           Probabilistic computing with pbits is emerging as a computational paradigm for machine learning and for facing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with the so-called probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs). From a hardware point of view, the key elements that characterize a PIM are the random number generation, the nonlinearity, the network of coupled pbits, and the energy minimization algorithm. Regarding the latter, in this work we show that PIMs using the simulated quantum annealing (SQA) schedule exhibit better performance as compared to simulated annealing and parallel tempering in solving a number of COPs, such as maximum satisfiability problems, planted Ising problem, and travelling salesman problem. Additionally, we design and simulate the architecture of a fully connected CMOS based PIM able to run the SQA algorithm having a spin-update time of 8 ns with a power consumption of 0.22 mW. Our results also show that SQA increases the reliability and the scalability of PIMs by compensating for device variability at an algorithmic level enabling the development of their implementation combining CMOS with different technologies such as spintronics. This work shows that the characteristics of the SQA are hardware agnostic and can be applied in the co-design of any hybrid analog digital Ising machine implementation. Our results open a promising direction for the implementation of a new generation of reliable and scalable PIMs.         ",

This higher-dimensional space of parameters for which the HOM effect occurs constitutes what is known as a Hong-Ou-Mandel manifold (HOMM). Using a parallel series of non-identical MRRs and changing relative round-trip phase shifts between MRRs allows for the manipulation of the wavelength locations of the HOM effect. Through clever design and fabrication, we can mold the HOMM to place multiple HOM effects, or lack thereof, precisely at desired locations in wavelength. In this paper we discuss how to adjust non-identical MRR parameters to change the resulting HOMM. We also promote example designs that exhibit advantageous HOMM structures, and highlight some of the diverse possibilities that can be accessed with different circuit design. Our main examples are: 1) a wavelength division multiplexer example that matches the HOM effect locations with the already established channels to integrate with a classical communication network and 2) a HOM-based entanglement switch that allows for the rapid switching between 2-photon NOON state outputs and completely separable single photon outputs.

We report a semiconductor laser with a sub-100 Hz intrinsic linewidth, achieved via EOF. The laser features a U-shaped cavity with two sampled grating distributed Bragg reflectors (SG-DBRs), enabling broad tunability across a 42 nm wavelength range (1513-1555 nm). By injecting optical feedback into both sides of the laser cavity via an external fiber-based cavity, we reduce the intrinsic linewidth by more than three orders of magnitude, from MHz to sub-kHz across the laser's tuning range. By dynamically tuning the polarization, we demonstrate sub-100 Hz intrinsic linewidths at feedback powers up to 10 %, marking an improvement over prior studies where CC limited performance.

However, existing methodologies to inverse design electromagnetic devices require computationally expensive and time-consuming full-wave electromagnetic simulation at each inverse design iteration or generation of large datasets for training neural-network surrogate models. This work introduces the Precomputed Numerical Green Function method, an approach for ultrafast electromagnetic inverse design. The static components of the design are incorporated into a numerical Green function obtained from a single fully parallelized precomputation step, reducing the cost of evaluating candidate designs during optimization to only being proportional to the size of the region under modification. A low-rank matrix update technique is introduced that further decreases the cost of the method to milliseconds per iteration without any approximations or compromises in accuracy. The complete method is shown to have linear time complexity, reducing the total runtime for an inverse design by several orders of magnitude compared to using conventional electromagnetics solvers. The design examples considered demonstrate speedups of up to 16,000x, lowering the design process from multiple days to weeks down to minutes. The approach stands to transform inverse design in electromagnetics.         ",

Start-to-end simulations revealed that this systematic optimization significantly reduces the system's sensitivity to parametric variations.

Previous studies on single impurities relied on incoherent optical excitation to generate photons. However, many quantum applications require resonant driving of quantum emitters to precisely control optical transitions and maintain coherence of the emission. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical emission of quantum light from a resonantly driven single impurity-bound exciton in ZnSe. The resonantly driven emitter exhibits bright quantum light emission that preserves the phase of the resonant drive, validated through polarization interferometry. Resonant excitation enables us to directly measure the Debye-Waller factor, determined to be 0.94, which indicates high efficiency emission to the zero-phonon line. Time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements reveal a fast optically-driven ionization process that we attribute to Auger recombination, along with a slower spontaneous ionization process having a lifetime of 21 {\\mu}s due to charge tunneling from the impurity. We show that incoherent, low-power laser pumping efficiently stabilizes the charge of the impurity-bound exciton on the timescale of 9.3 ns, recovering the resonance fluorescence emission from the bound exciton. These results pave the way for coherent optical and spin control of the single impurity states through resonant excitation of impurity-bound excitons in II-VI semiconductors.         ",
