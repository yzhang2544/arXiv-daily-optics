    "abstract": "           Ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death driven by oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a pivotal research focus with implications across various cellular contexts. In this study, we employed a multifaceted approach, integrating label-free Raman spectroscopy and microfluidics to study the mechanisms underpinning ferroptosis. Our investigations included the ferroptosis initiation based on the changes in the lipid Raman band at 1436 cm-1 under different cellular states, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, DNA damage/repair, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, our work highlighted the dynamic role of vital cellular components, such as NADPH, ferredoxin clusters, and key genes like GPX-4, VDAC2, and NRF2, as they collectively influenced cellular responses to redox imbalance and oxidative stress. Quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular docking simulations (MD) provided further evidence of interactions between the ferredoxin (containing 4Fe-4S clusters), NADPH and ROS which led to the production of reactive Fe species in the cells. As such, our approach offered a real-time, multidimensional perspective on ferroptosis, surpassing traditional biological methods, and providing valuable insights for therapeutic interventions in diverse biomedical contexts.

This study presents a robust method for improving pulse energy stability by incorporating a dispersion element that introduces longitudinal dispersion into the electron beam during the exponential growth phase of the SASE process. At this phase, the density modulation of the electron beam, characterized by the bunching factor, undergoes large fluctuations, resulting in substantial variations in the emitted radiation power. The introduction of longitudinal dispersion allows for controlled manipulation of the bunching distribution, suppressing fluctuations and enhancing pulse energy stability. The stabilization mechanism is explained in this paper, and its impact on the radiation properties is analyzed for both the standard SASE scheme and advanced lasing setups, such as a two-stage lasing process for two-color pulse generation, with the initial stage operating in SASE mode.

However, residual excitation light can still interfere with their relatively low brightness. While commonly used lock-in detection can distinguish weak signals from substantial random background, concurrently modulated residual excitation light is not eliminated. This remains a challenge, particularly under demanding experimental conditions. Here, we explore the inherent nonlinear response of UCNPs and discover that UCNPs can act as frequency mixers in response to intensity-modulated excitation. Particularly, modulated excitation with more than one base modulation frequency can generate additional low-frequency beating-signals. We show how these signals are resolvable by low-speed detectors such as cameras, are devoid of ambient and residual excitation light, and how they can be enhanced through nanoparticle engineering. Detection of beating-signals thus provides a strategy to significantly enhance signal-to-background conditions in UCNP-based bioimaging and biosensing.         ",

Achieving these goals requires high-precision measurements of particles. Taichu seires, Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS), a key component of the vertex detector for CEPC was designed to meet the CEPC's requirements. For the geometry of vertex detector is long barrel with no endcap, and current silicon lacks a complete digitization model, precise estimation of cluster size particularly causing by particle with large incident angle is needed. Testbeam results were conducted at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) to evaluate cluster size dependence on different incident angles and threshold settings. Experimental results confirmed that cluster size increases with incident angle. Simulations using the Allpix$^2$ framework replicated experimental trends at small angles but exhibited discrepancies at large angles, suggesting limitations in linear electric field assumptions and sensor thickness approximations. The results from both testbeam and simulations have provided insights into the performance of the TaichuPix chip at large incident angles, offering a crucial foundation for the establishment of a digital model and addressing the estimation of cluster size in the forward region of the long barrel. Furthermore, it offers valuable references for future iterations of TaichuPix, the development of digital models, and the simulation and estimation of the vertex detector's performance.         ",

    "abstract": "           This paper presents a frequency synthesis that achieves exceptional stability by transferring optical signals to the radio frequency (RF) domain at 100 MHz. We describe and characterize two synthesis chains composed of a cryogenic silicon cavity-stabilized laser at 1542 nm and an ultra-low expansion (ULE) glass cavity at 1157 nm, both converted to 10 GHz signals via Ti:Sapphire and Er/Yb:glass optical frequency combs (OFCs). The 10 GHz microwave outputs are further divided down to 100 MHz using a commercial microwave prescaler, which exhibits a residual frequency instability of $\\sigma_y(1~\\text{s})<10^{-15}$ and low $10^{-18}$ level at a few thousand seconds. Measurements are performed using a newly developed custom ultra-low-noise digital measurement system and are compared to the carrier-suppression technique. The new system enables high-sensitivity evaluation across the entire synthesis chain, from the optical and microwave heterodynes as well as the direct RF signals. Results show an absolute instability of $\\sigma_y(1~\\text{s})~\\approx~4.7\\times10^{-16}$ at 100 MHz. This represents the first demonstration of such low instability at 100 MHz, corresponding to a phase noise of -140 dBc/Hz at a 1 Hz offset and significantly surpassing earlier systems. These advancements open new opportunities for precision metrology and timing systems.         ",

The achievable on/off switching ratio is shown to be constrained by the material's loss parameter, particularly in the ENZ regime, where transmissivity increases with higher material loss. The finite loss in real materials limit the more extraordinary potential of ideal near-zero-index systems. Along with an in-depth discussion on the material parameters vis-a-vis the underlying physics, this work provides avenues to overcome the shortcomings of finite loss in real materials.

However, in practice it often happens that a small subset of parameters suffice to describe the dynamics of the system itself in terms of stiff combinations, while the remaining sloppy combinations provide no information on the system. While this effect can reduce model complexity, it can also limit the estimation precision when the stiff and sloppy combinations are unknown to the experimenter, and one is forced to estimate the potentially sloppy model parameters. We explored how such a sloppy behavior can be controlled and counteracted via quantum weak measurements in the estimation of two sequential phases. We showed that the introduction of a weak measurement of variable strength in-between the two phases allows to switch from a fully sloppy setup to a fully determined one where both phases can be estimated with quantum-limited precision. Our work provides an important insight of sloppiness detection in quantum systems, with promising applications in quantum metrology and imaging, as well as to quantum security and quantum monitoring.

    "abstract": "           Quantum computing leverages qubits, exploiting superposition and entanglement to solve problems intractable for classical computers, offering significant computational advantages. Quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning, holds immense potential across various fields but remains largely unexplored in geosciences. However, its progress is hindered by the limitations of current NISQ hardware. To address these challenges, hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) have emerged, combining quantum layers within classical neural networks to leverage the strengths of both paradigms. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first application of QML to subsurface imaging through the development of hybrid quantum physics-informed neural networks (HQ-PINNs) for seismic inversion. We apply the HQ-PINN framework to invert pre-stack and post-stack seismic datasets, estimating P- and S-impedances. The proposed HQ-PINN architecture follows an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder (HQNN), processes seismic data to estimate elastic parameters, while the decoder utilizes these parameters to generate the corresponding seismic data based on geophysical relationships. The HQ-PINN model is trained by minimizing the misfit between the input and predicted seismic data generated by the decoder. We systematically evaluate various quantum layer configurations, differentiation methods, and quantum device simulators on the inversion performance, and demonstrate real-world applicability through the individual and simultaneous inversion cases of the Sleipner dataset. The HQ-PINN framework consistently and efficiently estimated accurate subsurface impedances across the synthetic and field case studies, establishing the feasibility of leveraging QML for seismic inversion, thereby paving the way for broader applications of quantum computing in geosciences.

    "abstract": "           Atom-cavity systems offer unique advantages for building large-scale distributed quantum computers by providing strong atom-photon coupling while allowing for high-fidelity local operations of atomic qubits. However, in prevalent schemes where the photonic state is encoded in polarization, cavity birefringence introduces an energy splitting of the cavity eigenmodes and alters the polarization states, thus limiting the fidelity of remote entanglement generation. To address this challenge, we propose a scheme that encodes the photonic qubit in the frequency degree-of-freedom. The scheme relies on resonant coupling of multiple transverse cavity modes to different atomic transitions that are well-separated in frequency. We numerically investigate the temporal properties of the photonic wavepacket, two-photon interference visibility, and atom-atom entanglement fidelity under various cavity polarization-mode splittings and find that our scheme is less affected by cavity birefringence. Finally, we propose practical implementations in two trapped ion systems, using the fine structure splitting in the metastable D state of $\\mathrm{^{40}Ca^{+}}$, and the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of $\\mathrm{^{225}Ra^{+}}$. Our study presents an alternative approach for cavity-based quantum networks that is less sensitive to birefringent effects, and is applicable to a variety of atomic and solid-state emitter-cavity interfaces.

However, when certain degrees of freedom are coupled to an environment, the relevant dynamics can be captured by non-unitary evolution operators, arising from non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a photonic platform that implements non-unitary quantum walks, commonly used to emulate open-system dynamics, in the synthetic space of light transverse momentum. These walks are realized by propagating light through a series of dichroic liquid-crystal metasurfaces, that impart polarization-dependent momentum shifts. The non-unitary behavior stems from dichroic dye molecules with polarization-dependent absorption, whose orientation is coupled to that of the liquid crystals. We demonstrate multiple walks up to five time steps, with adjustable levels of dichroism set by the metasurface voltage, which is controlled remotely. This discrete-time process maps onto two-band tight-binding models with reciprocal yet non-Hermitian nearest-neighbor couplings, corresponding to a less-studied class of non-Hermitian systems. Our platform broadens the range of optical simulators for controlled investigations of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Despite the successful demonstration of compact free electron lasers (FELs) driven by laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs), the shot-to-shot fluctuations inherent to LWFAs remain a major obstacle to realizing LWFA-driven FELs with high gain and robust operation. Here, we present a conceptual design for LWFA-driven FELs with enhanced robustness and reliability. By employing Bayesian optimization techniques, the beamline was optimized to achieve sufficient tolerance against these fluctuations under actual experimental conditions. Start-to-end simulations revealed that this systematic optimization significantly reduces the system's sensitivity to parametric variations. With the optimized configurations, the radiation energy can be maintained above 1 microjoule at a wavelength of approximately 25 nm, even when accounting for twice the root-mean-square (RMS) ranges of these inherent jitters. This proposed scheme represents a substantial advancement in the development of compact LWFA-driven FEL systems, enabling robust operation and paving the way for the realization of reliable and widely accessible sources.

    "title": "Nuclear-electronic calculations need uncontracted basis sets on the quantum protons",
    "abstract": "           An attractive way to calculate nuclear quantum effects is to describe select nuclei quantum mechanically at the same level as the electrons, requiring the solution of coupled Schr\u00f6dinger equations for the electrons and the quantum nuclei. This is commonly known as the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) method, but it also has many other names. Two types of basis sets are required: a nuclear basis set is required in addition to the usual electronic basis set. In this work, we demonstrate that while existing nuclear basis sets are sufficient for NEO density-functional calculations, many sets producing proton affinities converged within 0.1 kcal/mol of the complete basis set limit, NEO calculations should always use uncontracted electronic basis sets on the quantum protons, since the contraction coefficients in typical electronic basis sets have been derived for point nuclear charge distributions. Uncontracting the basis sets on the quantized protons leads to significantly faster convergence to the basis set limit, leading to improvements of 18 kcal/mol and 10 kcal/mol in proton affinities employing double-$\\zeta$ aug-pc-1 and triple-$\\zeta$ aug-pc-2 electronic basis sets, respectively, with little effect on the computational effort. The partially uncontracted aug-pc-3 electronic basis set already affords proton affinities converged beyond 0.1 kcal/mol from the complete basis set limit. Similar results are also obtained with Dunning's correlation-consistent cc-pVXZ basis sets, as well as the Karlsruhe def2-XZP basis sets, albeit at a somewhat slower rate of convergence. As the protonic basis sets yield fully converged values, we find the protonic basis sets to be unnecessarily large for ground state density functional calculations, as the error in the protonic basis set is not balanced with that for typical electronic basis sets.

    "abstract": "           We show that the Gross-Pitaevskii equation coupled with the wave equation for a wire (GP-W) provides a natural theoretical framework for understanding recent experiments employing a nanowire to detect a single quantum vortex in superfluid $^4 {\\rm He}$. We uncover the complete spatiotemporal evolution of such wire-based vortex detection via direct numerical simulations of the GP-W system. Furthermore, by computing the spatiotemporal spectrum, we obtain the vortex-capture-induced change in the oscillation frequency of the wire. We quantify this frequency shift by plotting the wire's oscillation frequency versus time and obtain results that closely match experimental observations. In addition, we provide analytical support for our numerical results by deriving the dispersion relation for the oscillating wire, with and without a trapped vortex. We show that the Magnus force opens a gap in the wire dispersion relation. The size of the gap becomes the characteristic frequency of the wire when a vortex is trapped.         ",

    "abstract": "           A recent article by Ivander, Lindoy and Lee [Nature Communications 15, 8087 (2024)] claims to discover the relationship between the generalized quantum master equation (GQME) and the path integral for a system coupled to a harmonic bath. However, this relationship was already established in 2020 by Makri in the context of the small matrix decomposition of the path integral (SMatPI) [J. Chem. Theory and Comput. 16, 4038 (2020)]. The procedure that this article uses in its Supplementary Information (SI) to obtain the various matrices follows the SMatPI decomposition steps for the alternative Trotter ordering. The absence of endpoint effects in the kernel matrices of the discretized GQME expression for the reduced density matrix (RDM) is the consequence of a crude GQME discretization and is not consistent with the SMatPI decomposition of an auxiliary matrix presented in the SI. This form is identical to the transfer tensor method (TTM) of Cerrillo and Cao [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 110401 (2014)]. Further, the Dyck path section of this article follows precisely the diagrammatic analysis developed by Wang and Cai in a recent paper [Communications in Computational Physics 36, 389 (2024)]. We elaborate on these three critiques in this Comment.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum criticality of open many-body systems has attracted lots of interest for emergent phenomena and universality. Here we present the exact steady state of the quantum van der Pol oscillator using the complex $P$-representation. We show the threshold corresponds to a dissipative phase transition with abrupt changes of steady-state properties and enhanced metrology. The critical behaviors and finite-size effects are investigated through the analytical steady state. Moreover, we obtain divergent quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the thermodynamic limit both at the critical point and in the time crystal phase, but only the QFI at the critical point approaches the Heisenberg limit. We further prove that the steady-state photon number is the optimized estimated observable with the largest signal-to-noise ratio. We show that the Heisenberg-limited metrology originates from the larger enhancement of the susceptibility than the standard deviation of the photon number. Our work reveals the underlying relation between the time crystal, dissipative phase transition, and enhanced metrology.         ",

    "abstract": "           We investigate the dynamic transition of quantum turbulence (QT) in a confined potential field as the system evolves from purely two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-two-dimensional, and ultimately to three-dimensional (3D), by fixing the lateral dimensions of the trapping box while varying its height. In the 2DQT, distinct Onsager vortex cluster formation and inverse energy cascade are observed, while 3DQT exhibits a direct energy cascade consistent with the Vinen turbulence decay rate, which display striking differences. By systematically altering the system height, we explore how dimensionality drives the differentiation of turbulence types and find that this transition is closely related to the excitation of Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves not only introduce additional dissipation mechanisms but also serve as mediators for direct energy transfer across scales. When the wavelength of the permitted Kelvin waves exceeds the critical size of vortex clusters, turbulence begins transitioning to 3D type, culminating in fully developed 3DQT at the characteristic scale. In the transitional region, we observe continuous variations in the decay rate and vortex cluster correlation functions.         ",
