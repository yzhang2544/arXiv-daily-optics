However, the identification of molecules with strong terahertz-to-visible upconversion efficiency is limited by the availability of suitable compounds in commercial databases. Here, we employ the generative autoregressive deep neural network, G-SchNet, to perform property-driven design of novel monothiolated molecules tailored for terahertz radiation detection. To design functional organic molecules, we iteratively bias G-SchNet to drive molecular generation towards highly active and synthesizable molecules based on machine learning-based property predictors, including molecular fingerprints and state-of-the-art neural networks. We study the reliability of these property predictors for generated molecules and analyze the chemical space and properties of generated molecules to identify trends in activity. Finally, we filter generated molecules and plan retrosynthetic routes from commercially available reactants to identify promising novel compounds and their most active vibrational modes in terahertz-to-visible upconversion.

To address this, we measured the quantum efficiency (QE) of various electrode materials for vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons in LXe, including platinum (Pt), stainless steel (SUS304), and magnesium fluoride (MgF$_{2}$)-coated aluminum (Al). Our results show that MgF$_{2}$-coated Al exhibits the lowest QE among the tested materials. The QE for VUV photons with a mean wavelength of 179.5~nm was measured to be $(7.2 \\pm 2.3) \\times 10^{-5}$, corresponding to a reduction by a factor of 4.4 compared to SUS304, a commonly used electrode material in direct dark matter experiments with LXe.

    "abstract": "           Sublinear resonant deviations from an exceptional point degeneracy (EPD) has been recently promoted as a sensing scheme. However, there is still an ongoing debate whether the sensitivity advantage is negated by an increase in fundamental noise - especially when active elements induce self-oscillations. In this case, nonlinearities are crucial in stabilizing amplifying modes and mitigating noise effects. A drawback is the formation of hysteresis loops that signal a transition to unstable modes. This can only be alleviated by precise cavity symmetry management. Here, utilizing two coupled nonlinear RLC tanks with balanced amplification and attenuation, we demonstrate that an explicit symmetry violation, induced by sweeping the resonant detuning of the RLC tanks, reveals a hysteresis loop near the EPD whose width scales sublinearly with the inter-tank coupling. Our proposal re-envisions this disadvantageous feature as a sensing protocol with diverging sensitivity, enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, and self-calibration without requiring delicate symmetry control. As such, it opens new avenues in metrology as well as for optical or RF switching and triggering.         ",

This effect is comparatively small and requires high-precision theoretical calculations.

This method accounts for subtle differences in the nuclear potential while considering the $^{229}\\text{Th}$ isotope in both its ground and isomeric states. Consequently, the nuclear transition frequency difference of between $^{229}\\text{Th}^{3+}$ and $^{229}\\text{Th}^{4+}$ was determined to be $-639$~MHz with computational convergency down to 1~MHz. Given recent precision measured transition frequency of $^{229}\\text{Th}^{4+}$in $^{229}\\text{Th}$-doped CaF$_2$ [Nature 633, 63 (2024)], the transition frequency of isolated $^{229}\\text{Th}^{3+}$ is predicted to be $2,020,406,745 (1)_\\text{comp.}(77)_{\\delta \\langle r^2 \\rangle} (100)_\\text{ext.}$~MHz, with brackets indicating uncertainties stemming from our atomic structure computations, the input nuclear charge radii from nuclear data tables, and the influence of the crystal environment as reported in the literature.

The mask size, and consequently the lateral dimensions of the pillars, is precisely controlled through a chemical mechanical polishing step, obviating the need for any additional lithography step for creating the pillar. This fabrication technique offers several key advantages, including precise control over the pillar sites, and fully deterministic embedding of QD structures. The functionality of the structures was validated by integrating single In0.25Ga0.75As QDs - upon two-photon excitation of the biexciton state, the emission of single and polarization-entangled photon pairs was observed. Additionally, an extra fabrication step to deposit dome-like structures atop the pillars was demonstrated, effectively enhancing light extraction efficiency up to 12%.         ",

This oscillatory velocity couples with the modulated electron density to generate a linear current density, which resonantly excites terahertz surface magnetoplasmons. It is shown that the amplitude of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons wave can be tuned by adjusting the external magnetic field ($\\text{B}_{0}$), the graphene's Fermi energy ($\\text{E}_\\text{F}$), the semiconductor's temperature (T), and the incident angle ($\\theta$) of laser.

This package includes several features allowing for easy setup of zero- and finite-temperature calculations for general Hamiltonians using single and multi-set TTN ans\u00e4tze with an adaptive bond dimension through the use of subspace expansion techniques. All core features are implemented in C++ with Python bindings provided to simplify the use of this package. In addition to these core features, pyTTN provides several tools for setting up efficient simulation of open quantum system dynamics, including the use of the TTN ansatz to represent the auxiliary density operator space for the simulation of the Hierarchical Equation of Motion (HEOM) method and generalised pseudomode methods; furthermore we demonstrate that the two approaches are equivalent up to a non-unitary normal mode transformation acting on the pseudomode degrees of freedom. We present a set of applications of the package, starting with the widely used benchmark case of the photo-excitation dynamics of 24 mode pyrazine, following which we consider a more challenging model describing the exciton dynamics at the interface of a $n$-oligothiophene donor-C$_{60}$ fullerene acceptor system. Finally, we consider applications to open quantum systems, including the spin-boson model, a set of extended dissipative spin models, and an Anderson impurity model. By combining ease of use, an efficient implementation, as well as an extendable design allowing for the addition of future extensions, pyTTN can be integrated in a wide range of computational modelling software.

    "abstract": "           The study of optical systems with asymmetric responses has grown significantly due to their broad application potential in various fields. In particular, Janus metasurfaces are notable for their ability to control light asymmetrically at the pixel level within thin films. However, previous demonstrations were restricted to the partial control of asymmetric transmission for a limited set of input polarizations, focusing primarily on scalar functionalities. Here, we introduce optical metasurfaces consisting of bi-layer silicon nanostructures that can achieve a fully generalized form of asymmetric transmission for any possible input polarization. Their designs owe much to our theoretical model of asymmetric optical transmission in reciprocal systems that explicates the relationship between front- and back-side Jones matrices for general cases, revealing a fundamental correlation between the polarization-direction channels of opposing sides of incidence. To practically circumvent this constraint, we propose a method to partition transmission space, enabling the realization of four distinct vector functionalities within the target volume. As a proof of concept, we experimentally demonstrate polarization-direction-multiplexed Janus vector holograms generating four vector holograms. When integrated with computational vector polarizer arrays, this approach facilitates optical encryption with a high level of obscurity. We anticipate that our mathematical framework and novel material systems for generalized asymmetric transmission may pave the way for applications such as optical computations, sensing, and imaging.

Under this scale-invariance assumption, the effective diffusivity of a 2D turbulent flow is dimensionally controlled by the energy flux and the friction coefficient only. Surprisingly, however, we show that such scaling predictions are invalidated by numerical solutions of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation forced at intermediate wave number and damped by weak linear or quadratic drag. We derive alternate scaling-laws for the effective diffusivity based on the emergence of intense, isolated vortices causing spatially inhomogeneous frictional dissipation localized within the small vortex cores. The predictions quantitatively match DNS data. This study points to a universal large-scale organization of 2D turbulent flows in physical space, bridging standard 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence with large-scale geophysical turbulence.         ",
