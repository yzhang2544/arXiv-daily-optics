Show the applicability of a special soliton representation of quantum mechanics for modeling real entangled systems. Methodology. The central place in the study is occupied by the method of mathematical modeling. As part of the calculation of stochastics by the method of abstraction and concretization, a detailed mathematical apparatus is given, adapted to the real physical case. A qualitative analysis of the behavior of the material during the propagation of soliton pulses in it is carried out. Results. The main value of the stochastic theory for a system of entangled solitons lies in the possibility of modeling the entangled states of real systems - photons. In the framework of this work, the optical 1D envelopes of solitons in a nematic liquid crystal are considered in approximation to the conditions of a real physical problem. Research implications. The theoretical and/or practical significance lies in the fundamental possibility of modeling real entangled systems based on the constructed stochastic model of entangled solitons and subsequent creation of special applications on its basis. In particular, there will be a prospect of applying quantum teleportation to the problem of propagation of quantum computing for use among the components of quantum computing networks.         ",

    "abstract": "           Integrated coherent sources of ultra-violet (UV) light are essential for a wide range of applications, from ion-based quantum computing and optical clocks to gas sensing and microscopy. Conventional approaches that rely on UV gain materials face limitations in terms of wavelength versatility; in response frequency upconversion approaches that leverage various optical nonlinearities have received considerable attention. Among these, the integrated thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic platform shows particular promise owing to lithium niobate's transparency into the UV range, its strong second order nonlinearity, and high optical confinement. However, to date, the high propagation losses and lack of reliable techniques for consistent poling of cm-long waveguides with small poling periods have severely limited the utility of this platform. Here we present a sidewall poled lithium niobate (SPLN) waveguide approach that overcomes these obstacles and results in a more than two orders of magnitude increase in generated UV power compared to the state-of-the-art. Our UV SPLN waveguides feature record-low propagation losses of 2.3 dB/cm, complete domain inversion of the waveguide cross-section, and an optimum 50% duty cycle, resulting in a record-high normalized conversion efficiency of 5050 %W$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$, and 4.2 mW of generated on-chip power at 390 nm wavelength. This advancement makes the TFLN photonic platform a viable option for high-quality on-chip UV generation, benefiting emerging applications.         ",

We propose a novel quantum processing architecture based on dual-type, dual-element atom arrays, where individually trapped atoms serve as data qubits, and small atomic ensembles enable ancillary operations. By leveraging the selective initialization, coherent control, and collective optical response of atomic ensembles, we demonstrate ensemble-assisted quantum operations that enable reconfigurable, high-speed control of individual data qubits and rapid mid-circuit readout, including both projective single-qubit and joint multi-qubit measurements. The hybrid approach of this architecture combines the long coherence times of single-atom qubits with the enhanced controllability of atomic ensembles, achieving high-fidelity state manipulation and detection with minimal crosstalk. Numerical simulations indicate that our scheme supports individually addressable single- and multi-qubit operations with fidelities of 99.5% and 99.9%, respectively, as well as fast single- and multi-qubit state readout with fidelities exceeding 99% within tens of microseconds. These capabilities open new pathways toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation, enabling repetitive error syndrome detection and efficient generation of long-range entangled many-body states, thereby expanding the quantum information toolbox beyond existing platforms.

    "title": "On the decay instability of electron acoustic waves",
    "abstract": "           Electron acoustic waves (EAWs) are nonlinear plasma modes characterized by electron trapping, which suppresses the usual Landau damping. Despite being predicted in the 1990s, their excitation and decay mechanisms remain a subject of active research. This study investigates the nonlinear dynamics of EAWs, focusing on their excitation, decay instability, and the role of vortex merging in phase space. Using Eulerian Vlasov-Poisson simulations, we reproduce the excitation of stable EAWs via an external resonant driving force and explore their decay under the effect of a low-amplitude perturbation. The study identifies a distinct 2 to 1 decay process, where an EAW with a shorter wavelength merges into a longer-wavelength mode, driven by vortex dynamics in phase space. We find that the instability is triggered by a small fraction of particles capable of transitioning between potential wells, facilitating energy exchange between two adjacent phase space holes and vortex merging. Our simulations highlight the chaotic nature of particle trajectories in the vicinity of the separatrix between trapped and free phase space regions, which significantly contributes to the instability growth. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the perturbation amplitude on the growth rate of the instability, shedding light on the critical role of phase-space dynamics in the decay process. These findings offer a deeper understanding of the nonlinear behavior of plasma waves and suggest future directions for studying plasma wave stability in more complex systems, as the decay mechanism discussed here is likely to be universal in plasmas with closed separatrices in phase space, underscoring its significance in nonlinear plasma dynamics.

Through use of space-switched and wavelength-routed beamforming networks, which together with a photonic lantern provide a compact arrangement of up to 61 fine-pitched optical antenna elements on a fiber tip, we experimentally demonstrate that our FPA can assist the channel optimization of an FSO link after rough initial beam pointing.

However, traditional fabrication strategies often rely on lift-off processes, which inherently introduce imperfections in resonator shape and size distribution, ultimately limiting the resonance performance. Here, an optimized fabrication approach for vdW-metasurfaces is presented that implements inverse patterning of the etching mask, resulting in increased resonator quality solely limited by the resolution of the electron beam lithography resist and etching. Applying this inverse fabrication technique on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), quality (Q) factors exceeding $10^3$ in the visible spectral range were demonstrated, significantly surpassing previous results shown by lift-off fabricated structures. Additionally, the platforms potential as a biosensor was displayed, achieving competitive sensitivity and figure of merit of 220 in a refractive index sensing experiment. The inverse technique was applied to create chiral metasurfaces from hBN, using a two-height resonator geometry to achieve up to 50 % transmittance selectivity. This inverse lithography technique paves the way towards high-performances vdW-devices with high-Q resonances, establishing hBN as a cornerstone for next-generation nanophotonic and optoelectronic devices.

The cQRW framework enables precise tuning of quasi-energy spectra, supporting the emergence of localized edge states in topological band gaps and dispersive TBICs embedded within the bulk of other bands. These TBICs exhibit tunable group velocity, controllable excitation across energy regimes, and robustness, providing theoretical validation for their existence in a first-order Floquet system.

Here, we report the first non-perturbative, accurate microscopic model simulations of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex and demonstrate the presence of long-lived excitonic coherences at 77 K and room temperature, which persist on picosecond time scales, similar to those of excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, we show that full microscopic simulations of nonlinear optical spectra are essential for identifying experimental evidence of quantum effects in photosynthesis, as approximate theoretical methods can misinterpret experimental data and potentially overlook quantum phenomena.

    "abstract": "           Pyramid wavefront sensors (PWFSs) are the preferred choice for current and future extreme adaptive optics (XAO) systems. Almost all instruments use the PWFS in its modulated form to mitigate its limited linearity range. However, this modulation comes at the cost of a reduction in sensitivity, a blindness to petal-piston modes, and a limit to the sensor's ability to operate at high speeds. Therefore, there is strong interest to use the PWFS without modulation, which can be enabled with nonlinear reconstructors. Here, we present the first on-sky demonstration of XAO with an unmodulated PWFS using a nonlinear reconstructor based on convolutional neural networks. We discuss the real-time implementation on the Magellan Adaptive Optics eXtreme (MagAO-X) instrument using the optimized TensorRT framework and show that inference is fast enough to run the control loop at >2 kHz frequencies. Our on-sky results demonstrate a successful closed-loop operation using a model calibrated with internal source data that delivers stable and robust correction under varying conditions. Performance analysis reveals that our smart PWFS achieves nearly the same Strehl ratio as the highly optimized modulated PWFS under favorable conditions on bright stars. Notably, we observe an improvement in performance on a fainter star under the influence of strong winds. These findings confirm the feasibility of using the PWFS in its unmodulated form and highlight its potential for next-generation instruments. Future efforts will focus on achieving even higher control loop frequencies (>3 kHz), optimizing the calibration procedures, and testing its performance on fainter stars, where more gain is expected for the unmodulated PWFS compared to its modulated counterpart.

A simultaneous eigenfunction of both the Dirac Hamiltonian and the electric moment spin operator is constructed. Expressions for the electric moment states and the corresponding vertex functions are derived. It is shown that when the distribution of momenta is isotropic, the spin dependent response of an electric moment dependent quantum plasma is identically zero. The response is non-zero in the presence of a streaming motion perpendicular to the axis if the electron and positron distributions are different. The response has the same form as for a plasma with a nonzero, cross field current when $\\langle p_{i} \\rangle \\neq 0$. This quantum relativistic correction is used to identify the dispersion equation for an electric moment spin polarised plasma with a streaming cold plasma background. In particular, the natural modes of an electric moment dependent quantum plasma exhibit elliptical polarisation. This is in contrast to a magnetic moment dependent electron gas, which is gyrotropic, or a helicity dependent electron gas which is optically active. The different responses, due to quantum plasmas being spin polarised by different relativistically acceptable spin operators, does not appear in other approaches to quantum plasma theory.         ",

Here, we propose that the single photon temporal shape can be converted through the multi-photon wavepacket interference on a single metasurface. By selecting appropriate input single-photon temporal shapes and metasurfaces beam splitting ratio, controllable photon shape conversion can be achieved with high fidelity. For examples, photons with an exponentially decaying profile can be shaped into a Gaussian profile; by tuning the relative time delays of input photons, Gaussian-shaped photons can be transformed into exponentially decaying or rising profiles through the same metasurface. The proposed mechanism provides a compact way for solving the temporal shape mismatch issues in quantum networks, facilitating the realization of high-fidelity on-chip quantum information processing.

    "title": "Addressing misconceptions in university physics: A review and experiences from quantum physics educators",
    "abstract": "           Students often begin physics courses with misconceptions rooted in everyday experience and intuition, which can be resistant to change. While research has identified strategies for addressing misconceptions across physics, it remains unclear whether different domains, like classical and quantum physics, require different approaches. On one hand, quantum concepts are further removed from daily experience, possibly requiring specialized strategies. On the other, all physics must be learned rather than innately understood, and classical physics already contains many counterintuitive ideas, suggesting the same strategies may be equally valid. To explore this question, we first develop a structure to organize the existing literature on addressing misconceptions in physics education. We identify 126 studies, which we group into six categories, three of which include further subcategories. Rather than offering a comprehensive literature review, this scheme provides a structural lens through which to compare how various strategies align. We then take an instructor-centered approach, using our framework to guide interviews with quantum physics instructors. We interview 12 instructors from the University of Waterloo's Institute for Quantum Computing and the Perimeter Institute who have collectively taught over 100 quantum courses. Our findings suggest that quantum physics instructors find strategies similar to those used in classical physics effective for identifying and addressing misconceptions. This highlights the potential to adapt, rather than replace, existing instructional tools to better meet the conceptual challenges of quantum physics. Our work provides practical insights for educators and curriculum designers aiming to support deeper understanding in quantum mechanics.         ",

    "abstract": "           An inter-combination transition in Yb enables a novel approach for rapidly imaging magnetic field variations with excellent spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy. This quantum imaging magnetometer reveals \"dark stripes\" that are contours of constant magnetic field visible by eye or capturable by standard cameras. These dark lines result from a combination of Autler-Townes splitting and the spatial Hanle effect in the $^{1}S_{0} - ^{3}P_{1}$ transition of Yb when driven by multiple strong coherent laser fields (carrier and AM/FM modulation sidebands of a single-mode 556 nm laser). We show good agreement between experimental data and our theoretical model for the closed, 4-level Zeeman shifted V-system and demonstrate scalar and vector magnetic fields measurements at video frame rates over spatial dimensions of 5 cm with 0.1 mm resolution. Additionally, the $^{1}S_{0} - ^{3}P_{1}$ transition allows for $\\sim\\mu$s response time and a large dynamic range (from microtesla to many tesla).         ",

    "abstract": "           Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate an upconversion system that converts low-intensity (down to ~10-7 W/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. To enable high-resolution imaging, the upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.         ",

    "title": "Field-free, Quasi-continuous Operation of Optical Nanofiber Interface with Two-dimensional Ferromagnetic Trap",
    "abstract": "           A soft ferromagnetic foil uniformizes Tesla-level magnetic fields generated by attached permanent magnets, producing a uniform and electronically tunable surface field on the opposite side. By arranging $n$ precisely fabricated rectangular foils, a nearly ideal magnetic quadrupole field with a substantial gradient can be created at center. This robust and tunable field configuration is useful for 2-dimensional magneto-optical trapping (2D-MOT) and magnetic guiding of cold atoms. In this work, by aligning an optical nanofiber (ONF) to the zero-field line of a 2-foil-based planar 2D-MOT, we demonstrate field-free operation of the quantum optical interface in a quasi-continuous manner, without switching off the magnetic field. Transient transmission spectroscopy is performed with a measurement repetition rate as high as 250~kHz. An anomalous line broadening is observed, which is not fully understood, but is partly explained by a small residual field along the zero-field line. Through additional field measurements and simulations, we clarify that this residual field can be eliminated in an $n$=4 assembly, resulting in an ultra-straight 2D trap to support efficient sub-Doppler cooling and uniform light-atom interaction over exceptionally long field-free distances $l$. With the strong field gradient to support atom guiding, the ferromagnetic device may also enable new quantum optical scenarios featuring interactions between co-guided atoms and photons.         ",

    "abstract": "           This study presents a novel discretely dielectric material-coated (DDMC) dipole antenna design for ultra-high-field (UHF) MRI applications. This design improves frequency tuning, lowers electric field intensity, and reduces SAR by including discrete high-permittivity dielectric coatings at both ends of the dipole. The DDMC dipole's performance was compared to that of a fractionated dipole design using metrics such as inter-element coupling, B1 field distribution, and SNR. Simulations and experimental results showed that the DDMC dipole provided superior B1 field uniformity with significantly reduced B1 variation along the dipole conductor while reducing SAR, making it a safer and more efficient option for MR signal excitation and reception in UHF MR imaging. Furthermore, with its improved electromagnetic decoupling performance, the multichannel array made from the proposed DDMC dipoles shows promise for improving parallel imaging and imaging quality in UHF MRI, with future work focusing on material optimization and scalability for multi-channel arrays.

    "title": "Observation of the acoustic Purcell effect with a color-center and a nanomechanical resonator",
    "abstract": "           The radiative properties of atoms are inherently linked to their surrounding environment. Placing an electromagnetic resonator around atoms can enhance spontaneous emission, as shown by Purcell in the 1940s. This approach is now routinely used in quantum computing and communication to channel photons emitted by atoms into well-defined modes and control atom-photon interactions. For solid-state artificial atoms, such as color-centers, the host lattice introduces an acoustic environment, allowing excited atoms to relax by emitting phonons. Here we observe the acoustic Purcell effect by constructing a specially engineered, microwave-frequency nanomechanical resonator around a color-center spin qubit in diamond. Using a co-localized optical mode of the structure that strongly couples to the color-center's excited state, we perform single-photon-level laser spectroscopy at milliKelvin temperatures and observe ten-fold faster spin relaxation when the spin qubit is tuned into resonance with a 12 GHz acoustic mode. Additionally, we use the color-center as an atomic-scale probe to measure the broadband phonon spectrum of the nanostructure up to a frequency of 28 GHz. Our work establishes a new regime of control for quantum defects in solids and paves the way for interconnects between atomic-scale quantum memories and qubits encoded in acoustic and superconducting devices.
