Their intrinsic nonlinearities can be strengthened further by coupling QDs to low mode-volume photonic nanocavities, enabling low-power, on-chip nonlinear optics. In this paper, we demonstrated cavity-enhanced second harmonic generation via integration of colossal QDs with a silicon nitride nanobeam cavity. By pumping the cavity-QD system with an ultrafast pulsed laser, we observed a strong second harmonic generation from the cavity-coupled QD, and we estimate an enhancement factor of ~3,040. Our work, coupled with previously reported deterministic positioning of colossal QDs, can enable a scalable QD-cavity platform for low-power nonlinear optics.         ",

    "abstract": "           The ever-increasing volume of data has necessitated a new computing paradigm, embodied through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Digital electronic AI computing systems, however, are gradually reaching their physical plateaus, stimulating extensive research towards next-generation AI accelerators. Photonic Neural Networks (PNNs), with their unique ability to capitalize on the interplay of multiple physical dimensions including time, wavelength, and space, have been brought forward with a credible promise for boosting computational power and energy efficiency in AI processors. In this article, we experimentally demonstrate a novel multidimensional arrayed waveguide grating router (AWGR)-based photonic AI accelerator that can execute tensor multiplications at a record-high total computational power of 262 TOPS, offering a ~24x improvement over the existing waveguide-based optical accelerators. It consists of a 16x16 AWGR that exploits the time-, wavelength- and space- division multiplexing (T-WSDM) for weight and input encoding together with an integrated Si3N4-based frequency comb for multi-wavelength generation. The photonic AI accelerator has been experimentally validated in both Fully-Connected (FC) and Convolutional NN (NNs) models, with the FC and CNN being trained for DDoS attack identification and MNIST classification, respectively. The experimental inference at 32 Gbaud achieved a Cohen's kappa score of 0.867 for DDoS detection and an accuracy of 92.14% for MNIST classification, respectively, closely matching the software performance.

    "abstract": "           Topological singularities of optical response functions -- such as reflection amplitudes -- enable elegant practical applications ranging from analog signal processing to novel molecular sensing approaches. A phase singularity-based refractometric sensor monitors the rapidly evolving argument of the optical field near the point of phase singularity, in contrast to the reflection zero in traditional surface plasmon polariton sensors. This raises a natural question: What happens with the sensitivity and resolution of such a sensor when it operates close to a zero of the response function, where the detected signal may be greatly influenced by various noise sources? In this paper, we systematically study the effect of the shot noise on the performance of a generic phase singularity-based refractometric sensor. We develop a theoretical model of a spectroscopic ellipsometry-based system operating near a phase singularity and couple the macroscopic optical picture of the detection with a quantum shot noise model. Within the developed model, we illustrate how the shot noise of the detector comes into play and study its effect on the sensitivity and resolution of the refractometric sensor. Our results suggest that such an ellipsometry-based phase singularity sensor remains stable even in the presence of shot noise near the point of zero reflection.         ",

    "abstract": "           The possibility of the breaking of Lorentz symmetry has been discussed in many models of quantum gravity. In this paper we follow the Lorentz violation model in Ref. [1] (i.e., our previous work) to discuss the Doppler frequency shift of photons and the Compton scattering process between photons and electrons, pointing out that following the idea in Ref. [1] we have to modify the usual quantum relation of photons in the Doppler effect. But due to the current limited information and knowledge, we could not yet determine the specific expression for the correction coefficient in the modified quantum relation of photons. However, the phenomenon called spontaneous radiation in a cyclotron maser give us an opportunity to see what the expression for this correction coefficient might look like. Therefor, under some necessary constraints, we construct a very concise expression for this correction coefficient through the discussion of different cases. And then we use this expression to analyze the wavelength of radiation in the cyclotron maser, which tends to a limited value at v is close to c, rather than to 0 as predicted by the Lorentz model. And the inverse Compton scattering phenomenon is also discussed and we find that there is a limit to the maximum energy that can be obtained by photons in the collision between extremely relativistic particles and low-energy photons, which conclusion is also very different from that obtained from the Lorentz model, in which the energy that can be obtained by the photon tends to be infinite as the velocity of particle is close to c. This paper still follows the purpose in Ref. [1] that the energy and momentum of particles (i.e., any particles, including photons) cannot be infinite, otherwise it will make some physical scenarios invalid.         ",

This alternating configuration enables the systematic tailoring of both the network's depth (number of layers) and width (size of each layer) without compromising computational capabilities. From a mathematical perspective, our approach can be viewed as embedding an arbitrary target matrix into a higher-dimensional matrix, which can then be represented with fewer layers and larger active elements. We derive a general relation for the width and depth of a network that guarantees representing all $N \\times N$ complex matrix operations. Remarkably, we show that just two such active layers, interleaved with passive mixing layers, are sufficient to universally implement arbitrary matrix transformations. This result promises a more adaptable and scalable route to photonic matrix processors.         ",

By employing Bayesian optimization techniques, the beamline was optimized to achieve sufficient tolerance against these fluctuations under actual experimental conditions. Start-to-end simulations revealed that this systematic optimization significantly reduces the system's sensitivity to parametric variations. With the optimized configurations, the radiation energy can be maintained above 1 {\\mu}J at a wavelength of approximately 25 nm, even when accounting for twice the root-mean-square (RMS) ranges of these inherent jitters.

The ITk will consist of a central pixel tracker and the outer strip tracker, consisting of about 19,000 strip detector modules. Each strip module is assembled from up to two sensors, and up to five flexes (depending on its geometry) in a series of gluing, wirebonding and quality control steps. During detector operation, modules will be cooled down to temperatures of about -35C (corresponding to the temperature of the support structures on which they will be mounted) after being initially assembled and stored at room temperature. In order to ensure compatibility with the detector's operating temperature range, modules are subjected to thermal cycling as part of their quality control process. Ten cycles between -35C and +40C are performed for each module, with full electrical characterisation tests at each high and low temperature point. As part of an investigation into the stress experienced by modules during cooling, it was observed that modules generally showed a change in module shape before and after thermal cycling. This paper presents a summary of the discovery and understanding of the observed changes, connecting them with excess module stress, as well as the resulting modifications to the module thermal cycling procedure.

    "abstract": "           Acoustic cavitation threshold charts are used to map between acoustic parameters (mainly intensity and frequency) and different regimes of acoustic cavitation. The two main regimes are transient cavitation, where a bubble collapses, and stable cavitation, where a bubble undergoes periodic oscillations without collapse. The cavitation charts strongly depend on the physical model used to compute the bubble dynamics and the algorithm for classifying the cavitation threshold. The differences between modeling approaches become especially noticeable for resonant bubbles and when sonication parameters result in large-amplitude oscillations. This paper proposes a machine learning approach that integrates three physical models, i.e., the Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Miksis and Gilmore equations, and multiple cavitation classification techniques. Specifically, we classify the cavitation regimes based on the maximum radius, the acoustic Mach number, the kurtosis factor of acoustic emissions, and the Flynn criterion on the inertial and pressure functions. Four machine learning strategies were developed to predict the likelihood of the transient and stable cavitation, using equally weighted contributions from classification techniques. By solving the differential equations for bubble dynamics across a range of sonication and material parameters and applying cross-validation on held-out test data, our framework demonstrates high predictive accuracy for cavitation regimes. This physics-informed machine learning approach offers probabilistic insights into cavitation likelihood, combining diverse physical models and classification strategies, each contributing different levels of physical rigor and interpretability.

This work highlights the emerging potential of quantum computing in geophysical applications, providing a foundation for future developments in high-precision seismic imaging.         ",

    "abstract": "           X-ray Free Electron Lasers (X\\nobreakdash-FELs) operate in a wide range of lasing configurations for a broad variety of scientific applications at ultrafast time-scales such as structural biology, materials science, and atomic and molecular physics. Shot-by-shot characterization of the X-FEL pulses is crucial for analysis of many experiments as well as tuning the X-FEL performance. However, for the weak pulses found in advanced configurations, e.g. those needed for coherent, two-pulse studies of quantum materials, there is no current method for reliably resolving pulse profiles. Here we show that a physics-based U-net model can reconstruct the individual pulse power profiles for sub-picosecond pulse separation without the need for simulations. Using experimental data from weak X-FEL pulse pairs, we demonstrate we can learn the pulse characteristics on a shot-by-shot basis when conventional methods fail.         ",

    "title": "Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement learning",
    "abstract": "           Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Light-matter interactions lie at the heart of our exploration of exoplanetary atmospheres. Interpreting data obtained by remote sensing is enabled by meticulous, time- and resource-consuming work aiming at deepening our understanding of such interactions (i.e., opacity models). Recently, Niraula et al. 2022 pointed out that due primarily to limitations on our modeling of broadening and far-wing behaviors, opacity models needed a timely update for exoplanet exploration in the JWST era, and thus argued for a scalable approach. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce an end-to-end solution from \\textsl{ab initio} calculations to pressure broadening, and use a perturbation framework to identify the need for precision to a level of $\\sim$10\\%. We focus on the CO$_2$-H$_2$ system as CO$_2$ is a key absorption feature for exoplanet research (primarily in many gas giants) at $\\sim$4.3$\\mu$m as pressure-broadening parameters required for interpreting such observations remain sparse. We compute elastic and inelastic cross-sections for the collision of {ortho-}H$_2$~with CO$_2$, in the ground vibrational state, and at the coupled-channel fully converged level. For scattering energies above $\\sim$20~cm$^{-1}$, moderate precision inter-molecular potentials are indistinguishable from high precision ones in cross-sections. Our calculations agree with the currently available measurement within 7\\%, i.e., well beyond the precision requirements.         ",

We have proposed a quantum algorithm of the multislice method based on quantum circuit model previously. In this work we have developed an improved quantum algorithm. We reconstruct the phase-shifting quantum circuit without using the multi-controlled quantum gates, thereby significantly improve the computation efficiency. The new quantum circuit also allows further gate count reduction at the cost of a controllable error. We have simulated the quantum circuit on a classical supercomputer and analyzed the result to prove the feasibility and correctness of the improved quantum algorithm. We also provide proper parameter settings through testing, allowing the minimization of the necessary number of quantum gates while limiting the relative error within 1%. This work demonstrates the potential of applying quantum computing to electron diffraction simulations and achieving quantum advantages.         ",
