    "title": "Schematic Representation Method for Quantum Circuits: An Intuitive Approach to Quantum Gate Effects",
    "abstract": "           In quantum circuits, qubits and the quantum gates acting on them have traditionally been analysed using matrix algebra and Dirac notation. While powerful, these can be unintuitive for conceptual understanding and rapid problem solving. In this work, a new schematic representation method is developed that visualizes the effects of quantum gates on qubits without relying on complex mathematical operations. In the new notation, quantum bits (qubits) are represented using black (0) and white (1) circles. When a quantum gate is applied to a qubit, the circle representing the qubit is visually modified. For example, a Hadamard gate transforms a solid black or white circle into a half-black and half-white circle representing superposition. The work shows how this method simplifies the visualization of quantum algorithms, entanglement, and multi-qubit operations. Thus, the effects of quantum circuits can be analysed with simple schematic representations without having to go into complex mathematical operations.         ",

    "abstract": "           Recent years have witnessed a surge of experimental and theoretical interest in controlling the properties of matter, such as its chemical reactivity, by confining it in optical cavities, where the enhancement of the light-matter coupling strength leads to the creation of hybrid light-matter states known as polaritons. However, ab initio calculations that account for the quantum nature of both the electromagnetic field and matter are challenging and have only started to be developed in recent years. We introduce a deep learning variational quantum Monte Carlo method to solve the electronic and photonic Schr\u00f6dinger equation of molecules trapped in optical cavities. We extend typical electronic neural network wavefunction ansatzes to describe joint fermionic and bosonic systems, i.e. electron-photon systems, in a quantum Monte Carlo framework. We apply our method to hydrogen molecules in a cavity, computing both ground and excited states. We assess their energy, dipole moment, charge density shift due to the cavity, the state of the photonic field, and the entanglement developed between the electrons and photons. When possible, we compare our results with more conventional quantum chemistry methods proposed in the literature, finding good qualitative agreement, thus extending the range of scientific problems that can be tackled using machine learning techniques.

Here, we push the limits of silicon tracking detectors by targeting an unprecedentedly low material budget of 2%-7% $X_0$ in an 8-layer 4 m$^2$ detector designed for high-occupancy environments ($\\leq$ 10 MHz/cm$^2$). To achieve this, we employ Double-Sided Double Metal (DSDM) silicon microstrip sensors, coupled with readout electronics capable of precise timing and energy measurements. These 320 $\\mu$m thick sensors, featuring $2\\times 1024$ channels with a 58 $\\mu$m pitch, are connected via ultra-lightweight aluminium-polyimide microcables for signal transmission and integrated with a custom SMX readout ASIC, operating in free-streaming mode.

The primary application of this technology is the Silicon Tracking System (STS) for the CBM experiment, with additional potential in projects like the J-PARC E16 experiment and future uses in medical physics, such as advanced imaging telescopes. In this contribution, we present the current status of CBM STS construction, with almost one-third of the modules produced and tested.

We rigorously derive effective classical kinematics under such measurements, demonstrating that when the volume of the coarse-grained slot in phase space significantly exceeds Planck's constant, quantum states can be effectively described by classical probability distributions. Furthermore, we show that the dynamics, derived under coarse-grained observations and the linear approximation of the quantum Hamiltonian around its classical values within the slots, is effectively described by a classical Hamiltonian following Liouville dynamics. The classical Hamiltonian obtained through this process is equivalent to the one from which the underlying quantum Hamiltonian is derived via the (Dirac) quantization procedure, completing the quantization-classical limit loop. The Ehrenfest time, marking the duration within which classical behavior remains valid, is analyzed for various physical systems. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of both macroscopic and microscopic systems, revealing the mechanisms behind their observed classicality.

We model the light-matter interaction, analyze the twist dynamics, and develop a phase diagram for optical twist angle switching -- transition to a neighboring metastable twist angle -- by mapping the system onto an impulsively forced nonlinear pendulum. Aided by pairwise classical potential estimates for the interlayer energy and numerical simulation, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with hexagonal boron nitride bilayers and extend the results to dichalcogenides with first-principles calculations. Our findings reveal a rich dynamical response -- from single-pulse twist angle control to high-order quasistable orbits pointing toward periodically driven chaotic dynamics -- and suggest a pathway for all-optical measurement of the twist potential energy.

Crystal structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (Rietveld analysis) and investigated samples possess the MgCu$_{2}$-type single phase with Fd-3m space group. Melt-spinning process introduced a chemical and topological disorder, which directly affected the magnetic properties. Refrigerant capacity (RC), strictly connected to the full width at half maximum $\\delta$TFWHM of the $\\Delta$S$_M$(T) curve and the maximum of magnetic entropy changes $\\Delta$S$_{Mpk}$(T)(T,$\\Delta$H), increases from 29 to 148 J/kg with replacement of Y by Gd atoms from x = 0.2 to x = 0.8.

Temperature dependences of magnetic entropy change $\\Delta$S$_M$(T,$\\Delta$H) and RC were measured in as-quenched and annealed state for Y$_{0.4}$Gd$_{0.6}$Co$_{2}$.

The phase transition temperature increases with increasing Gd content from 74 to 407 K for Y$_{0.8}$Gd$_{0.2}$Co$_{2}$ and GdCo2, respectively. Within the FPLO-LDA DFT method, the non-magnetic ground state for YCo$_{2}$ and the magnetic ground state for GdCo$_{2}$ are predicted in agreement with experiment.

In the generalized CPS formulation for the mapping Hamiltonian of the classical mapping model with commutator variables (CMMcv) method [\\textit{J. Phys. Chem.

We employ covariant kernels {within the generalized CPS framework} to develop two approaches that naturally yield exact evaluation of time correlation functions (TCFs) for pure discrete (electronic) DOFs. In addition, we briefly discuss the phase space mapping formalisms where the contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression of the {TCF} of population dynamics is strictly positive semi-definite.

However, due to the interaction with the external environment, it will lead to decoherence and thus reduce the lifetime of QBs. Here, we propose suppressing the environmental dissipation in the energy-storage process of the QB by exploiting the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) and bound states. By constructing a hybrid system composed of a four-level atom and a coupled-cavity array, two bound states are formed in the system when the energy of the QB is in the energy band of the cavity array. Due to the bound states and the EIT effect, the ambient dissipation is significantly suppressed, which improves the lifetime of the QB. In addition, we show that when the energy of the QB is in resonance with the cavity, the ergotropy of the QB reaches the maximum. Furthermore, there exists an optimal coupling strength between two neighbouring cavities which helps improve the performance of the QB. These discoveries may shed the light on the design of high-efficiency QBs.         ",

We first examine how the dynamics under EAP violations affects classical systems and show that new laboratory tests can be performed, to improve over the current experimental bounds and to test new manifestations of EAP violations. We then extend the analysis to the quantum domain, where quantized energy contributes to mass and the EAP principle can thus shed light on how quantum source masses would gravitate. We show that experiments with cold polar molecules, and future experiments with nuclear atomic clocks, can test the quantum EAP in a regime where quantum gravity phenomenology could become relevant. Our results open new opportunities for fundamental tests of gravity in high-precision laboratory experiments that can shed light on foundational principles of gravity and its interface with quantum theory.

    "abstract": "           Cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the optical properties of materials at the nanoscale, offering unique insights into the behavior of photonic and plasmonic materials under electron excitation. We introduce an atlas of bulk CL spectra and intensity for a broad range of materials used in photonics and plasmonics. Through a combination of experimental CL microscopy and Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize spectra and intensity of coherent and incoherent CL, electron penetration depth and energy deposition, offering a foundational reference for interpreting CL signals and understanding material behavior under electron excitation. Our atlas captures CL signals across a wide range of materials, offering valuable insight into intrinsic emission properties for informed material selection and device design in photonics and plasmonics.

    "title": "Detectorless 3D terahertz imaging: achieving subwavelength resolution with reflectance confocal interferometric microscopy",
    "abstract": "           Terahertz imaging holds great potential for non-destructive material inspection, but practical implementation has been limited by resolution constraints. In this study, we present a single-pixel THz imaging system based on a confocal microscope architecture, utilising a quantum cascade laser as both transmitter and phase-sensitive receiver. Our approach integrates laser feedback interferometry detection to achieve a two-fold improvement in lateral resolution and a two-order-of-magnitude enhancement in axial resolution over conventional imaging through precise interferometric phase measurements. This translates to a lateral resolution near $\\lambda/2$ and a depth of focus better than $\\lambda/5$, significantly outperforming traditional confocal systems. The system can produce a 0.5 Mpixel image in under two minutes, surpassing both raster-scanning single-pixel and multipixel focal-plane array-based imagers. Coherent operation enables simultaneous amplitude and phase image acquisition, and a custom visualisation method links amplitude to image saturation and phase to hue, enhancing material characterisation. A 3D tomographic analysis of a silicon chip reveals subwavelength features, demonstrating the system's potential for high-resolution THz imaging and material analysis. This work sets a new benchmark for THz imaging, overcoming key challenges and opening up transformative possibilities for non-destructive material inspection and characterisation.         ",

    "title": "Fast, accurate, and error-resilient variational quantum noise spectroscopy",
    "abstract": "           Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing scalable quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors that operate at molecular scales. Yet, existing methods for such noise spectroscopy face fundamental difficulties, including their reliance on severe approximations and the need for extensively averaged measurements. Here, we propose an alternative approach that processes the commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements using a novel self-consistent optimization framework to extract the noise power spectrum that characterizes the interaction between a qubit or quantum sensor and its environment. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is robust to the presence of measurement errors. We introduce a protocol to quantify confidence intervals and a physically motivated heuristic to determine which new dynamical decoupling measurement can improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that the previous measurements of low-frequency noise had overestimated its strength by an order of magnitude. Our method's noise spectrum reconstructions uncover previously unsuspected structure and offer unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.

    "title": "Symmetry Analysis of the Non-Hermitian Electro-Optic Effect in Crystals",
    "abstract": "           Here, we investigate how crystal symmetry tailors the non-Hermitian electro-optic effect arising from the Berry curvature dipole. Specifically, we demonstrate the critical influence of the material's point group symmetry and external electric biases in shaping this effect, leading to current-induced optical gain and non-reciprocal optical responses. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the crystallographic point groups, we identify how different symmetries affect the electro-optic response, enabling the engineering of polarization-dependent optical gain without the need for gyrotropic effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian electro-optic response in a broad class of crystals is characterized by linear dichroic gain. In this type of response, the eigenpolarizations that activate the gain or dissipation are linearly polarized. Depending on the point group symmetry, it is possible to achieve gain (or dissipation) for all eigenpolarizations or to observe polarization-dependent gain and dissipation. Weyl semimetals emerge as promising candidates for realizing significant non-Hermitian electro-optic effects and linear dichroic gain. We further examine practical applications by studying the reflectance of biased materials in setups involving mirrors, demonstrating how optical gain and attenuation can be controlled via symmetry and bias configurations.
