    "title": "Rothe Time Propagation for Coupled Electronic and Rovibrational Quantum Dynamics",
    "abstract": "           When time-propagating a wave packet representing a molecular system interacting with strong attosecond laser pulses, one needs to use an approach that is capable of describing intricate coupled electronic-nuclear events that require departure from the conventional adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. Hence, the propagation should be carried out simultaneously for the electrons and nuclei, treating both particle types on an equal footing \\emph{without} invoking the BO approximation. In such calculations, in order to achieve high accuracy, the wave packet needs to be expanded in basis functions that explicitly depend on interparticle distances, such as all-particle explicitly correlated Gaussians (ECGs). In our previous work, we employed basis sets consisting of ECGs with optimizable complex exponential parameters to fit time-dependent wave functions obtained from grid-based propagations of two model systems: a nucleus in a Morse potential and an electron in a central-field Coulomb-like potential, subjected to intense laser pulses. In this work, we present a proof-of-principle study of the time propagation of linear combinations of ECGs for these two models using Rothe's method. It is shown that the approach very closely reproduce the virtually exact results of grid-based propagation for both systems. This provides further evidence that ECGs constitute a viable alternative to purely grid-based simulations of coupled nuclear-electronic dynamics driven by intense laser pulses.         ",

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a novel paradigm in generative machine learning, capable of producing new samples that closely mimic observed data. These models learn the gradient of model probabilities, bypassing the need for cumbersome calculations of partition functions across all possible configurations. We explore whether diffusion models can enhance parameter inference by augmenting small datasets. Our findings demonstrate this potential through a synthetic task involving inverse Ising inference and a real-world application of reconstructing missing values in neural activity data.

The result is valid for small amplitude bubble oscillations without restriction on the size of the viscous boundary layer $(2{\\nu}/{\\omega})^{(1/2)}$ in comparison to the bubble radius. The nonspherical distortions of the bubble interface are decomposed over the set of orthonormal spherical harmonics ${Y_n^m} ({\\theta},{\\phi})$ of degree $n$ and order $m$. The present theory describes the steady flow produced by the nonspherical oscillations $(n,{\\pm}m)$ that occur at a frequency different from that of the spherical oscillation as in the case of a parametrically-excited surface oscillation.

The use of terahertz (THz) carrier frequencies is considered to achieve faster data transmission rates, with the potential to reach terabits per second. However, there is a necessity to study the impact of environmental factors affecting the signal transmission at these frequencies. One key challenge of THz signal propagation through air is water vapor absorption, which can severely limit the broadcast distance of THz wireless communications. In this work, we investigate the propagation distance of several THz channels under 35 % relative humidity atmospheric conditions using a table-top THz spectroscopy apparatus equipped with a sensitive THz detection system based on nonlinear parametric upconversion. Our results show seven transmission bands between 1 and 3 THz with negligible signal absorption at different propagation lengths with potential application in short-, mid- and long-range wireless communications.

    "abstract": "           The rapid expansion of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has driven the demand for faster optical components in data centres to unprecedented levels. A key advancement in this field is the integration of multiple photonic components onto a single chip, enhancing the performance of optical transceivers. Here, silicon photonics, benefiting from mature fabrication processes, has gained prominence. The platform combines modulators, switches, photodetectors and low-loss waveguides on a single chip. However, emerging standards like 1600ZR+ potentially exceed the capabilities of silicon-based modulators. To address these limitations, thin-film lithium niobate has been proposed as an alternative to silicon photonics, offering a low voltage-length product and exceptional high-speed modulation properties. More recently, the first demonstrations of thin-film lithium tantalate circuits have emerged, addressing some of the disadvantages of lithium niobate enabling a reduced bias drift and enhanced resistance to optical damage. As such, making it a promising candidate for next-generation photonic platforms. However, a persistent drawback of such platforms is the lithium contamination, which complicates integration with CMOS fabrication processes. Here, we present for the first time the integration of lithium tantalate onto a silicon photonics chip. This integration is achieved without modifying the standard silicon photonics process design kit. Our device achieves low half-wave voltage (3.5 V), low insertion loss (2.9 dB) and high-speed operation (> 70 GHz), paving the way for next-gen applications. By minimising lithium tantalate material use, our approach reduces costs while leveraging existing silicon photonics technology advancements, in particular supporting ultra-fast monolithic germanium photodetectors and established process design kits.

    "abstract": "           Solving challenging problems in quantum chemistry is one of the leading promised applications of quantum computers. Within the quantum algorithms proposed for problems in excited state quantum chemistry, subspace-based quantum algorithms, including quantum subspace expansion (QSE), quantum equation of motion (qEOM) and quantum self-consistent equation-of-motion (q-sc-EOM), are promising for pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices. The working equation of QSE and qEOM requires solving a generalized eigenvalue equation with associated matrix elements measured on a quantum computer. Our quantitative analysis of the QSE method shows that the errors in eigenvalues increase drastically with an increase in the condition number of the overlap matrix when a generalized eigenvalue equation is solved in the presence of statistical sampling errors. This makes such methods unstable to errors that are unavoidable when using quantum computers. Further, at very high condition numbers of overlap matrix, the QSE's working equation could not be solved without any additional steps in the presence of sampling errors as it becomes ill-conditioned. It was possible to use the thresholding technique in this case to solve the equation, but the solutions achieved had missing excited states, which may be a problem for future chemical studies. We also show that excited-state methods that have an eigenvalue equation as the working equation, such as q-sc-EOM, do not have such problems and could be suitable candidates for excited-state quantum chemistry calculations using quantum computers.

The origin of this crucial element stems from nonlinear dipole and magnetostrictive interactions in MMS. Magnomechanical characteristics such as magnon-photon and magnon-phonon couplings have a strong impact on both refractive and group index profile spectra. We also explore that lateral light drag shows a strong dependence on detuning by altering the amplitude and direction of the translational velocity. This enabled us to alter the light's propagation within the magnomechanical system from superluminal to subluminal and vice versa by adjusting the probe's detuning. The ability to control and manipulate the light drag through the MMS could be helpful in designing novel devices with improved functionality at the microscopic scale.         ",

Placing an electromagnetic resonator around atoms can enhance spontaneous emission, as shown by Purcell in the 1940s. This approach is now routinely used in quantum computing and communication to channel photons emitted by atoms into well-defined modes and control atom-photon interactions. For solid-state artificial atoms, such as color-centers, the host lattice introduces an acoustic environment, allowing excited atoms to relax by emitting phonons. Here we observe the acoustic Purcell effect by constructing a specially engineered, microwave-frequency nanomechanical resonator around a color-center spin qubit in diamond. Using a co-localized optical mode of the structure that strongly couples to the color-center's excited state, we perform single-photon-level laser spectroscopy at milliKelvin temperatures and observe ten-fold faster spin relaxation when the spin qubit is tuned into resonance with a 12 GHz acoustic mode. Additionally, we use the color-center as an atomic-scale probe to measure the broadband phonon spectrum of the nanostructure up to a frequency of 28 GHz. Our work establishes a new regime of control for quantum defects in solids and paves the way for interconnects between atomic-scale quantum memories and qubits encoded in acoustic and superconducting devices.

Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses driven by complex frequency excitations. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are sensitive to the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function.

    "title": "Towards Flexible Intensity Control of Resonantly Scattered $\u03b3$-Rays Using Multi-Frequency Vibrating Resonant Absorber",
    "abstract": "           We report a method for coherent control of $\\gamma$-photons, enabling the shaping of $\\gamma$-ray intensity in nearly arbitrary waveforms. Different intensity waveforms are created by adjusting the motion profile of a resonant absorber (an ensemble of M\u00f6ssbauer nuclei) and tuning the energy of the incident radiation. A crucial aspect of this method is the use of a low fundamental frequency of vibrations, which broadens the possibilities for $\\gamma$-ray control. The results of numerical simulations are experimentally validated by generating single and double $\\gamma$-pulses and inducing short-term absorption. For this, a resonant absorber containing $^{57}$Fe nuclei was vibrated with different motion profiles composed of 12 harmonics with a fundamental frequency of 1\\,MHz. The proposed technique represents an advancement in the manipulation of $\\gamma$-rays and potentially X-rays, paving the way for the performance of unique types of $\\gamma$-ray or X-ray quantum experiments and the development of tools such as adjustable tabletop $\\gamma$-pulse sources or $\\gamma$-ray or X-ray delays and gates. Moreover, inverse application of the method enables investigation of motion at the picometer scale.         ",

    "abstract": "           We simultaneously cool $\\gtrsim$100 mechanical modes of a membrane with a photothermally modified optical cavity driven by a single blue-detuned laser. In contrast to radiation pressure and bolometric forces applied directly to the mechanical system, this cooling effect does not depend on the sign of detuning, allowing for single-laser stabilization (i.e., simultaneous positive optical spring and damping) that is especially effective at room temperature and high laser power. We also provide intuition about the competing thermal processes, and propose two simple modifications to the mirror coatings that can strongly enhance this effect.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum non-Gaussian states of photons and phonons are conclusive and direct witnesses of higher-than-quadratic nonlinearities in optical and mechanical processes. Moreover, they are proven resources for quantum sensing, communication and error correction with diverse continuous-variable systems. This review introduces theoretical analyses of nonclassical and quantum non-Gaussian states of photons and phonons. It recapitulates approaches used to derive operational criteria for photons tolerant to optical losses, their application in experiments and their nowadays extension to quantum non-Gaussian photon coincidences. It extends to a recent comparison of quantum non-Gaussianity, including robustness to thermal noise, and sensing capability for high-quality phononic Fock states of single trapped cooled ions. The review can stimulate further development in the criteria of quantum non-Gaussian states and experimental effort to prepare and detect such useful features, navigating the community to advanced quantum physics and technology.

    "title": "Sub-wavelength optical lattice in 2D materials",
    "abstract": "           Recently, light-matter interaction has been vastly expanded as a control tool for inducing and enhancing many emergent non-equilibrium phenomena. However, conventional schemes for exploring such light-induced phenomena rely on uniform and diffraction-limited free-space optics, which limits the spatial resolution and the efficiency of light-matter interaction. Here, we overcome these challenges using metasurface plasmon polaritons (MPPs) to form a sub-wavelength optical lattice. Specifically, we report a ``non-local\" pump-probe scheme where MPPs are excited to induce a spatially modulated AC Stark shift for excitons in a monolayer of MoSe$_2$, several microns away from the illumination spot. Remarkably, we identify nearly two orders of magnitude reduction for the required modulation power compared to the free-space optical illumination counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate a broadening of the excitons' linewidth as a robust signature of MPP-induced periodic sub-diffraction modulation. Our results will allow exploring power-efficient light-induced lattice phenomena below the diffraction limit in active chip-compatible MPP architectures.         ",
