    "abstract": "           This essay gives a short, informal account of the development of digital logic from the Pleistocene to the Manhattan Project, the introduction of reversible circuits, and Richard Feynman's allied proposal for quantum computing. We argue that Feynman's state-based analogy is not the only way to arrive at quantum computing, nor indeed the simplest. To illustrate, we imagine an alternate timeline in which John von Neumann skipped Operation Crossroads to debug a military computer, got tickled by the problem, and discovered a completely different picture of quantum computing - in 1946. Feynman suggested we \"quantize\" state, and turn classically reversible circuits into quantum reversible, unitary ones. In contrast, we speculate that von Neumann, with his background in functional analysis and quantum logic, would seek to \"quantize\" the operators of Boolean algebra, and with tools made available in 1946 could successfully do so. This leads to a simpler, more flexible circuit calculus and beautiful parallels to classical logic, as we detail in a forthcoming companion paper.         ",

    "abstract": "           The transition towards designs which co-package electronic and photonic die together in data center switch packages has created a scaling path to Petabyte per second (Pbps) input/output (I/O) in such systems. In a co-packaged design, the scaling of bandwidth, cost, and energy will be governed by the number of optical I/O channels and the data rate per channel. While optical communication provide an opportunity to exploit wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to scale data rate, the limited 127 $\\mu$m pitch of V-groove based single mode fiber arrays and the use of active alignment and bonding for their packaging present challenges to scaling the number of optical channels. Flip-chip optical couplers which allow for low loss, broadband operation and automated passive assembly represent a solution for continued scaling. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to vertically couple between silicon based waveguides on separate chips using graded index (GRIN) couplers in combination with an evanescent coupler. Simulation results using a 3D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) solver are presented, demonstrating coupling losses below 0.27 dB for a chip-to-chip gap of 11 $\\mu$m; 1-dB vertical and lateral alignment tolerances of approximately 2.38 $\\mu$m and $\\pm$ 2.24 $\\mu$m, respectively; and a greater than 360 nm 1-dB bandwidth. These results demonstrate the potential of our coupler as a universal interface in future co-packaged optics systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Accurate and efficient theoretical descriptions of lanthanide systems based on ab initio electronic structure theory remain highly challenging due to the complex interplay of strong electronic correlation and significant relativistic effects in 4f electrons. The composite multi-configurational quantum chemistry method, which combines the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) approach with subsequent state interaction (SI) treatment of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), abbreviated as CASSI-SO, has emerged as the preferred method for ab initio studies of lanthanide systems. However, its widespread application is hindered by its substantial computational cost. Building on the success of integrating density-matrix embedding theory (DMET) with CASSI-SO in our previous theoretical study of 3d single-ion magnets (SIMs) (Ai, Sun, and Jiang, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2022, 13, 10627), we now extend the DMET+CASSI-SO approach to lanthanide SIM systems. We provide a detailed formulation of the regularized direct inversion of iterative subspace (R-DIIS) algorithm, which ensures obtaining physically correct restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) wavefunctions, a critical factor for the effectiveness of DMET. Additionally, we introduce the subspace R-DIIS (sR-DIIS) algorithm, which proves to be more efficient and robust for lanthanide systems. Using several representative lanthanide single-ion magnets (4f-SIMs) as test cases, we demonstrate the performance of these new algorithms and highlight the exceptional accuracy of the DMET+CASSI-SO approach. We anticipate that this enhanced DMET+CASSI-SO methodology will significantly advance large-scale theoretical investigations of complex lanthanide systems.         ",

This approach achieves sub-meter spatial resolution directly from a single long pulse experimental data through self-supervised learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a physical model has been used to enhance neural network models in the field of optical fiber sensing. Simulation results show that the BGS distribution reconstructed by this technique has a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.02 compared to the ideal BGSs. And the standard deviation of the extracted BFS is 0.65 MHz. Experimental results indicate that, for a 40 ns pulse BGS distribution, the proposed approach accurately reconstructs a BGS distribution with 0.5 m spatial resolution. The proposed technique demonstrates a significant advantage over results from the deconvolution algorithm and supervised learning methods.         ",

The performance can be further improved using integrated photonic-phononic devices, promising enhanced interaction strength and large-scale integration. While the enhanced interaction has been widely demonstrated, it is challenging to realize large-scale integrated photonic-phononic circuits due to material limitations. Here, we resolve this critical issue by using gallium nitride on sapphire for scalable photonicphononic integrated circuits. Both optical and acoustic fields are confined in sub-wavelength scales without suspended structures. This enables us to achieve the efficient launching, flexible routing, and reconfigruable processing of optical and acoustic fields simultaneously. With the controlled photonic-phononic interaction and strong piezoelectric effect, we further demonstrate the reconfigurable conversion between frequency-multiplexed RF and optical signals mediated by acoustics. This work provides an ideal platform for achieving ultimate performance of photonic-phononic hybrid systems with high efficiency, multiple functions, and large scalability.         ",

For standard optical cavities, each eigenmode corresponds to a single, well-defined frequency. Here, we present a macroscopic optical Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity whose eigenmodes are coherent superpositions of two frequency modes in the VIS-NIR range. Specifically, we demonstrate strong coupling between 384 THz (780 nm) and 580 THz (516 nm) cavity modes by incorporating an intracavity $\\chi^{(2)}$ crystal driven by a non-resonant optical pump at 1529 nm. Strong coupling enables us to demonstrate frequency conversion with an end-to-end, free-space conversion efficiency of 30(1)%, limited by current cavity design and internal cavity losses. We also demonstrate coupling between distinct spatial modes at the two frequencies, extending coherent control to the spatial basis. In conjunction with improved resonator design and low-loss nonlinear crystals, we anticipate a factor of $>$50 increase in two-mode-cooperativity for stronger coupling and near-unity conversion efficiency at low pump powers. This platform opens new avenues for cavity-QED experiments, with potential applications spanning cavity-mediated interactions between distinct atomic species, interconnects for quantum networking and modular computing, and spatially multimode cavity physics.

Sensor geometry was optimized using Method-of-Moments simulation before the sensor was fabricated and validated on standard solutions of glucose concentrations between 0 to 126 mg/dL within the physiological range, and a human test subject.

The key of this technique is to apply hybrid amplitude and phase modulation to the incident light, which significantly enhances the control capability over the output optical spectrum. This enhanced control turns to be crucial for the efficient generation of THz waves. By carefully adjusting the relative phase offset between microwave RF signals applied to the amplitude and phase modulators and by applying an appropriate DC bias to the amplitude modulator, we can considerably reduce the optical power of unwanted sidebands. This allows us to concentrate more energy on desired frequencies, facilitating the generation of high-purity THz waves through optical heterodyne mixing at the detector. To validate our concept, we have successfully generated a dual-frequency-like laser with as spectral separation of 0.897 THz. This result was accomplished by modulating the phase EOM at 34.5 GHz with a modulation depth of ~4.7, paving the way for the generation of more practical and efficient THz waves.         ",

While unstable LRs are relevant for the observation of black hole images, stable LRs have been suspected to trigger instabilities, namely in exotic compact objects that could mimic black holes. The underlying mechanism behind this instability remains poorly understood, but a key missing piece is how the backreaction of a perturbation around the stable LR modifies the surrounding spacetime. In this work, some progress in this direction is provided by examining a conceptually simple, yet instructive, toy model: continuum-shell stars, supported solely by tangential pressures. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we show how perturbations around the stable LR deepen the geodesic potential and shifts its location inward, potentially amplifying any instability associated with the LR. By then extending the analysis to more general stars with nonzero radial pressure, we find that the same phenomenon can be expected to persist under reasonable assumptions.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum illumination leverages entanglement to surpass classical target detection, even in high-noise environments. Remarkably, its quantum advantage persists despite entanglement degradation caused by environmental decoherence. A central challenge lies in designing optimal receivers to exploit this advantage, with the correlation-to-displacement conversion module emerging as a promising candidate. However, the practical implementation of the conversion module faces technical hurdles, primarily due to the vast number of modes involved. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a frequency-mode entangled source with matched photon numbers, a heterodyne detection scheme for the returned signals across vast modes, and a cavity-enhanced quantum pulse gate for programmable mode processing. This integrated framework paves the way for the realization of practical quantum illumination systems.         ",

HPL systems are instrumental in high-energy physics, leveraging ultra-short impulse durations to yield extremely high intensities, which are essential for both practical applications and theoretical advancements in light-matter interactions. Traditionally, the parameters regulating HPL optical performance are tuned manually by human experts, or optimized by using black-box methods that can be computationally demanding. Critically, black box methods rely on stationarity assumptions overlooking complex dynamics in high-energy physics and day-to-day changes in real-world experimental settings, and thus need to be often restarted. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by enabling sequential decision making in non-static settings. This work investigates the safe application of DRL to HPL systems, and extends the current research by (1) learning a control policy directly from images and (2) addressing the need for generalization across diverse dynamics. We evaluate our method across various configurations and observe that DRL effectively enables cross-domain adaptability, coping with dynamics' fluctuations while achieving 90% of the target intensity in test environments.

    "abstract": "           Photonic technologies continue to drive the quest for new optical materials with unprecedented responses. A major frontier in this field is the exploration of nonlocal (spatially dispersive) materials, going beyond the local, wavevector-independent assumption traditionally made in optical material modeling. On one end, the growing interest in plasmonic, polaritonic and quantum materials has revealed naturally occurring nonlocalities, emphasizing the need for more accurate models to predict and design their optical responses. This has major implications also for topological, nonreciprocal, and time-varying systems based on these material platforms. Beyond natural materials, artificially structured materials--metamaterials and metasurfaces--can provide even stronger and engineered nonlocal effects, emerging from long-range interactions or multipolar effects. This is a rapidly expanding area in the field of photonic metamaterials, with open frontiers yet to be explored. In the case of metasurfaces, in particular, nonlocality engineering has become a powerful tool for designing strongly wavevector-dependent responses, enabling enhanced wavefront control, spatial compression, multifunctional devices, and wave-based computing. Furthermore, nonlocality and related concepts play a critical role in defining the ultimate limits of what is possible in optics, photonics, and wave physics. This Roadmap aims to survey the most exciting developments in nonlocal photonic materials, highlight new opportunities and open challenges, and chart new pathways that will drive this emerging field forward--toward new scientific discoveries and technological advancements.

Silicon photomultipliers are increasingly used for detecting near-UV, optical, and infrared light in space due to their compact design, low cost, low power consumption, robustness, and high photo-detection efficiency, which makes them sensitive to single photons. Although SiPMs outperform traditional photomultiplier tubes in many areas, concerns about their radiation tolerance and noise remain. In this study, we estimate the radiation effects on a satellite in sun-synchronous low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 550~km during the declining phase of solar cycle 25 (2026-2029). We evaluated silicon photomultipliers produced by the Foundation Bruno Kessler (FBK) using front-side illuminated technology with metal trenches (NUV-HD-MT), assessing their response to a 50~MeV proton beam and exposure to a $\\beta$-radioactive source (strontium-90). Simulations with SPENVIS and Geant4 were used to validate the experimental results. Based on our findings, we propose a photosensor annealing strategy for space-based instruments.         ",

    "abstract": "           Microwave cavities used in axion haloscope experiments typically employ a tuning rod as a means to widen the range of resonance frequencies at which it is sensitive to axion-to-photon conversion. A realistic tuning mechanism requires a gap between the cavity end caps and the tuning rod to ensure movement, and causes some modes to hybridize with the resonant mode that is being tracked for the experiment. These so-called mode mixings lead to gaps in the frequency range that practically lose sensitivity to axions. In order to solve this problem, we present a cavity design which, for two tuning rod configurations corresponding to a lower and higher frequency range, have a dielectric rod inserted at a specific location that makes the cavity asymmetrical. Moving the tuning rod closer to the dielectric insert changes the location and frequency of the mode mixing compared to when it is farther away from it. This design makes possible an axion dark matter search with minimal loss in sensitivity due to mode mixings. We also show that the same design has the same desired effect when cavity dimensions are scaled down to be smaller and are at higher resonance frequencies.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum memories based on emitters with optically addressable spins rely on efficient photonic interfaces, often implemented as nanophotonic cavities with ideally narrow spectral linewidths and small mode volumes. However, these approaches require nearly perfect spectral and spatial overlap between the cavity mode and quantum emitter, which can be challenging. This is especially true in the case of solid-state quantum emitters that are often randomly positioned and can suffer from significant inhomogeneous broadening. An alternative approach to mitigate these challenges is to use slow-light waveguides that can enhance light-matter interaction across large optical bandwidths and large areas. Here, we demonstrate diamond slow light photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides that enable broadband optical coupling to embedded silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers. We take advantage of the recently demonstrated thin-film diamond photonic platform to fabricate fully suspended two-dimensional PhC waveguides. Using this approach, we demonstrate waveguide modes with high group indices up to 70 and observe Purcell-enhanced emissions of the SiVs coupled to the waveguide mode. Our approach represents a practical diamond platform for robust spin-photon interfaces with color centers.         ",

This paper proposes a phase space representation as generic interpretation of surfaces to enhance tribological assessments. By deriving distinctions between two-dimensional and three-dimensional manifolds from phenomenological thermodynamics, we demonstrate the existence of fractal dimensions on physical surfaces. Utilizing the smallest representable wavelength, a coordinate ensemble where each coordinate has a generalized degree of freedom and a differential amount across fractal dimensions is proposed. The metric is interpreted as a time coordinate, allowing the derivative to be seen as velocity. Through geometric dimension analysis, we derive a topographic Hamiltonian via generalized momentum. Each coordinate pair in the ensemble is assigned a location in phase space. Statistical considerations define a symplectic structure and phase space volume. As a use-case, a two-disc experiment demonstrates that topography changes under load can be understood as a self-organization process through thermodynamic reasoning. As a possibility for a direct assessment of the phase space of a surface for monitoring tribological processes, we propose the combination of topographic measuring systems with scattering light measurement. This multi sensor approach offers opportunities for optimizing performance in tribological applications.         ",

Photoluminescence measurements at low temperature (15 K) support that Eu$^{2+}$ replaces three crystallographically independent Na$^+$ sites in Na$_{2.97}$Eu$_{0.015}$AlP$_3$O$_9$N, similar to the parent K$^+$ phosphor, but substituting Ga$^{3+}$ and In$^{3+}$ for Al$^{3+}$ leads to a change in Eu$^{2+}$ site preference, narrowing the full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) of the emission peak. The chromatic stability and photoluminescence quantum yield are also enhanced with higher Ga$^{3+}$ content in the host but not with In$^{3+}$. Thermoluminescence analysis indicates the relationship between trap states and the enhanced quantum yield with Ga$^{3+}$ leads to the series' best performance.

Double-folded rings fall into different dynamical universality classes depending on whether the random tree-like graphs underlying the double-folding are quenched or annealed, and whether the trees can undergo unhindered Brownian motion in their spatial embedding. Locally, one can distinguish (i) repton-like mass transport around a fixed tree, (ii) the spontaneous creation and deletion of side branches, and (iii) displacements of tree node, where complementary ring segments diffuse together in space. Here we employ dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a suitable elastic lattice polymer model of double-folded, randomly branching ring polymers to explore the mesoscopic dynamics that emerge from different combinations of the above local modes in three different systems: ideal non-interacting rings, self-avoiding rings, and rings in the melt state. We observe the expected scaling regimes for ring reptation, the dynamics of double-folded rings in an array of obstacles, and Rouse-like tree dynamics as limiting cases. Of particular interest, the monomer mean-square displacements of $g_1\\sim t^{0.4}$ observed for crumpled rings with $\\nu=1/3$ are similar to the subdiffusive regime observed in bacterial chromosomes. In our analysis, we focus on the question to which extent contributions of different local dynamical modes to the emergent dynamics are simply additive. Notably, we reveal a non-trivial acceleration of the dynamics of interacting rings, when all three types of local motion are present.         ",

This study is conducted through a comparison of gyrofluid and gyrokinetic simulations. The comparison shows in general a good capability of the gyrofluid models in predicting the plasmoid instability observed with gyrokinetic simulations.

Evidently, the evolution towards the active control of such structural colours with smart materials is in progress for real applications. Here we experimentally demonstrate a large colour gamut with high intensity and purity, as well as its switching on and off based solely on tungsten trioxide (WO3) cylindrical resonators. The strong resonances in the visible spectral range in these WO3 metasurfaces can be reversibly switched on and off due to its electrochromism by applying alternating voltages of +2.0 V and -0.3 V. Our approach opens up possibilities for the functional diversification of commercial smart windows, as well as the development of new display technologies in the future.         ",

    "abstract": "           Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.

    "abstract": "           Quantum computing shows great potential, but errors pose a significant challenge. This study explores new strategies for mitigating quantum errors using artificial neural networks (ANN) and the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE). Unlike traditional error mitigation methods, which are computationally intensive, we investigate artificial error mitigation. We developed a novel method that combines ANN for noise mitigation combined with the YBE to generate noisy data. This approach effectively reduces noise in quantum simulations, enhancing the accuracy of the results. The YBE rigorously preserves quantum correlations and symmetries in spin chain simulations in certain classes of integrable lattice models, enabling effective compression of quantum circuits while retaining linear scalability with the number of qubits. This compression facilitates both full and partial implementations, allowing the generation of noisy quantum data on hardware alongside noiseless simulations using classical platforms. By introducing controlled noise through the YBE, we enhance the dataset for error mitigation. We train an ANN model on partial data from quantum simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating errors in time-evolving quantum states, providing a scalable framework to enhance quantum computation fidelity, particularly in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by performing quantum time dynamics simulations using the Heisenberg XY Hamiltonian on real quantum devices.         ",

    "abstract": "           We propose a novel algorithm for calculating the ground-state energy of quantum many-body systems by combining auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) with tensor-train sketching. In AFQMC, having a good trial wavefunction to guide the random walk is crucial for avoiding sign problems. Typically, this trial wavefunction is fixed throughout the simulation. Our proposed method iterates between determining a new trial wavefunction in the form of a tensor train, derived from the current walkers, and using this updated trial wavefunction to anchor the next phase of AFQMC. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm is highly accurate for large spin systems, achieving a relative error of \\(10^{-5}\\) in estimating ground-state energies. Additionally, the overlap between our estimated trial wavefunction and the ground-state wavefunction achieves a high-fidelity. Our algorithm exhibits advantages over density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We also provide a convergence proof, highlighting how an effective trial wavefunction can reduce the variance in the AFQMC energy estimation.         ",

    "abstract": "           Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin and simultaneously possess spin-resolved optical transitions, making them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface. These interfaces are an important building block of quantum networks, which in turn promise to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing. To achieve this goal, the rate of coherently scattered photons collected from a single emitter needs to be maximized, which can be achieved by interfacing the emitter with an optical cavity. In this work, we integrate V2 centers inside a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-P\u00e9rot microcavity. We find that SiC lends itself well to membrane fabrication, as evidenced by low surface roughness $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{RMS}}$ ~ 400 pm, high reproducibility, and consequentially a high cavity finesse F ~ 40 000. At cryogenic temperatures, we observe individual emitters coupling to cavity modes. We confirm their single-emitter character by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function and investigate the Purcell factor by measuring the optical lifetime as a function of the cavity-emitter detuning. We find a 13.3-fold enhancement of photons scattered into the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which could be further increased by using optimized mirror coatings, potentially opening the path towards deterministic spin-photon interaction.

    "abstract": "           Reservoir computing (RC) is an innovative paradigm in neuromorphic computing that leverages fixed, randomized, internal connections to address the challenge of overfitting. RC has shown remarkable effectiveness in signal processing and pattern recognition tasks, making it well-suited for hardware implementations across various physical substrates, which promise enhanced computation speeds and reduced energy consumption. However, achieving optimal performance in RC systems requires effective parameter optimization. Traditionally, this optimization has relied on software modeling, limiting the practicality of physical computing approaches. Here, we report an \\emph{in situ} optimization method for an optoelectronic delay-based RC system with digital delayed feedback. By simultaneously optimizing five parameters, normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of 0.028, 0.561, and 0.271 is achieved in three benchmark tasks: waveform classification, time series prediction, and speech recognition outperforming simulation-based optimization (NMSE 0.054, 0.543, and 0.329, respectively) in the two of the three tasks. This method marks a significant advancement in physical computing, facilitating the optimization of RC and neuromorphic systems without the need for simulation, thus enhancing their practical applicability.

    "title": "Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves",
    "abstract": "           Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.         ",
