    "abstract": "           CERN's strategic R&D programme on technologies for future experiments recently started investigating the TPSCo 65nm ISC CMOS imaging process for monolithic active pixels sensors for application in high energy physics. In collaboration with the ALICE experiment and other institutes, several prototypes demonstrated excellent performance, qualifying the technology. The Hybrid-to-Monolithic (H2M), a new test-chip produced in the same process but with a larger pixel pitch than previous prototypes, exhibits an unexpected asymmetric efficiency pattern. This contribution describes a simulation procedure combining TCAD, Monte Carlo and circuit simulations to model and understand this effect. It proved able to reproduce measurement results and attribute the asymmetric efficiency drop to a slow charge collection due to low amplitude potential wells created by the circuitry layout and impacting efficiency via ballistic deficit.

    "abstract": "           Obtaining a group velocity higher than the speed of sound in a waveguide is a challenging task in acoustic wave engineering. Even more challenging is to achieve this velocity increase without any intervention with the waveguide profile, such as narrowing or widening, and particularly without interfering with the passage by flexible inclusions, either passive or active. Here, we approach this problem by invoking concepts from non- Hermitian physics, and imposing them using active elements that are smoothly sealed within the waveguide wall. In a real-time feedback operation, the elements induce local pressure gain and loss, as well as non-local pressure integration couplings. We employ a dedicated balancing between the control parameters, derived from lattice theory and adjusted to the waveguide system, to drive the dynamics into a stable parity-time-symmetric regime. We demonstrate the accelerated propagation of a wave packet both numerically and experimentally in an air-filled waveguide and discuss the trade-off between stabilization and the achievable velocity increase. Our work prepares the grounds for advanced forms of wave transmission in continuous media, enabled by short and long range active couplings, created via embedded real-time feedback control.

    "abstract": "           The terahertz frequency band, ranging from 0.1 to 10 THz, offers extensive spectral resources for next-generation wireless communication systems. To compensate for the limited transmission power of terahertz transceivers and the significant propagation losses in terahertz channels, high-gain directional antennas are essential. Dynamic beam manipulation is therefore crucial for enabling practical communication applications. Moreover, the stringent gain requirements in terahertz systems result in an expanded Fresnel region, highlighting the critical need for efficient beam manipulation techniques in both near-field and far-field conditions. This article provides a comprehensive overview of terahertz beam manipulation techniques. It begins with an introduction of diffraction theory as the foundational propagation model for beam manipulation. Detailed examples tailored to specific communication scenarios are then presented. Experimental verifications using 3-D printed lenses are included for three distinct beam manipulation cases. Alternative approaches for achieving beam manipulation, such as metasurfaces and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, are briefly discussed.         ",

The key component is a novel multi-port beam-splitting (PD-MPBS) metasurface that relies on both propagation phase and geometric phase. The fabricated samples exhibit high beam-splitting power uniformity (within 4.4%) and polarization purities (91.29%~93.15%). By leveraging such beam-splitting device as well as reflective beam-expanding meta-device, an integrated six-beam delivery system for miniaturized MOT application has been implemented. The experimental results indicate that six expanded beams have been successfully delivered with uniform power (within 9.5%), the desired CP configuration and large overlapping volume (76.2 mm^3). We believe that a miniaturized MOT with the proposed beam delivery system is very promising for portable application of cold atom technology in precision measurement, atomic clock, quantum simulation and computing, etc.         ",

    "abstract": "           The nonreciprocal magnetoelectric effect in isotropic Tellegen materials enables exotic phenomena such as axion-modified electrodynamics and fosters the development of magnet-free nonreciprocal media. Although predicted over 75 years ago and observed in only a handful of natural materials with very low strength, the strong optical Tellegen effect has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of a resonant optical isotropic Tellegen effect in a metasurface, showcasing a response that is 100 times greater than that of any known natural material. This optical metasurface, consisting of randomly distributed cobalt-silicon nanoscatterers with strong shape anisotropy, utilizes spontaneous magnetization to achieve a robust Tellegen effect without the need for an external magnetic field. In addition to the Tellegen response, the metasurface exhibits both gyroelectric and gyromagnetic effects, contributing to nonreciprocal cross-polarized light reflection. We introduce a technique to independently extract the amplitudes of these three effects using conventional magneto-optical single-side illumination measurements. The observation of the resonant Tellegen effects in the optical frequency range may lead to the experimental observation of axionic electrodynamics and compact bias-free nonreciprocal optical devices.

The design of VPCs is typically based on analogies with condensed-matter topological insulators that exhibit the quantum valley Hall effect; trial-and-error approaches are often used to tailor the photonic band structures and their topological properties, which are characterized by the local Berry curvatures. In this paper, we present an inverse design framework based on frequency-domain analysis for VPCs with arbitrary pseudospin states. Specifically, we utilize the transverse spin angular momentum (TSAM) at the band edge to formulate the objective function for engineering the desired topological properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed design approach can successfully produce photonic crystal waveguides exhibiting dual-band operation, enabling frequency-dependent light routing. Our pseudospin-engineering method thus provides a cost-effective alternative for designing topological photonic waveguides, offering novel functionalities.         ",

    "abstract": "           We report a Mueller matrix ellipsometer design using dual continuously rotating anisotropic meta wave plates which determines the full set of Mueller matrix elements in the terahertz spectral range. The instrument operates in the frequency domain and employs a frequency tunable, solid state synthesizer based, continuous wave terahertz source with sub-MHz bandwidth. The implemented source permits operation within 82-125 GHz and 170-250 GHz, without and with an additional frequency doubler, respectively. The terahertz transparent meta wave plates consist of 3D-printed polymer based columnar thin film structures with subwavelength dimensions. The rotating wave plates produce sufficient modulation of the Stokes vector components of transmitted terahertz light to use the wave plates in polarization state generator and polarization state detector devices. Fast terahertz light detection rate of a quasi optical solid state detector permits acquisition with few microsecond temporal resolution and electronic sweeping control of the source frequency. We develop a fast frequency sweeping scheme while continuously rotating the terahertz wave plates. Subsequent sorting of measured data permits measurements of Mueller matrix elements at hundreds of different wavelengths. The Mueller matrix elements are obtained by forward numerical reduction of the measured data using an algorithm developed by Ruder et al.[Opt. Lett. 45, 3541 (2020)]. The instrument is combined with a magnetocryostat capable of reaching magnetic field strengths at the sample position of -8 T...8 T and sample temperatures from 4 K...400 K. Hence, the instrument is suitable to measure the full Mueller matrix of samples with magnetic resonances as demonstrated recently by Rindert et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 054413 (2024)].

Here, we demonstrate a high-fidelity mapping of skyrmion topology from a laser beam onto a gas of cold atoms, where it is detected in its new non-propagating form. Within the spatial overlap of the beam and atom cloud, the skyrmion topological charge is preserved, with a reduction from $Q \\simeq 0.91$ to $Q \\simeq 0.84$ mainly due to the beam width exceeding the sample size.

However, the narrow bandgap of silicon (1.1 eV) limits their use in short-wavelength applications, such as chemical and biological sensing, underwater optical communications, and optical atomic clocks. In this work, we developed a 3D photonics platform by heterogeneously integrating silicon nitride (SiN) and aluminum nitride (AlN) PICs on sapphire (Al$_2$O$_3$). The broadband transparency of these materials allow our platform to operate over a multi-octave wavelength ranging from ultraviolet to infrared.

Nine of the 12 levels, accounting for 126 of the 156 transitions, are studied for the first time. Branching fractions are determined for three levels studied previously for the purpose of comparison. The levels studied for the first time are high lying, ranging in energy from 36845 to 40774 cm-1. The branching fractions are determined from emission spectra from two different high-resolution spectrometers. These are combined with radiative lifetimes reported in an earlier study to produce a set of transition probabilities and log(gf) values with accuracy ranging from 5% to 30%. Comparison is made to experimental and theoretical transition probabilities from the literature where such data exist. Abundances derived from these new log(gf) values for 21 Gd II lines in two metal-poor stars yield results consistent with previous studies, and they demonstrate that the new log(gf) values can be used in stellar abundance analysis as a self-consistent extension of previous work.

We test the formulas ability to predict both DH pair production and energy increase rate. Using tensor-network-based approaches, we demonstrate that the formula provides accurate predictions in the absence of excitonic states facilitated by the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$. However, when excitonic states emerge, the formula more accurately describes the rate of energy increase than the DH pair creation rate and in both cases gets improved by incorporating the exciton energy as the effective gap.

    "title": "Triplet J-driven DNP, a proposal to increase the sensitivity of solution-state NMR without microwave",
    "abstract": "           Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is an important method to enhance the limited sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Using the existing mechanisms such as Overhauser DNP (ODNP) is still difficult to achieve significant enhancement of NMR signals in solutions at a high magnetic field. The recently proposed J-driven DNP (JDNP) condition (when the exchange interaction of two electron spins matches their Lamour frequency) may enable signal enhancement in solution as it requires only dipolar interaction between the biradical polarization agent and the analyte. However, likewise ODNP, the current JDNP strategy still requires the saturation of the electron polarization with high microwave power which has poor penetration and is associated with heating effects in most liquids. The replacement of high-power microwave irradiation is possible if the temporal electron polarization imbalance is created by a different wavelength such as the visible light. Here, we propose a triplet JDNP mechanism which first exploits the light-induced singlet fission process (i.e., a singlet exciton is converted into two triplet excitons). As the JDNP condition is fulfilled, a triplet-to-triplet cross-relaxation process will occur with different rates and consequently lead to the creation of hyperpolarization on the coupled nuclear spin states. This communication discusses the theory behind the triplet JDNP proposal, as well as the polarizing agents and conditions that will enable the new approach to enhance the sensitivity of NMR without the need of microwave irradiation.

Beginning with Planck's introduction of energy quantisation in blackbody radiation, we follow the emergence of Einstein's light quanta hypothesis, Bohr's atomic model, and the statistical implications of indistinguishable particles. Special emphasis is placed on the transition from the Old Quantum Theory to modern quantum mechanics, particularly through Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanics. This study aims to provide a structured historical account, offering insights into the conceptual transformations that led to quantum mechanics while making the development accessible to physicists, historians of science, and advanced students interested in the origins of modern quantum theory.

    "title": "Design of Macroscale Optical Systems with Metaoptics Using Transformer-Based Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "           Metaoptics are thin, planar surfaces consisting of many subwavelength optical resonators that can be designed to simultaneously control the amplitude, phase, and polarization to arbitrarily shape an optical wavefront much in the same manner as a traditional lens but with a much smaller form factor. The incorporation of metaoptics into a conventional optical system spans multiple length scales between that of the individual metaoptic elements (< {\\lambda}) and that of the entire size of the optic (>> {\\lambda}), making computational techniques that accurately simulate the optical response of metaoptics computationally intractable, while more efficient techniques utilizing various approximations suffer from inaccuracies in their prediction of the optical response. To overcome the trade between speed and accuracy, we implement a transformer-based neural network solver to calculate the optical response of metaoptics and combine it with commercial ray optics software incorporating Fourier propagation methods to simulate an entire optical system. We demonstrate that this neural net method is more than 3 orders of magnitude faster than a traditional finite-difference time domain method, with only a 0.47 % deviation in total irradiance when compared with a full wave simulation, which is nearly 2 orders of magnitude more accurate than standard approximation methods for metaoptics. The ability to accurately and efficiently predict the optical response of a metaoptic could enable their optimization, further accelerating and facilitating their application.         ",

    "abstract": "           Describing systems with non-Hermitian (NH) operators remains a challenge in quantum theory due to instabilities (e.g., exceptional points and decoherence) arising from interactions with the environment. We propose a framework to express the energy states of NH Hamiltonians using a well-defined basis (dub computational basis) derived from a related Hermitian operator. This suitably shifts the singularities from the basis states to the expansion coefficients, allowing for their easier mathematical treatment and parametric control. Furthermore, we introduce a `space-time' transformation on the computational basis that defines a generic dual space map for the energy states. Interestingly, this transformation leads to a symmetry for real/imaginary energy values, revealing the existence of weaker condition than hermiticity or the $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. This leads to clearer understanding and novel interpretations of key features like exceptional points, dual space, and weaker symmetry-enforced real eigenvalues. The applicability of our framework extends to various branches of physics where NH operators manifest as ladder operators, order parameters, self-energies, projectors, and other entities.         ",

    "abstract": "           The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments in the stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many-body systems, we have developed a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.         ",

Contrary to the generic dark soliton transverse instability, the kink structures are generically robust under the interplay of low-amplitude attractive and high-amplitude repulsive interactions. A quasi-1D effective potential picture dictates the existence of these defects, while their stability is obtained numerically and analytically through linearization analysis and direct dynamics in the presence of external fluctuations showcasing their unprecedented resilience. These generic (across different models) findings should be detectable in current cold atom and optics experiments, offering insights towards controlling topological excitations.         ",

    "abstract": "           Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin and simultaneously possess spin-resolved optical transitions, making them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface. These interfaces are an important building block of quantum networks, which in turn promise to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing. To achieve this goal, the rate of coherently scattered photons collected from a single emitter needs to be maximized, which can be achieved by interfacing the emitter with an optical cavity. In this work, we integrate V2 centers inside a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-P\u00e9rot microcavity. We find that SiC lends itself well to membrane fabrication, as evidenced by low surface roughness $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{RMS}}$ ~ 400 pm, high reproducibility, and consequentially a high cavity finesse F ~ 40 000. At cryogenic temperatures, we observe individual emitters coupling to cavity modes. We confirm their single-emitter character by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function and investigate the Purcell factor by measuring the optical lifetime as a function of the cavity-emitter detuning. We find a 13.3-fold enhancement of photons scattered into the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which could be further increased by using optimized mirror coatings, potentially opening the path towards deterministic spin-photon interaction.

    "abstract": "           Photonic technologies continue to drive the quest for new optical materials with unprecedented responses. A major frontier in this field is the exploration of nonlocal (spatially dispersive) materials, going beyond the local, wavevector-independent assumption traditionally made in optical material modeling. On one end, the growing interest in plasmonic, polaritonic and quantum materials has revealed naturally occurring nonlocalities, emphasizing the need for more accurate models to predict and design their optical responses. This has major implications also for topological, nonreciprocal, and time-varying systems based on these material platforms. Beyond natural materials, artificially structured materials--metamaterials and metasurfaces--can provide even stronger and engineered nonlocal effects, emerging from long-range interactions or multipolar effects. This is a rapidly expanding area in the field of photonic metamaterials, with open frontiers yet to be explored. In the case of metasurfaces, in particular, nonlocality engineering has become a powerful tool for designing strongly wavevector-dependent responses, enabling enhanced wavefront control, spatial compression, multifunctional devices, and wave-based computing. Furthermore, nonlocality and related concepts play a critical role in defining the ultimate limits of what is possible in optics, photonics, and wave physics. This Roadmap aims to survey the most exciting developments in nonlocal photonic materials, highlight new opportunities and open challenges, and chart new pathways that will drive this emerging field forward--toward new scientific discoveries and technological advancements.

This Hamiltonian arises from the self-energy correction of the subsystem and can be calculated exactly within our theoretical model, without the need for any approximations. Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses induced by the complex driving frequencies. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are incompatible with the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function. Our work provides a platform for studying non-Hermitian physics and their novel response in quantum systems rigorously without relying on any approximations.         ",
