    "abstract": "           The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying thousands of job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a \"human-in-the-loop\" validation process to ensure reliability, achieving an F1-score of 89%: a high level of accuracy. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships to bridge the QT workforce gap.         ",

    "abstract": "           Positioners based on near-field acoustic levitation (NFAL) offer high positioning resolution and bandwidth, primarily along the Z axis, because of the large acoustic Z-stiffness and squeeze film damping. However, their XY-positioning resolution and bandwidth are several orders of magnitude lower because of the limited acoustic stiffness and damping in these directions. In this paper, we increase the XY-stiffness and damping by using a steady-current-based planar electromagnetic trap and eddy current damping technique, respectively. Specifically, NFAL is used to levitate a magnetic platform, which is then electromagnetically trapped in the XY-plane. Eddy currents generated by a thin copper plate beneath the levitating platform increase in-plane damping by a factor of 52, thereby reducing vibrations inherent in the NFAL technique. Additionally, the planar coil used for electromagnetic trapping provides multi-axis positioning capabilities. We demonstrate 3-axis linear motion with a root mean square (rms) positioning resolution of better than 20 nm along all axes. The in-plane motion range and bandwidth achieved are 1.42 mm and 16 Hz, respectively, while a motion range of 40 micrometers with a positioning bandwidth of 171 Hz is achieved along the Z-axis.

    "abstract": "           The reentry of the OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule (SRC) on September 24, 2023, presented a rare opportunity to study atmospheric entry dynamics through a dense network of ground-based infrasound sensors. As the first interplanetary capsule to reenter over the United States since Stardust in 2006, this event allowed for unprecedented observations of infrasound signals generated during hypersonic descent. We deployed 39 single-sensor stations across Nevada and Utah, strategically distributed to capture signals from distinct trajectory points. Infrasound data were analyzed to examine how signal amplitude and period vary with altitude and propagation path for a non-ablating hypersonic object with well-defined physical and aerodynamic properties. Raytracing simulations incorporated atmospheric specifications from the Ground-2-Space model to estimate source altitudes for observed signals. Results confirmed ballistic arrivals at all stations, with source altitudes ranging from 44 km to 62 km along the trajectory. Signal period and amplitude exhibited strong dependence on source altitude, with higher altitudes corresponding to lower amplitudes, longer periods, and reduced high-frequency content. Regression analysis demonstrated strong correlations between signal characteristics and both altitude and propagation geometry. Our results suggest, when attenuation is considered, the amplitude is primarily determined by the source, with the propagation path playing a secondary role over the distances examined. These findings emphasize the utility of controlled SRC reentries for advancing our understanding of natural meteoroid dynamics, refining atmospheric entry models, and improving methodologies for planetary defense.

By utilizing cross-coupled micro-ring resonators and differential photodiode structures, along with optical waveguides instead of traditional wordlines and bitlines, our pSRAM exhibits high-speed, and energy-efficient performance. The pSRAM bitcell demonstrates a read/write speed of 40 GHz, with a switching (static) energy consumption of approximately 0.6 pJ (0.03 pJ) per bit and a footprint of 330x290 um^2 using the GlobalFoundries 45SPCLO process node.

Due to the inherent inhomogeneity of the FPC thickness, the resonance of the cavity can exhibit a spatial distribution, requiring dynamic adjustment of the interrogation wavelength when raster-scanning the sensor with a probe beam. To avoid this, we propose in this work the use of an electro-optically modulated dual-comb light source for rapid acoustic wave sensing within a specified bandwidth. Utilizing a dual-comb vibrometry approach, we demonstrated a proof-of-principle of the technique, with real-time detection of 10 MHz acoustic waves simultaneously with three different teeth (separated by 10 GHz) of the dual-frequency comb, achieving a 20 ns temporal resolution. We also investigated the system's sensitivity limit in terms of the strength of the detected acoustic waves, opening new possibilities for ultrafast PA imaging modalities.         ",

Here we introduce a novel method for the geometrically transferable optimization of neural network wave functions that leverages weight sharing and dynamical ordering of electronic states. Our method enables the efficient prediction of ground and excited-state PESs and their intersections at the highest accuracy, demonstrating up to two orders of magnitude cost reduction compared to single-point calculations. We validate our approach on three challenging excited-state PESs, including ethylene, the carbon dimer, and the methylenimmonium cation, indicating that transferable deep-learning QMC can pave the way towards highly accurate simulation of excited-state dynamics.

Mitigating these impairments is typically done using complex digital signal processing algorithms. However, these equalisation methods require significant power consumption and introduce high latencies. Photonic reservoir computing (a subfield of neural networks) offers an alternative solution, processing signals in the analog optical Domain. In this work, we present to our knowledge the very first experimental demonstration of real-time online equalisation of fibre distortions using a silicon photonics chip that combines the recurrent reservoir and the programmable readout layer. We successfully equalize a 28 Gbps on-off keying signal across varying power levels and fibre lengths, even in the highly nonlinear regime. We obtain bit error rates orders of magnitude below previously reported optical equalisation methods, reaching as low as 4e-7 , far below the generic forward error correction limit of 5.8e-5 used in commercial Ethernet interfaces. Also, simulations show that simply by removing delay lines, the system becomes compatible with line rates of 896 Gpbs. Using wavelength multiplexing, this can result in a throughput in excess of 89.6 Tbps. Finally, incorporating non-volatile phase shifters, the power consumption can be less than 6 fJ/bit.         ",

This distinctive optical structure is modeled using the optical metric of the static BTZ black hole, corresponding to the hyperbolic wormhole framework. Within this model, we derive the arbitrary geodesics and the associated effective potential. Our analysis reveals that the effective potential becomes increasingly narrow as the curvature radius of the optical wormhole decreases, with all possible trajectories converging at the optical origin \\(\\rho = 0\\). We further analyze the wave modes governing light propagation on this curved surface, demonstrating that the effective potential is purely repulsive in both the small and large \\(\\rho\\) limits. While the potential remains finite in both regimes, its behavior differs markedly. Near the optical origin, the magnetic quantum number (\\(m\\)) exerts a significant influence on the effective repulsive potential, particularly for large values of \\(m\\), where the potential resembles a typical barrier. However, this effect diminishes with increasing optical distance. Using this framework, we compute the reflection and transmission coefficients for \\(m \\neq 0\\).

This assessment is made on the basis of training data generation cost associated with each model and is compared with the single fidelity kernel ridge regression (KRR) case. The results indicate that the use of multifidelity methods surpasses the standard $\\Delta$-ML approaches in cases of a large number of predictions. For applications which require only a few evaluations to be made using ML models, while the $\\Delta$-ML method might be favored, the MF$\\Delta$ML method is shown to be more efficient.         ",

    "abstract": "           Forward proton spectrometers at high-energy proton colliders rely on precision timing to discriminate signal from background. Silicon low gain avalanche diodes (LGADs) are a candidate for future timing detectors in these systems. A major challenge for the use of LGADs is that these detectors must be placed within a few mm of the beams, resulting in a very large and highly non-uniform radiation environment. We present a first measurement of the current and capacitance vs. voltage behavior of LGAD sensors, after a highly non-uniform irradiation with beams of 24 GeV/c protons at fluences up to $1\\times10^{16} p/cm^{2}$.

In this work, we derive an analytical model for efficiently evaluating the motion-induced infidelity in remote entanglement generation protocols. Our model is applicable for various photonic qubit encodings such as polarization, time bin, and frequency, and with arbitrary initial motional states, thus providing a crucial theoretical tool for realizing high-fidelity quantum networking. For the case of tweezer-trapped neutral atoms, our results indicate that operating in the bad-cavity regime with cavity decay rate exceeding atom-photon coupling rate, and near-ground-state cooling with motional quanta below 1, are desired to suppress the motion-induced infidelity sufficiently below the 1% level required for efficient quantum networking. Finite temperature effects can be mitigated efficiently by detection time filtering at the moderate cost of success probability and network speed. These results extend the understanding of infidelity sources in remote entanglement generation protocols, establishing a concrete path towards fault-tolerant quantum networking with scalable trapped-atom qubit systems.

Theoretical predictions are obtained by an approximate model for direct TPDI and atomic structure calculations, which are implemented into a Monte Carlo simulation. The prevailing mechanism includes the excitation and prompt photoionization of an autoionizing resonance in neutral argon.

    "abstract": "           Among present quantum many-body computational methods, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is one of the most promising approaches for dealing with large-scale complex systems. It has played an extremely important role in understanding quantum many-body physics. However, two dark clouds, namely the sign problem and general measurement issues, have seriously hampered its scope of application. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\\langle \\mathrm{O} \\rangle=\\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\\bar{Z}=\\mathrm{tr} (\\mathrm{Oe^{-\\beta H}})$ and $Z=\\mathrm{tr} (\\mathrm{e^{-\\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and time. Essentially, this scheme solves the long-standing problem of calculating the overlap between different distribution functions in mathematical statistics, which can be widely used in statistical problems, such as quantum many-body computation, big data and machine learning.

It is shown that the effects of quantum fluctuations become visible once the quantum length scale (Fermi wavelength) of the quasiparticles becomes comparable to the lengthscale of the external potential. Under such conditions, quantum fluctuations are mostly felt on the odd kinetic moments, while the even ones remain nearly unaffected because they are \"protected\" by thermal fluctuations.

This Hamiltonian arises from the self-energy correction of the subsystem and can be calculated exactly within our theoretical model, without the need for any approximations. Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses induced by the complex driving frequencies. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are incompatible with the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function. Our work provides a platform for studying non-Hermitian physics and their novel response in quantum systems rigorously without relying on any approximations.         ",

Building upon direct observations through hybrid quantum-classical learning, we discover two new 4-qubit amplitude damping codes with an innovative noise-strength-adaptive (NSA) feature where the codeword varies with noise strength. They are NSA self-complementary and NSA pair-complementary codes. We show that they can both outperform conventional codes for amplitude damping (AD) noise. The 4-qubit self-complementary NSA code outperforms the standard LNCY AD code in fidelity and Knill-Laflamme condition violation. The pair-complementary code, which has no known non-NSA analog, achieves even better performance with higher-order loss suppression and better fidelity. We further generalize both approaches to families of NSA AD codes for arbitrary system size, as well as an NSA variant of the 0-2-4 binomial code for single-photon loss. Our results demonstrate that adaptation to noise strength can systematically lead to significant improvements in error correction capability, and also showcase how machine learning can help discover new valuable code formalisms that may not emerge from traditional design approaches.
