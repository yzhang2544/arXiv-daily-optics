    "title": "Challenges in Scaling ScAlN Bulk Acoustic Wave Filters toward Ku-Band Frequencies",
    "abstract": "           This paper reports an 11.7 GHz compact filter based on Scandium Aluminum Nitride (ScAlN) Film Bulk Acoustic Resonators (FBARs) and provides a detailed analysis of the fundamental challenges that limit performance when scaling to higher frequencies. A 50 {\\Omega} ladder filter based on single-layer thin film ScAlN with Platinum (Pt) electrodes was demonstrated at 11.7 GHz with a 3 dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 4.0% and an out of band rejection greater than 23.1 dB. However, the filter exhibits a moderate insertion loss (IL) of 6.8 dB, which is attributed to a limited Quality (Q) factor in the constituent resonators. Consequently, we identify and analyze three primary challenges in frequency scaling ScAlN FBARs with thinner film stacks: 1) degradation of piezoelectric thin-film crystal quality, 2) increased series resistance in ultra-thin electrodes, and 3) residual film stress that limits device size and structural integrity. By establishing a clear relationship between these fabrication-level challenges and the resulting device performance, this work provides critical insights for the future development of low-loss acoustic filters for millimeter-wave applications.

    "title": "Polarization control via artificial optical nonlinearity in dielectric metasurfaces",
    "abstract": "           Nonlinear optical phenomena are generally governed by geometry in matter systems, as they depend on the spatial arrangement of atoms within materials or molecules. Metasurfaces, through precisely designed geometries on a subwavelength scale, allow tailoring the optical response of a material far beyond its natural properties. Therefore, metasurfaces are highly appealing to enable the engineering of nonlinear optical interactions at an unprecedented level. Current studies on nonlinear metasurfaces predominantly focus on the phase control of the generated light. Nonetheless, investigating the tensorial nature of the nonlinearity of metasurfaces and its effect on the polarization of the generated light is critical to fully unlock a range of applications, such as nonlinear vector beam generation and nonlinear polarization imaging. Here, we study the artificial optical nonlinearity of a dielectric metasurface originating from its meta-atom symmetry and describe the third-order nonlinear behavior by considering the polarization degree of freedom. We establish an effective nonlinear medium model that serves as a design toolbox for developing amorphous silicon-based geometric metasurfaces with customizable features in third harmonic generation. We further extract quantitative values of the artificial nonlinear susceptibility tensor elements related to the investigated nonlinear process and geometry. The implemented functional devices demonstrate the versatility of dielectric metasurfaces in shaping the emitted light in terms of amplitude, phase, and polarization, for the precise engineering of novel nonlinear architectures targeting applications in nonlinear imaging and complex light generation.

    "abstract": "           A liquid crystal (LC) lens array based on double-layer composite electrodes, characterized by a large aperture, short focal length, and low operating voltage is demonstrated. The lens array consists of an LC layer, a top common electrode, a bottom double-layer composite electrode layer, and an oxide layer. The bottom double-layer composite electrode layer comprises the pixel electrodes and the auxiliary electrode. In focusing mode, the pixel electrodes receive operational voltage to establish the LC layer's electric field, with the auxiliary electrode applying reduced voltage for field optimization. Experiment results show that the proposed LC lens array achieves the shortest focal length of 3.3 mm when the pixel electrodes are set at 5.2 Vrms and the auxiliary electrode is set at 2.6 Vrms. This design addresses the technical challenge of achieving larger apertures (800 {\\mu}m or more), offering enhanced viewing zones and improved 3D performance. This configuration provides an ideal refractive index distribution in a relatively thick LC layer, enabling 2D/3D switchable display with performance superior to current LC lens arrays of equivalent aperture. Furthermore, the proposed structure demonstrates excellent tolerance to manufacturing errors.         ",

    "title": "Integrated photonic ultrawideband real-time spectrum sensing for 6G wireless networks",
    "abstract": "           The sixth generation (6G) wireless networks require dynamic spectrum management to optimize the utilization of scarce spectral resources and support emerging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) applications. This necessitates real-time spectrum sensing (RT-SS) capability with ultrawide measurement range, compact size, and low latency. Conventional electronic RT-SS solutions face critical challenges in operating across the millimeter-wave and sub-terahertz bands, which are essential spectra for 6G wireless. While photonic RT-SS has the potential to surpass this limitation, the current implementations feature limited bandwidths below 50 GHz and mostly rely on bulky dispersive fibers with high latency. Here, we address these challenges by developing an integrated photonic RT-SS system capable of ultrabroadband measurement from microwave to sub-terahertz bands, covering the full spectrum for 6G wireless. The photonic RT-SS circuit integrates a broadband electro-optic (EO) modulator for unknown signal loading, an EO tunable microring filter bank for high-speed parallel frequency-to-time mapping, as well as an EO comb for precise channel frequency referencing, all realized on a single thin-film lithium niobate chip. We achieve an unprecedented spectral measurement range beyond 120 GHz at a low latency of less than 100 ns. To validate the effectiveness of our photonic RT-SS system in future 6G scenes, we further propose a heuristic spectro-temporal resource allocation algorithm and conduct a proof-of-concept ISAC demonstration, where a radar adaptively access RT-SS-informed spectrally underutilized regions for high-quality target sensing under dynamic communication interferences. Our work presents a compact and cost-effective solution for efficient spectrum sharing and dynamic management in future 6G ISAC networks.         ",

    "abstract": "           Traditional sources of quantum-entangled photons, such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion, suffer from low flux, limiting clinical applications. We investigated whether clinical megavoltage (MV) radiotherapy beams can serve as dual-purpose sources, delivering therapeutic dose while simultaneously generating high-flux entangled photon pairs for quantum ghost imaging, quantum theranostics (QTX), and related applications. Using GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations, we modeled water-equivalent phantoms containing 2 cm spherical tumors loaded with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, 10 mg/mL). Clinical spectra at 6, 10, and 15 MV were simulated. Key metrics included 511 keV photon-pair yield, positronium lifetimes (time-resolved), Doppler and energy broadening (energy-resolved), signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), and entanglement retention at depths from 5 to 15 cm. Pair yields scaled with beam energy and AuNP concentration, reaching about 10^8 pairs per Gy per cm^3 in AuNP-loaded tumors. Positronium lifetime shifts (about 100 ps) reflected tumor oxygenation and reactive oxygen species, offering potential functional biomarkers. Doppler (1-3 keV) and AuNP-induced line broadening (0.5-1 keV) produced distinct spectroscopic signatures of electron density, tissue composition, and nanoparticle uptake. Time-resolved QTX revealed oxygenation and ROS levels, energy-resolved QTX probed tissue density and atomic composition, and combined modes enabled comprehensive theranostic imaging. Depth-dependent simulations achieved voxel SNRs exceeding 100. These findings demonstrate that clinical MV beams can serve as practical, high-flux entangled photon sources. Integrated time- and energy-resolved QTX supports functional and spectroscopic tumor imaging, enables nanoparticle optimization, and expands quantum imaging platforms from optical (eV) to therapeutic (hundreds of keV) regimes.

Directional couplers were inscribed into fluoride glass using femtosecond laser direct writing, forming low-loss waveguides with a high positive refractive index change. The waveguides were optimized for efficient guidance at a wavelength of 2.7 {\\textmu}m. Directional couplers with systematically varied coupling gap and interaction lengths were fabricated and experimentally characterized, demonstrating controllable power splitting ratios spanning from complete transmission (100:0) to balanced coupling (50:50). A directional coupler with a 7 {\\textmu}m coupling gap and a 1.5 mm interaction length, providing an 80:20 power splitting ratio, was integrated with a cladding-pumped Er:ZBLAN fiber to realize a ring laser cavity. The resulting device produced stable lasing at 2716.7 nm with an output power of 14.2 mW. This work represents the first realization of a fully fiber-chip integrated mid-infrared laser source and opens new avenues for 3D photonic integration in fluoride glasses, enabling design flexibility previously unattainable in traditional fiber-optics architectures.

A recent experiment has revealed that chiral molecules also exhibit an unexpected capability for spin-to-charge conversion, referred to as the inverse CISS (ICISS), opening unprecedented avenues for the study and application of chiral molecules. Here, we propose a specific theoretical explanation, suggesting that ICISS arises from the spin-dependent deflection of electrons caused by the interaction between the spin and chiral structure. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating that ICISS persists under strong disorder. Our model also reproduces the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in this experiment. Comparative analysis reveals that ICISS employs an unconventional spin-to-charge conversion mechanism distinct from conventional ISHE approaches. We provide a comprehensive explanation of ICISS, elucidate experimental phenomena, and pave the way for organic-based spintronics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Two-step photon upconversion solar cells (TPU-SCs) belong to the class of solar cells that in principle can exceed the Shockley--Queisser limit for single-junction solar cells. A TPU-SC basically consists of a wide-gap and a narrow-gap semiconductor layer, where intraband absorption of infrared (IR) photons by electrons accumulated at the conduction-band-edge discontinuity leads to an increase in the output current and voltage. This IR-induced upconversion process enables a better utilization of the broad solar spectrum, and quantum dots (QDs) can be added to improve the intraband transition rates in actual devices. In this study, we added an n--p--n double-tunnel-junction structure to an $\\mathrm{Al_{0.3}Ga_{0.7}As}$/GaAs TPU-SC including a QD layer to further enhance the contribution of intraband absorption to the output current. The double-tunnel-junction structure should suppress carrier recombination at the heterointerface and improve the extraction efficiency of electrons after intraband absorption. We performed two-color excitation experiments using IR and 784-nm light, and we particularly found that 784-nm light causes a significant amount of intraband transitions in this device. By employing rate equations, we clarify that this result demonstrates a higher intraband absorption efficiency due to the double-tunnel-junction structure. This highlights the potential of double-tunnel-junction structures for the realization of high-efficiency TPU-SCs.         ",

    "abstract": "           Biophotonics-and more recently, biointegrated photonics-offer transformative tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators-optical microcavities formed in spherical structures-have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing. Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW) laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss, well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels.

Tumor 'hijacking' of the pancreatic stromal structure limits the uptake of systemic chemotherapeutics. Localized drug delivery systems (DDS) using endoluminal techniques are widely utilized, with positive early results for improved control over tumor growth. There is a need for technologies that integrate endoluminal resources and intelligent material systems to better control the spatiotemporal delivery of chemotherapeutics. We demonstrate the ultrasound (US)-triggered localized release of therapeutics through the design of solvent traceless drug-loaded vinylbenzyl-functionalized gelatin (gel4vbc) nanoparticles (NPs) integrated with an electrospun fabric. Albumin-loaded NPs encapsulated into a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) coating of a poly(epsilon-caprolactone) fabric evidence tunable triggered NP delivery controlled by regulating PVA concentration (0-1 wt.%) and US intensity (0-3 W/cm2). The fixation of the NP-coated fabric to a magnetic tentacle robot (MTR) enables the automated manipulation into a phantom pancreatic duct before the US-triggered release of NP-loaded albumin and MTR retraction. Albumin release is controlled by varying the surface area of the NP-loaded MTR-coating fabric. Herein we have designed a novel DDS capable of facile integration into soft robotics and US-triggered delivery of therapeutic-loaded NPs.         ",

In order to ensure accurate capture, noise needs to be analyzed and compensated. In this paper, we model and analyze the acceleration noise generated by the test mass affected by the magnetic field in space. In this paper, we use the Tsyganenko model as the background magnetic field of the TQ orbit, calculate the magnetic field and magnetic field gradient of the satellite orbit from 1997 to 2023, analyze the acceleration noise due to the coupling of the residual magnetic moment, the induced magnetic moment with the magnetic field in space and the acceleration noise due to the Lorentz force, and calculate the acceleration integrated noise of the influence of the magnetic field on the test mass from the power spectral densities of the modeled magnetic field and the magnetic field gradient. The acceleration integrated noise of the magnetic field influence on the test mass is calculated from the power spectral density of the magnetic field and the magnetic field gradient obtained by the model. Through the simulation study, the acceleration of the test mass induced by the magnetic field in the space of the TQ orbit reaches the magnitude of $10^{-16}ms^{-1}Hz^{-1/2}$, which is an important source of the influencing noise. The acceleration noise induced by the magnetic field and the Lorentz force is relatively higher than that induced by the magnetic field gradient.         ",

    "abstract": "           The prediction of complex dynamics remains an open problem across many domains of physics, where nonlinearities and multiscale interactions severely limit the reliability of conventional forecasting methods. Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for information processing by exploiting the high dimensionality of the Hilbert space, where the dynamics of quantum systems take place. Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical reservoir architecture capable of handling multivariate time series through quantum evolution combined with classical memory enhancement. Our model employs a five-qubit transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian with input-modulated dynamics and temporal multiplexing, enabling the encoding of input signals over multiple timescales. We apply this framework to two paradigmatic models of chaotic behavior in fluid dynamics, where multiscale dynamics and nonlinearities play a dominant role: a low-dimensional truncation of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and the Lorenz-63 system. By systematically scanning the quantum system's parameter space, we identify regions that maximize forecasting performance, as measured by the Valid Prediction Time. The observed robustness and reliable performances for both dynamical systems suggest that this hybrid quantum approach offers a flexible platform for modelling complex nonlinear time series.

    "abstract": "           Continuously monitored quantum systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum metrology, where a central challenge is to identify measurement strategies that optimally extract information about unknown parameters encoded in the complex quantum state of emitted radiation. Different measurement strategies effectively access distinct temporal modes of the emitted field, and the resulting choice of mode can strongly impact the information available for parameter estimation. While a ubiquitous approach in quantum optics is to select frequency modes through spectral filtering, the metrological potential of this technique has not yet been systematically quantified. We develop a theoretical framework to assess this potential by modeling spectral detection as a cascaded quantum system, allowing us to reconstruct the full density matrix of frequency-filtered photonic modes and to compute their associated Fisher information. This framework provides a minimal yet general method to benchmark the performance of spectral measurements in quantum optics, allowing to identify optimal filtering strategies in terms of frequency selection, detector linewidth, and metrological gain accessible through higher-order frequency-resolved correlations and mean-field engineering. These results lay the groundwork for identifying and designing optimal sensing strategies in practical quantum-optical platforms.         ",

Unlike traditional cryptography, which relies on the computational difficulty of mathematical problems, QKD utilizes the inherent properties of quantum states to achieve information-theoretic security. This means that the security of the key exchange is guaranteed by the laws of physics, making it theoretically unbreakable even by an adversary with unlimited computational power. Currently, one of the most viable ways to implement QKD for communication is via photonics, namely, using phase-preserving long-distance optical fibers. The objective of this project is to implement photonic QKD in a laboratory setting. This will help demonstrate the protocol's robustness and provide a feasible implementation for educational demonstrations.         ",

Our approach leverages the quantum-classical correspondence between TOSPDC and its reverse classical process, three-wave sum-frequency generation (TSFG), to efficiently estimate the PTG rate. We apply this framework to nonlinear metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) in the optical range. From numerical analysis of non-collinear TSFG with degenerate input waves at qBIC wavelengths, we predict wavelength-tunable three-photon emission with spatio-angular correlations. These findings establish a novel method for modelling TOSPDC and also highlight the potential of nonlinear resonant metasurfaces as compact free-space photon triplet sources with quantum state control.

    "abstract": "           Radiative and nonradiative resonant couplings between defects are ubiquitous phenomena in photonic devices used in classical and quantum information technology applications. In this work we present a first principles approach to enable quantitative predictions of the energy transfer between defects in photonic cavities, beyond the dipole-dipole approximation and including the many-body nature of the electronic states. As an example, we discuss the energy transfer from a dipole like emitter to an F center in MgO in a spherical cavity. We show that the cavity can be used to controllably enhance or suppress specific spin flip and spin conserving transitions. Specifically, we predict that a ~10 to 100 enhancement in the resonant energy transfer rate can be gained in the case of the F center in MgO at ~10nm distances from a dipolar source, using rather moderate cavity with quality factor Q~400. We also show that a similar suppression in the transfer rate can be achieved by off-tuning the cavity resonance relative to the emitter transition energy. The framework presented here is general and readily applicable to a wide range of devices where localized emitters are embedded in micro-spheres, core-shell nanoparticles, and dielectric Mie resonators. Hence, our approach paves the way to predict how to control energy transfer in quantum memories and in ultra-high density optical memories, and in a variety of quantum information platforms.

Fast, cost-effective, labor-efficient, and non-intrusive autonomous field inspection remains a challenge. Approaches using imaging drone, i.e., Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system integrated with high resolution visible imaging sensors, have been developed to address these challenges; however, these approaches are often limited by insufficient imaging contrast. Here we report a polarimetry-based method with a polarization imaging system integrated on UAV to enhance imaging contrast for in-situ detection of heliostat mirrors without interrupting field operation. We developed an optical model for skylight polarization pattern to simulate the polarization images of heliostat mirrors and obtained optimized waypoints for polarimetric imaging drone flight path to capture images with enhanced contrast. The polarimetric imaging-based method improved the success rate of edge detections in scenarios which were challenging for mirror edge detection with conventional imaging sensors. We have performed field tests to achieve significantly enhanced heliostat edge detection success rate and investigate the feasibility of integrating polarimetric imaging method with existing imaging-based heliostat inspection methods, i.e., Polarimetric Imaging Heliostat Inspection Method (PIHIM). Our preliminary field test results suggest that the PIHIM hold the promise to enable sufficient imaging contrast for real-time autonomous imaging and detection of heliostat field, thus suitable for non-interruptive fast CSP field inspection during its operation.

    "abstract": "           We present a detailed derivation and discussion of cavity Born-Oppenheimer coupled cluster (CBO-CC) theory and address cavity-modified electron correlation in the vibrational strong coupling regime. Methodologically, we combine the recently proposed cavity reaction potential (CRP) approach with the Lagrangian formulation of CC theory and derive a self-consistent CRP-CC method at the singles and doubles excitations level (CRP-CCSD). The CRP-CC approach is formally similar to implicit solvation CC models and provides access to the CBO-CC electronic ground state energy minimized in cavity coordinate space on a CC level of theory. A hierarchy of linearisation schemes (lCRP-CCSD) similar to canonical CC theory systematically lifts the self-consistent nature of the CRP-CCSD approach and mitigates numerical cost by approximating electron correlation effects in energy minimization. We provide a thorough comparison of CRP-CCSD, lCRP-CCSD and CRP-Hartee-Fock methods for a cavity-modified Menshutkin reaction, pyridine$+$CH$_3$Br, and cavity-induced collective electronic effects in microsolvation energies of selected methanol-water clusters. We find lCRP-CCSD methods to provide excellent results compared to the self-consistent CRP-CCSD approach in the few-molecule limit. We furthermore observe significant differences between mean-field and correlated results in both reactive and collective scenarios. Our work emphasizes the non-trivial character of electron correlation under vibrational strong coupling and provides a starting point for further developments in ab initio vibro-polaritonic chemistry beyond the mean-field approximation.

    "abstract": "           Hybrid integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials with nanophotonic platforms has enabled compact optoelectronic devices by leveraging the unique optical and electronic properties of atomically thin layers. While most efforts have focused on coupling 2D materials to pre-defined photonic structures, the broader potential of 2D heterostructures for actively engineering the photonic environment remains largely unexplored. In our previous work, we employed single types of 2D material and showed that even monolayer flakes can locally induce high-$Q$ nanocavities in photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides through effective refractive index modulation. Here, we extend this concept by demonstrating that further transferring of 2D material flakes onto the induced hybrid nanocavity to form heterostructures enable more flexibility for post-fabrication dielectric environment engineering of the cavity. We show that the high-$Q$ hybrid nanocavities remain robust under sequential flake stacking. Coupling optically active MoTe$_{2}$ flake to these cavities yields enhanced photoluminescence and reduced emission lifetimes, consistent with Purcell-enhanced light-matter interactions. Additionally, encapsulation with a top hBN layer leads to a significant increase in the cavity $Q$ factor, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our results show that these heterostructure stacks not only preserve the cavity quality but also introduce an additional degrees of control -- via flake thickness, refractive indices, size and interface design -- offering a richer dielectric environment modulation landscape than what is achievable with monolayers alone, providing a versatile method toward scalable and reconfigurable hybrid nanophotonic systems.

One intriguing possibility is that a system with a spatially bounded supersonic flow may evolve into a self-oscillating state that periodically emits solitons, in a process originating from the well-known Landau instability. Here, we report observation of self-oscillating supersonic flows in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid. By imposing a local particle sink with strong loss, we induce a convergent radial flow forming an acoustic analogue of a black-hole horizon and an inner horizon around the sink. The observed superflow appears to be modulated by quasi-periodic bursts of superluminal signals. We measure their frequencies and find agreement with numerical simulations of soliton oscillation frequencies within the black-hole horizon. The presented experiment demonstrates a new method for creating supersonic flows in atomic superfluids, which may find applications in quantum simulations of curved spacetime, supersonic turbulence, and self-oscillating dynamics in dissipative many-body systems.
