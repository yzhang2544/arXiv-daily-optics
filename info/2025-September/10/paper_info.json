    "abstract": "           Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a powerful tool for extracting optical and electrical parameters, as well as probing internal structures and surface morphology of materials. However, conventional simulation techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD), face challenges in accurately modeling THz wave propagation. These difficulties arise from the broad operating bandwidth of THz-TDS (~0.1-10 THz), which demands extremely high temporal resolution to capture pulse dynamics and fine spatial resolution to resolve microstructures and interface effects. To address these limitations, we introduce physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into THz-TDS modeling for the first time. Through a comprehensive analysis of forward problems in the time domain, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of PINNs as a powerful framework for advancing THz wave simulation and analysis.

    "abstract": "           Optical systems capable of generating fields with sub-wavelength spatial features have become standard in science and engineering research and industry. Pertinent examples include atom- and ion-based quantum computers and optical lithography setups. So far, no tools exist to characterize such fields - both intensity and polarization - at sub-wavelength length scales. We use a single trapped atomic ion, confined to approximately 40 nm X 40 nm X 180 nm to sense a laser light field at a wavelength of 370 nm. With its spatial extent smaller than the absorption cross-section of a resonant detector, the ion-sensor operates at the fundamental limit of spatial resolution. Our technique relies on developing an analytical model of the ion-light interaction and using the model to extract the intensity and polarization. An important insight provided in this work is also that the inverse of this model can be learned, in a restricted sense, on a deep neural network, speeding up the intensity and polarization readout by five orders of magnitude. This speed-up makes the technique field-deployable to characterize optical instruments by probing light at the sub-wavelength scale.         ",

In this paper we focus on a new high-bandwidth frequency multiplexed TES readout system developed for CUPID, a neutrinoless double beta decay experiment that will replace CUORE. In order to achieve the high energy resolution requirements for CUPID, the readout noise of the system must be kept to a minimum. Low TES operating resistance and long wiring between the readout SQUID and the warm electronics are needed for CUPID, prompting a careful consideration of the design parameters of this application of frequency multiplexing. In this work, we characterize the readout noise of the newly designed frequency multiplexed TES readout system for CUPID and construct a noise model to understand it. We find that current sharing between the SQUID coil impedance and other branches of the circuit, as well as the long output wiring, worsen the readout noise of the system. To meet noise requirements, a SQUID with a low input inductance, high transimpedance and/or low dynamic impedance is needed, and the wiring capacitance should be kept as small as possible. Alternatively, the option of adding a cryogenic low-noise amplifier at the output of the SQUID should be explored.         ",

We uncover a frequency-disorder mediated synchronization resonance in coupled external-cavity semiconductor diode lasers. Specifically, we find that intrinsic random frequency detuning among the lasers can enhance synchronization, reaching a maximum at an optimal coupling strength in the weak-coupling regime. The resonance is genuinely disorder-mediated, as it vanishes in the corresponding disorder-free system. To explain this phenomenon, we develop a physical theory based on an effective thermodynamic potential, which also accounts for the associated scaling behavior.

By analyzing the multiplication factor spectrum of the projected local density of states, we can trace and control these OPs, enabling strong spatial and spectral confinement of single-nanoparticle SPRs. Simulations reveal that a photonic crystal substrate can reduce the mode volume by fivefold and boost the quality factor by over 80 times compared to a metal nanoparticle on a dielectric substrate. Proof-of-concept experiments using two types of leaking Fabry-Perot photonic substrates demonstrate active manipulation of SPRs in both \"open\" and \"closed\" OP states. This multidimensional photonic substrate engineering establishes a customizable platform for single-nanoparticle plasmonics, potentially transforming applications that were previously limited by spectral localization.

Selectively exciting molecules to high vibrational states with infrared lasers to catalyze ground-state chemical reactions is a challenging task. Here, we propose a two-cavity mode setup in the electronic strong coupling regime inspired by the process of Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) to selectively populate excited vibrational states. One cavity mode actively pumps the molecular system, while the other provides a highly effective and tunable decay channel via photon leakage. We demonstrate the ability to selectively populate vibrational states for coherent and incoherent light sources using a molecular model system.

Using an open quantum system approach, we identify for the simplest case the parameter space where the laser reaches tens of picowatts of power with a sub-millihertz linewidth. Studying the impact of inhomogeneous frequency broadening and variations in atom-cavity coupling on the superradiant emission, we find the laser properties robust with respect to such perturbations, also thanks to the occurrence of synchronization of the atomic dipoles. We then consider a two-site configuration, in which atoms in each site are equally coupled to the cavity and have equal detunings, with different values for the two ensembles. We find for balanced and imbalanced atom numbers that synchronization leads in a certain parameter space to a single narrow spectral line whose central frequency follows the weighted average frequency. This result indicates that sequential loading can enable continuous superradiant emission for metrological applications, provided that the relative frequencies of the two ensembles are controlled to the level required by the target stability.

Our primary objective is to determine the joint resonances (eigenfrequencies) of the coupled cavity-particle system without imposing restrictions on the coupling strength. Unlike conventional quantum optics models, such as the Jaynes-Cummings model, which typically consider interactions with a limited number of cavity modes and may suffer from causality violations, our formulation fully accounts for the complete mode spectrum of the cavity, ensuring strict causality. From a mathematical standpoint, we introduce a novel singularity extraction technique (renormalization) for the local field Green's function, $G^{\\text{loc}}(r)$, which represents the field at the particle's location due to backscattering of its own radiation. This function is defined as the difference between the cavity Green's function and its free-space counterpart, resulting in a numerically challenging $\\infty - \\infty$ form.

    "abstract": "           The global landscape for quantum technologies (QTs) is rapidly changing, and proper understanding of their impact and subsequent regulations need to match this pace. A Responsible Innovation (RI) approach and guiding principles have been proposed to accompany this development. We examine practical efforts globally and in Canada, from industry to research to governments, and analyze the current status of quantum technological advances under the RI framework. We analyze and compare what is being done internationally, identify gaps in the Canadian strategy, propose initiatives to fill those gaps, and highlight areas where Canada is leading or where more work is needed.

    "abstract": "           Quantum computational chemistry holds great promise for simulating molecular systems more efficiently than classical methods by leveraging quantum bits to represent molecular wavefunctions. However, current implementations face significant limitations in accuracy due to hardware noise and algorithmic constraints. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a hybrid framework that learns molecular wavefunction using a combination of an efficient quantum circuit and a deep neural network. This approach enhances computational efficiency and accuracy, surpassing traditional quantum computational chemistry methods. Numerical benchmarking on molecular systems shows that our hybrid quantum-neural wavefunction approach achieves near-chemical accuracy, comparable to advanced quantum and classical techniques. Experimental validation on a superconducting quantum computer, using the isomerization reaction of cyclobutadiene, further demonstrates its practical applicability, with high accuracy in energy estimation and significant resilience to noise.

    "title": "Position-correlated biphoton wavefront sensing for quantum adaptive imaging",
    "abstract": "           Quantum imaging with spatially entangled photons offers advantages such as enhanced spatial resolution, robustness against noise, and counter-intuitive phenomena, while a biphoton spatial aberration generally degrades its performance. Biphoton aberration correction has been achieved by using classical beams to detect the aberration source or scanning the correction phase on biphotons if the source is unreachable. Here, a new method named position-correlated biphoton Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing is introduced, where the phase pattern added on photon pairs with a strong position correlation is reconstructed from their position centroid distribution at the back focal plane of a microlens array. Experimentally, biphoton phase measurement and adaptive imaging against the disturbance of a plastic film are demonstrated. This single-shot method is a more direct and efficient approach toward quantum adaptive optics, suitable for integration into quantum microscopy, remote imaging, and communication.         ",

    "title": "Nonlinear-linear duality for multipath quantum interference",
    "abstract": "           In quantum optics, the postselection amplitude of a nondegenerate parametric down-conversion (PDC) process is linked to a beamsplitter (BS) via partial time reversal, up to a normalization coefficient which is related to the parametric gain [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 117, 33107 (2020)]. A special example where the gain is low is reminiscent of Klyshko's advanced-wave picture in quantum imaging. Here, we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then, we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for $Q$-function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.         ",
