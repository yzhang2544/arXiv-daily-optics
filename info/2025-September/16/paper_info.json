    "abstract": "           Optical sound pressure measurement is a promising technology to establish primary acoustic standards without reliance on specific types of microphones. We developed a precision optical sound pressure measurement system by combining a Fabry-p\u00e9rot optical cavity, a phase-stabilized optical frequency comb, and a custom-made phasemeter. The optical cavity detects changes in the air's refractive index induced by sound waves as changes in its resonance frequency. A continuous-wave laser frequency is stabilized at the resonance, and the frequency comb detects the changes in the laser frequency. The frequency changes are measured with high sensitivity and accuracy using a phasemeter that we developed. The sound pressures measured by this system agreed with the measurement value obtained using a reference microphone within 5% at sound pressure levels of 78 dB and 84 dB, within a frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 kHz. A systematic deviation of 2.6% was observed, with the optical system yielding higher values than the microphone. To identify the cause of this deviation, we performed vibration displacement measurements of the cavity mirrors and finite element analysis, which revealed that fluctuations in the optical path length due to insufficient fixation of the mirrors were responsible.

Following a description of the overall nature of this tension, with due attention to recent observational developments, a quantum cosmology framework based on the Weyl-Wigner phase-space quantum approach is presented. This circumvents the discrepancy between early- and late-time Universe predictions for the Hubble constant, $H_0$. The emergence of quantum-origin corrections dependent on a single parameter -- mediated by (generic) localized phase-space quantum states free of data analysis -- yields predictions for $H_0$ that smoothly interpolate between early- and late-time phenomenological values, thereby joining the plethora of solutions for the Hubble tension.

    "abstract": "           Ring-polymer surface hopping (RPSH) is a unique mixed quantum-classical dynamics method that seamlessly incorporates nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) into non-adiabatic dynamics simulations via the extended phase-space of a classical ring polymer. Here, we systematically investigate several variants of RPSH in the frameworks of centroid and bead approximations (RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA) in modeling the dynamics of the spin-boson system across different reaction regimes, reorganization energies, and temperatures. Moreover, the effects of including the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) on the performance of the RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA methods are investigated. Our results show that the RPSH-CA method, where non-adiabatic transitions are handled at the centroid level, reliably captures NQEs and remains robust across different reaction regimes. Adding DBOC improves the method's accuracy in specific intermediate and non-adiabatic reaction regimes at low temperature. Conversely, adding DBOC to the conventional fewest-switches surface hopping method was found to over-damp the dynamics significantly and reduce accuracy, especially at low temperatures. On the other hand, RPSH-BA results, where non-adiabatic transitions are handled at the level of individual beads of the ring polymers, are generally unreliable unless in the adiabatic reaction regime and at high temperature. The inclusion of DBOC is not particularly helpful in remedying this erratic behavior. As such, RPSH-BA is not recommended for including NQEs in condensed-phase non-adiabatic dynamics simulations despite its early successful reports in 1D scattering models. Our findings clarify when geometric corrections are beneficial or detrimental to non-adiabatic simulations using RPSH, providing practical guidance for atomistic condensed-phase applications.

    "abstract": "           The thermal diffusivity measurement of impacted composites using pulsed methods presents an ill-posed inverse problem influenced by multiple factors such as sample thickness, cooling duration, and excitation energy. In this study, a novel excitation method, evaporative cryocooling, was introduced for measuring the thermal diffusivity of tested samples. Compared to conventional excitation modalities, evaporative cryocooling excitation is compact, portable, and low cost. However, evaporative cryocooling cannot be considered a pulsed method due to its prolonged excitation duration. In general, it is difficult to measure thermal diffusivity based on non-impulsive pulsed excitation at times commensurate with the pulse duration, often due to ill-defined pulse shape and width and the subsequent potentially complicated thermal response which may be subject to diffusive broadening. To address this challenge, inverse physics-informed neural networks (IPINNs) were introduced in this work and integrated with an evaporative cryocooling method. The Parker method combined with a photothermal method was employed as a reference. To improve the accuracy of both IPINNs and Parker methods, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) was employed for measuring the thickness of impacted composites. Simulations and experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of the IPINN-based approach.         ",

By retaining explicit electronic degrees of freedom, our approach further enables a faithful embedding of quantum and classical degrees of freedom that captures long-range electrostatics and the quantum response to a classical environment to infinite order. As validation, we compute the proton dissociation constants of weak acids and the kinetic rate of an enzymatic reaction entirely from first principles, reproducing experimental measurements within chemical accuracy or their uncertainties.

By harnessing quantum superposition and entanglement, it hybridized the critical computational kernels (termed as quantum finite particle method). A resource-efficient quantum computational strategy on multi-partitioned zones was proposed, which leverages a fixed small-scale quantum circuit as a fundamental processing unit to handle inner product for arbitrarily sized arrays. This approach employs iterative nesting of the quantum-core operation to accommodate varying input dimensions while maintaining hardware feasibility throughout. Motivated with developed quantum framework, the novel numerical discretization for hybrid quantum computational particle dynamics can be derived commonly and applied in fluid flows. Through a sequence of numerical experiments purposefully, the proposed numerical model was thoroughly validated and analyzed. Results demonstrate that integrating quantum computing to hybridize conventional linear combinations of particle dynamics serves as an effective high performance computing paradigm. By further extending into the numerical investigation of viscoelastic, highly elastic, and purely elastic fluids under high Weissenberg number conditions, the applicability of quantum-hybrid framework is significantly broadened. These advances provide critical insights facilitating the transition of quantum-enhanced fluid simulation toward practical engineering applications.         ",

We present a novel system that integrates volumetric US imaging with 3D needle tracking by combining a fiber-optic hydrophone embedded in the needle and a sparse spiral US array. Real-time volumetric imaging was achieved using plane-wave techniques, while precise needle tip tracking was enabled through communication between the probe and hydrophone.

    "abstract": "           Polaritons - hybrid light-matter states formed from the strong coupling of a bright molecular transition with a confined photonic mode - may offer new opportunities for optical control of molecular behavior. Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) has been reported to impact ground-state chemical reactivity, but its influence on electronic excited-state dynamics remains unexplored. Here, we take a first step towards excited-state VSC by demonstrating optical modulation of the ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy), (bpy = 2,2-bipyridine) complex under VSC using femtosecond ultraviolet (UV)-pump/infrared (IR)-probe spectroscopy. We establish ground-state VSC of ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) in a microfluidic Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity equipped with indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated mirrors. ITO is effectively dichroic as it is reflective in the IR and transmissive in the UV-visible and therefore minimizes optical interference. Excitation with UV pump light drives ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) into a manifold of electronic excited states which subsequently undergo non-radiative relaxation dynamics. We probe the transient response of the strongly-coupled system in the mid-IR, observing both Rabi contraction and cavity-filtered excited state absorption signatures. We reconstruct the intrinsic response of intracavity molecules from the transient cavity transmission spectra to enable quantitative comparison with extracavity control experiments. We report no changes in the excited-state dynamics of ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) under ground-state VSC. However, we do observe significant amplification of transient vibrational signals due to classical cavity-enhanced optical effects. This effort lays the groundwork to pursue direct excited-state VSC aimed at modulating photochemical reactivity.         ",

    "abstract": "           Submarine cables play a critical role in global internet connectivity, energy transmission, and communication but remain vulnerable to accidental damage and sabotage. Recent incidents in the Baltic Sea highlighted the need for enhanced monitoring to protect this vital infrastructure. Traditional vessel detection methods, such as synthetic aperture radar, video surveillance, and multispectral satellite imagery, face limitations in real-time processing, adverse weather conditions, and coverage range. This paper explores Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) as an alternative by repurposing submarine telecommunication cables as large-scale acoustic sensor arrays. DAS offers continuous real-time monitoring, operates independently of cooperative systems like the \"Automatic Identification System\" (AIS), being largely unaffected by lighting or weather conditions. However, existing research on DAS for vessel tracking is limited in scale and lacks validation under real-world conditions. To address these gaps, a general and systematic methodology is presented for vessel detection and distance estimation using DAS. Advanced machine learning models are applied to improve detection and localization accuracy in dynamic maritime environments. The approach is evaluated over a continuous ten-day period, covering diverse ship and operational conditions, representing one of the largest-scale DAS-based vessel monitoring studies to date, and for which we release the full evaluation dataset. Results demonstrate DAS as a practical tool for maritime surveillance, with an overall F1-score of over 90% in vessel detection, and a mean average error of 141 m for vessel distance estimation, bridging the gap between experimental research and real-world deployment.

For open-shell singlet states, excited state calculations can be stabilized with the appropriate trial states, but their quality can have a larger effect on the accuracy in AFQMC. We find that active space-based configuration interaction trial states are often not sufficient to obtain accurate results. We instead use truncated equation of motion coupled cluster with single and double excitations (EOM-CCSD) as trial states. We benchmark the performance of these calculations on a set of small and medium molecules and polyacenes, focusing on predominantly single excitations. We find that the AFQMC results, obtained at a per-sample cost scaling of $O(N^6)$, are systematically more accurate than those obtained using EOM-CCSD, reducing excitation energy errors by approximately half for open-shell singlets. In regimes where EOM-CC triples are impractical, these results position AFQMC as a scalable, higher-accuracy complement for low-lying excited states.         ",

    "abstract": "           Photonic neuromorphic computing offers compelling advantages in power efficiency and parallel processing, but often falls short in realizing scalable nonlinearity and long-term memory. We overcome these limitations by employing silicon microring resonator (MRR) networks. These integrated photonic circuits enable compact, high-throughput neuromorphic computing by simultaneously exploiting spatial, temporal, and wavelength dimensions. This work advances the investigation of MRR networks for photonics-based machine learning (ML). We demonstrate the system's effectiveness on two widely used image classification benchmarks, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, by encoding images directly into time sequences. In particular, we enhance the computational performance of a linear readout classifier within the reservoir computing paradigm through the strategic use of multiple physical output ports, diverse laser wavelengths, and varied input power levels. Moreover, we achieve substantially improved accuracies in a single-pixel classification setting without relying on digital memory, thanks to the inherent memory and parallelism of our MRR network.

This technique is, in principle, wavelength-independent and, therefore, can link different spectral regions from both the excitation and probe sides.

Here, we demonstrate record-breaking, non-volatile control of optical anisotropy in two-dimensional ReS2 via ferroelectric gating with aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN). Our ferroelectric field-effect transistors achieve near-unity (~95%) LD tunability of differential reflectance at room temperature--the highest reported for any electrically controlled 2D optical system. Crucially, the programmed optical states exhibit exceptional retention exceeding 12,000 seconds without applied bias, enabling true non-volatile optical memory. Through combined experimental characterization and ab initio calculations, we reveal that ferroelectric polarization switching induces substantial asymmetric charge transfer to ReS2, selectively populating conduction band states and triggering structural distortions that dramatically enhance optical anisotropy in the \"up\" polarization state while leaving the \"down\" state unperturbed. This ferroelectric-semiconductor coupling provides a universal platform for voltage-programmable, energy-efficient photonic devices with dynamic polarization control, addressing critical needs in integrated photonics as well as programmable far-field optics and telecommunications infrastructure.

We investigate a subset of the available filter functions, demonstrating that a N = 4 input triangular mesh with M = 3 layers may be operated via self-configuration algorithms to filter M arbitrary wavelengths from a given input spectrum. The tunable nature of the architecture enables preconfigured filter functions to be swept in the spectral domain continuously over the free spectral range of the device. This removes any strict requirements between the design parameters of the architecture and the center wavelength of a desired filter function. With this architecture, we experimentally demonstrate arbitrary wavelength rejection filters with contrasts as deep as 40 dB. Further, by intentionally selecting the center wavelengths of each filter function to lie along a wavelength grid we demonstrate deep wavelength division demultiplexing (DWDM) with inter-channel crosstalk between -25 dB and -40 dB. Unlike typical DWDM systems, in this architecture the center wavelength of each channel is not fixed at fabrication and instead may be swept or reordered arbitrarily. This device demonstrates advantages over typical methods for DWDM, Raman spectroscopy, and correlation spectroscopy as well as other applications.         ",

Here we test MCS sensitivity to spatial scales of surface heterogeneity using a framework of experiments initialised from scale-filtered SM. We demonstrate the control of SM heterogeneity on MCS populations, and the mechanistic chain via which spatial variability propagates through surface fluxes to convective boundary layer development and storm environments. When all sub-synoptic SM variability is homogenised, peak MCS counts drop by 23%, whereas maintaining small-scale variability yields a weaker decrease due to higher primary initiation. In sensitivity experiments, boundary layer development prior to MCSs is similar to that over mesoscale dry SM anomalies, but instead driven by diffuse cloud-free slots of increased shortwave radiation.

We study ensembles of interacting quantum emitters coherently driven by a laser field and coupled to photonic structures, focusing on the hybrid description of emitters dressed by light. The interplay among quantum emitters, coherent driving, and photonic environments reveals a rich landscape of cooperative effects. While single-emitter dressing has been widely studied, we address collective phenomena in two non-identical emitters modelled as two-level systems. Strong interaction forms a dimer exhibiting superradiant and subradiant states, with two-photon resonances directly connecting ground and doubly excited states. This nonlinear process, central to the Thesis, enables new regimes of cooperative light-matter physics. Analytical studies show how interactions reshape observables such as emission intensity, photon statistics, and spectra, offering implications for quantum metrology. The sensitivity of two-photon processes to emitter distance and driving strength enables high-precision sensing and sub-wavelength imaging. Unexpectedly, we find that off-resonant virtual states may gain population through dissipation, redefining their role in open systems. To capture this, we develop a hierarchical adiabatic elimination method for metastable dynamics. We also analyze entanglement in emitters coupled to a lossy cavity, identifying five mechanisms, including the frequency-resolved Purcell effect introduced here. This selective enhancement stabilizes cooperative states and enables scalable entanglement. Our models, tailored to solid-state platforms such as quantum dots and molecular aggregates, address challenges like inhomogeneous broadening and decoherence, demonstrating the feasibility of harnessing cooperative light-matter effects for quantum technologies.

Here we employ the quantum computed moments (QCM) method, based on the Lanczos cluster expansion, to estimate the dipole moment of the water molecule on an IBM Quantum superconducting quantum device.

Quantum networks are the solution to overcome point-to-point limitations, but they simultaneously invite a challenging open question: How should quantum networks be designed to effectively and efficiently guarantee high rates? Now that performance and physical topology are inexorably linked, this question is not easy, but the answer is essential for a future quantum internet to be successful. In this work, we offer crucial insight into this open question for complex optical-fiber quantum networks. Using realistic descriptions of quantum networks via random network models and practical end-to-end routing protocols, we reveal critical phenomena associated with large-scale quantum networks.

Floe size can be observed by processing visual-range imagery from ships, aircraft, or satellites. However, autonomously capturing floe boundaries from imagery remains challenging, particularly due to the heterogeneity of sea ice, which impairs boundary definition and reduces image clarity. This study evaluates the accuracy of sea ice floe segmentation using the gradient vector flow (GVF) active contour method, the deep learning-based Segment Anything Model (SAM), and a hybrid approach combining GVF and SAM. These methods are evaluated on a representative subset of a large dataset of close-range, high-resolution sea ice imagery, collected from cameras aboard an icebreaker during an Antarctic winter expedition. Spanning a wide range of ice conditions and image clarity in the MIZ, the subset provides a rigorous test bed of segmentation approaches. Their performance is assessed in terms of floe detection accuracy, floe size distribution, and ice concentration, with results compared against a manually segmented benchmark. The findings indicate that SAM, when used in prompt-driven mode, offers the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Its strong performance in estimating sea ice concentration and detecting floes, while maintaining close agreement with benchmark floe size distributions, makes it suitable for real-time applications and scalable analysis of large imagery datasets.

While thermal convection schemes using two-phase cooling in microfluidic networks or liquid immersion are proving effective, further progress requires tackling the intrinsic thermal resistance of a liquid/solid (L/S) interface, quantified by the thermal slip length. Theoretical models and experimental tools for estimating this length have been developed for superfluid/metal interfaces but no comparable tools exist for systems at non-cryogenic temperatures. Researchers have therefore come to rely heavily on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to understand the influence of various parameters. But despite considerable effort, no actual relations have been proposed. Our study of 180 systems describing a liquid layer confined between identical crystals at different temperatures highlights the influence of correlated behavior throughout the L/S contact zone. When rescaled by key variables in the zone, the data for the thermal slip length exhibit excellent collapse onto two power law relations dependent on the peak value of the in-plane structure factor of the first liquid layer and the ratio of dominant frequencies pegged to the maxima in the vibrational density of states of the first liquid and solid layer.

We assume a Gaussian laser driver with matched spot size and amplitude and investigate both self-guiding in a uniform-density plasma and guiding in a preformed plasma channel with matched radius. To interpret the simulation results quantitatively, we derive novel analytical expressions for the maximum electron energy and the corresponding acceleration distance, accounting for the effects of laser diffraction and energy depletion. Based on the results obtained, we discuss the potential scalability of the optimal input (plasma density, pulse duration, amplitude, spot size, and channel radius) and output (electron energy, electron charge, acceleration length, and acceleration efficiency) parameters to laser systems of arbitrary energy.

    "abstract": "           The chaotic dynamics of small-scale vorticity plays a key role in understanding and controlling turbulence, with direct implications for energy transfer, mixing, and coherent structure evolution. However, measuring or controlling its dynamics remains a major conceptual and experimental challenge due to its transient and chaotic nature. Here we use a combination of experiments, theory and simulations to show that small magnetic particles of different densities, exploring flow regions of distinct vorticity statistics, can act as effective probes for measuring and forcing turbulence at its smallest scale. The interplay between the magnetic torque, from an externally controllable magnetic field, and hydrodynamic stresses, from small-scale turbulent vorticity, reveals an extremely rich phenomenology. Notably, we present the first observation of stochastic resonance for particles in turbulence: turbulent fluctuations, effectively acting as noise, counterintuitively enhance the particle rotational response to external forcing. We identify a pronounced resonant peak in particle rotational phase-lag when the applied magnetic field matches the characteristic intensity of small-scale vortices. Furthermore, we uncover a novel symmetry-breaking mechanism: an oscillating magnetic field with zero-mean angular velocity remarkably induces net particle rotation in turbulence with zero-mean vorticity, as turbulent fluctuations aid the particle in \"surfing\" the magnetic field. Our findings offer insights into flexible particle manipulation in complex flows and open up a novel magnetic resonance-based approach for measuring vorticity: magnetic particles as probes emit detectable magnetic fields, enabling turbulence quantification even under optically-inaccessible conditions.

Initially, a tuneable cylindrical oxygen-free copper cavity is read out using a low noise microwave amplifier feeding a heterodyne receiver. The cavity is housed in a dilution refrigerator and threaded by a solenoidal magnetic field, nominally 8T. The apparatus also houses a magnetic field shield for housing superconducting electronics, and several other fixed-frequency resonators for use in testing and commissioning various prototype quantum electronic devices sensitive at a range of axion masses in the range 2.0 to 40 micro-eV/c2. The apparatus as currently configured is intended as a test stand for electronics over the relatively wide frequency band attainable with the TM010 cavity mode used for axion searches.

While integrated technologies dominate, free-space architectures are emerging as attractive alternatives, offering broad bandwidth and direct manipulation of optical modes without confinement in waveguides. A key challenge for scalability lies in circuit depth, as the number of layers manipulating the optical field typically grows with the system size. Here, we introduce a programmable free-space photonic platform that performs high-dimensional unitary transformations using only three layers. Information is encoded in structured light modes defined by circular polarization and quantized transverse momenta, and processed with spatial light modulators interleaved with half-wave plates. We implement unitaries that are equivalent to quantum walks over up to 30 time steps, in one- and two-dimensional lattices, distributing a single input mode across more than 7,000 outputs, where conventional approaches would require tens or hundreds of layers. Despite being restricted to translationally-invariant systems, the platform supports diverse quantum walk dynamics, including disorder, synthetic gauge fields, and topological effects, previously explored only in separate experiments. Using coincidence detection with a time-tagging camera, we show compatibility with quantum optics protocols and provide examples of quantum walks of heralded single photons. These results contribute to establish free-space optical processors as promising resources for high-dimensional quantum simulation and scalable optical information processing.         ",

Because of this structure, we can use just a few spatially localized sensor measurements to reconstruct the full state of a complex system. The quality of this reconstruction, especially in the presence of sensor noise, depends significantly on the spatial configuration of the sensors. Multiple algorithms based on gappy interpolation and QR factorization have been proposed to optimize sensor placement. Here, instead of an algorithm that outputs a single \"optimal\" sensor configuration, we take a statistical mechanics view to compute the full landscape of sensor interactions induced by the training data. The two key advances of this paper are the recasting of the sensor placement landscape in an Ising model form and a regularized reconstruction that significantly decreases reconstruction error for few sensors. In addition, we provide first uncertainty quantification of the sparse sensing reconstruction and open questions about the shape of reconstruction risk curve. Mapping out these data-induced sensor interactions allows combining them with external selection criteria and anticipating sensor replacement impacts.         ",

However, extending these concepts to non-equilibrium systems is an outstanding challenge. Despite recent progress in the study of dynamical phases, the universality classes and scaling laws for non-equilibrium phenomena are far less understood than those in equilibrium. In this work, using a trapped-ion quantum simulator with single-spin resolution, we investigate the non-equilibrium nature of critical fluctuations following a quantum quench to the critical point. We probe the scaling of spin fluctuations after a series of quenches to the critical Hamiltonian of a long-range Ising model. With systems of up to 50 spins, we show that the amplitude and timescale of the post-quench fluctuations scale with system size with distinct universal critical exponents, depending on the quench protocol. While a generic quench can lead to thermal critical behavior, we find that a second quench from one critical state to another (i.e.~a double quench) results in a new universal non-equilibrium behavior, identified by a set of critical exponents distinct from their equilibrium counterparts. Our results demonstrate the ability of quantum simulators to explore universal scaling beyond equilibrium.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.

    "abstract": "           High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene. The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with 48dB dynamic range.
