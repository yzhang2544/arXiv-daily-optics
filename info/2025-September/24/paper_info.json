    "abstract": "           Many modern sensing, processing, and fabrication technologies depend upon the sequential scanning of laser light. Due to inertial, thermal, and electrical limitations, the speed of a typical laser deflector is inversely related to its optical invariant and therefore the number of resolvable spots it can address. Passive optical systems have been developed that can effectively double the optical invariant and maximum throughput of a single deflector. We present a method for increasing the effective optical invariant beyond 2$\\times$ by repeated relaying of the deflected beam onto the deflector in an optical loop created within a cavity. We use this Relayed-Loop Optically Amplified Deflection (ReLOAD) approach to accomplish 8$\\times$ amplification of electro-optical (EO) deflection, a deflection technology with unparalleled speed, but limited optical invariant. Using ReLOAD, we demonstrate 10 kHz frame rate imaging, 1 MHz line scan rate, and $\\mu$s step times across an addressable space well beyond the capabilities of typical electro-optical deflectors.

    "abstract": "           A novel hybrid method based on Mie theory and the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) was developed to study the microscopic parameters governing the optical response of tunable photonic crystals (PC). The method is based on a two-step process. An effective polarizability derived from Mie theory is determined by equating the extinction efficiency of an isolated nanoparticle (NP) to the extinction efficiency of an equivalent particle considering the dipolar limit. Then, this effective polarizability is used in the DDA framework to compute the optical response of an interacting particle array constituting the PC structure. As a particular example, the method was applied to a linear array of core-shell magnetite@silica NPs to study the dependence of extinction and absorption on system parameters such as core radius, shell thickness, total radius, interparticle separation, and size distribution. The results indicate that an increase in these parameters leads to a redshift of the extinction peak as well as an increase in its $FWHM$. Finally, the method is applied to fitting experimental results on reflection/transmission measurements of magnetite@silica NPs colloids subjected to different magnetic field strengths with very good agreement. The presented method reduces the computational cost and time for the NPs sizes considered, and can be applied to PCs responsive to different stimuli such as mechanical stress, electric field and temperature, \\textit{inter alia}.

    "abstract": "           Staging multiple laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs), each driven by its own laser pulse, is a promising technique for reaching higher particle energies than achievable in a single LPA. However, introducing subsequent laser pulses for post-acceleration in staged LPA geometries presents a significant challenge for conventional optics. Due to the focused, high-intensity nature of the laser beam interacting with the electron beam, the fluence on the coupling mirror surpasses the damage threshold of any solid-state optic. Replenishable plasma mirrors (PMs) offer a promising solution to this inherent restriction from high-energy pulses; however, they require a high stability and optical quality, and need to be produced at high repetition rates that match the needs to the staging experiment. Here, we investigate the properties of 4-octyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) liquid crystal (LC) films, produced with our new \"windmill\" film formation device, for this application. We conduct this investigation by observing the reliability of film formation at high repetition rates, characterizing the reflected beam profile, and pointing stability as a function of temperature and film formation speed, including film flatness and surface quality, using low-power laser reflection measurements. Our measurements demonstrate that 8CB LC films exhibit unprecedented microscopic surface quality, crucial for preserving laser pulse properties upon reflection. We also show consistent film formation suitable for operation up to 0.5 Hz with great film to film angular stability. The results allow us to conclude that 8CB LC films hold significant potential as reliable and cost-effective PMs that are suitable for coupling LPA stages.         ",

    "abstract": "           To make useful connections with experimental measurements, correlated electronic structure theories must accurately predict chemical properties in addition to energies. We present a finite-difference based algorithm to compute first-order response properties with phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) that relies on a branching correlated sampling approach. Focusing on electric dipole moments, we show that mean-field trial wave functions are sufficient to obtain high accuracy relative to CCSD(T) and experimental measurements for a set of 21 molecules, ranging in size from 2 to 18 atoms in their equilibrium geometries. As with energies, the quality of predicted dipole moments can be systematically improved with the use of correlated trial wave functions, even (or especially) in strongly correlated regimes. We show that the challenges faced by low-order perturbation theories in predicting the dipole moment of hydrogen fluoride across its dissociation coordinate are overcome with ph-AFQMC when using relatively simple trials. The key advantage of our approach over those previously reported for ph-AFQMC is its scalability to large system sizes with a phaseless bias no worse than that of a typical ground-state energy calculation; we routinely converge dipole moments for systems with more than one thousand basis functions.

    "abstract": "           The successful operation of the future Electron-Ion Collider is contingent on maintaining high hadron beam polarization up to 275 GeV. The Hadron Storage Ring lattice, however, features a symmetry-breaking interaction region that excites strong, non-systematic spin resonances, posing a significant threat to polarization preservation. This paper systematically investigates two complementary strategies to ensure high polarization transmission. The first method involves optimizing the vertical betatron phase advance between Siberian snakes to orchestrate a cancellation of depolarizing kicks across the ring. We demonstrate through simulations that both dynamic and fixed-optics solutions based on this principle can successfully preserve polarization through the strongest resonances. The second, more powerful approach involves optimizing the snake rotation axes to suppress resonance driving terms at their source. We revisit established symmetric configurations, such as the Lee-Courant schemes, and introduce a novel, highly symmetric ``Doubly Lee-Courant\" (DLC) scheme, which enforces a local \\(\\pi\\) spin phase advance across every consecutive pair of snakes. Our analysis reveals a clear performance hierarchy, with the DLC configuration providing an exceptionally robust and energy-insensitive baseline for polarization preservation. We conclude that a hybrid strategy, using a DLC snake scheme as a symmetric foundation and betatron phase tuning for fine corrections, offers the most effective path forward for the EIC and future high-energy polarized beam facilities.

Nitrogen doping has demonstrated a substantial reduction in surface resistance losses, which improves the quality factor of the cavities. More recently, oxygen doping has emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating comparable reductions in surface resistance. In this study, we combine cavity measurements on \\SI{1.3}{GHz} niobium SRF cavities subjected to a range of nitrogen- and oxygen-based treatments with material characterizations performed on cavity cutouts processed under identical conditions. This approach allows us to quantitatively assess the contribution of each impurity to the reduction of surface resistance. We find that nitrogen is ten times more effective than oxygen in reducing surface resistance at \\SI{16}{MV/m}. We propose a model to explain this variation, suggesting that nitrogen more effectively traps hydrogen, thus suppressing the formation of niobium hydrides within the RF penetration layer and enabling an improved superconducting gap.

This is the case of the precipitation retrievals of the GPM Passive Microwave Imagery (GMI) on board the core satellite of the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) that uses the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF). Currently, no geometrical correction is applied to GMI retrievals of surface precipitation, creating a horizontal displacement (or parallax mismatching) between the reported surface and the corrected coordinates corresponding to the cloud structures intersecting the field of view. GPROF precipitation retrievals over the Continental United States are analyzed using the ground-validated Multi-Resolution Multi-Sensor (GV-MRMS) system data and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) temperature profiles. Results applying this parallax correction scheme show improvements in the overall retrieval accuracy of GPROF, mainly during the summer months, for every precipitation type, when the freezing level (FL) is relatively high. The development of this new parallax-correction algorithm for passive microwave radiometers will significantly improve the accuracy of remote sensing data by minimizing spatial distortions in atmospheric measurements, leading to more precise weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and environmental assessments.

Here, z-scan transmission measurements at 0.5 Terahertz (THz) were performed for dilute and concentrated lysozyme solutions. A giant nonlinear absorption coefficient was found for dilute lysozyme solutions that is ten times greater than previous studies. This giant nonlinear response stems from the high average THz power generated by the TELBE free electron laser source, which drives the formation of a persistent thermal lens. In contrast, concentrated lysozyme solutions did not demonstrate a nonlinear response, revealing that crowding annihilates the thermal lensing effect. These results indicates that the THz nonlinear transmission of aqueous proteins solutions depends on the amount of hydration water present, and opens to the door to understanding the nonlinear optical properties of biologically relevant systems.

This either necessitates additional hardware resources or amplifies the existing computational complexity. Moreover, the OCT images also suffer from speckle noise, due to systemic reliance on low coherence interferometry. We propose a streamlined and computationally efficient approach based on Deep-Learning (DL) which enables reconstructing speckle-reduced OCT images directly from the wavelength domain. For reconstruction, two encoder-decoder styled networks namely Spatial Domain Convolution Neural Network (SD-CNN) and Fourier Domain CNN (FD-CNN) are used sequentially. The SD-CNN exploits the highly degraded images obtained by Fourier transforming the domain fringes to reconstruct the deteriorated morphological structures along with suppression of unwanted noise. The FD-CNN leverages this output to enhance the image quality further by optimization in Fourier domain (FD). We quantitatively and visually demonstrate the efficacy of the method in obtaining high-quality OCT images. Furthermore, we illustrate the computational complexity reduction by harnessing the power of DL models.

To avoid complications related to the exact knowledge of the intra-cavity field, we develop a simple model that estimates the maximal possible interference effects for given laser and multi-pass cell parameters, thereby providing an upper bound for the resulting decrease in transition probability relative to the case where these effects are neglected. A numerical evaluation of this upper bound for muonic hydrogen shows that, under our experimental conditions, such effects can be safely neglected.

In the absence of disorder, the light-driven system exhibits a tall, narrow on-resonance efficiency peak (near unity for our parameters); dephasing lowers and narrows this peak without shifting its position. Off resonance, the efficiency shows environmentally assisted transport with a clear non-monotonic dependence on dephasing and a finite optimum. Under static disorder, two regimes emerge: photon--ring coupling and diagonal energetic disorder mix the drive into dark ring modes, activate dissipative channels, and depress efficiency over a detuning window, whereas intra-ring coupling disorder has a much smaller impact in the tested range; increasing the intra-ring coupling $g$ moves dark-mode crossings away from the operating detuning and restores near-peak performance.

Building on this approach, the present work integrates a Non-Reciprocal Polarization Dependent Phase Shifter (NRPPS) into the broadband RFOG configuration, called NRPPS-RFOG, enabling truly passive operation without the need for active modulation-demodulation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the coupling ratio and NRPPS phase shift critically influence both sensitivity and linearity. An additional NRPPS section extends the measurable angular rotation range, addressing limitations arising from long fiber loops. The proposed design combines compactness, high performance, and low complexity, offering a practical path toward navigation grade RFOGs. These results highlight the potential of passive NRPPS-RFOGs for cost-effective, high-precision rotational sensing in demanding applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           The present work develops a rigorous framework for collective dipole oscillations in dense dielectric media by extending the Lorentz oscillator model to include both quadratic (second order) and cubic (third order) nonlinear restoring forces. Dipole-dipole interactions are incorporated via the dyadic Greens function, leading to a nonlocal description of the medium. Starting from the generalised oscillator equation, the system is expressed in matrix form with an effective stiffness matrix. Using a harmonic steady state ansatz, nonlinear terms are approximated in the frequency domain. Diagonalisation provides collective normal modes, which serve as a basis for perturbative expansion zeroth order captures the linear response, while higher orders describe nonlinear corrections. The polarisation is expressed through corrected mode amplitudes, yielding an effective nonlinear nonlocal susceptibility kernel. Finally, the scalar Greens function formalism is applied to derive the structured output field. These approaches bridge microscopic dipole dynamics with macroscopic optical propagation, offering key insights into nonlinear light matter interaction and turbulence influenced field evolution.

    "abstract": "           The behavior of electromagnetic waves in media modulated in both time and space, extensively studied decades ago, has recently attracted renewed attention. In this work, we address a central question of this research: can light at an initial frequency $\\omega_{0}$ be amplified solely by pumping with a traveling wave of much lower frequency $\\omega_{p} \\ll \\omega_{0}$? In general, the bandwidth of the modulation-induced optical frequency-comb spectrum increases substantially when the phase velocity of the traveling wave, $v_{p}$, approaches the phase velocity of light, $v_{0}$. However, in realistic photonic waveguides, the resulting amplification remains negligible due to the unfeasible modulation strengths and waveguide parameters required. In contrast, we demonstrate that modulating an optical resonator with a traveling wave of frequency $\\omega_{p}$ and phase velocity $v_{p}$ much smaller than the frequency $\\omega_{0}$ and phase velocity $v_{0}$ of light can produce strong amplification. This effect is accompanied by conversion into multiple comb lines within a relatively narrow frequency band.         ",

    "abstract": "           The strong coupling between photons and phonons in polar materials gives rise to phonon-polaritons that encapsulate a wealth of physical information, offering crucial tools for the ultrafast terahertz sources and the topological engineering of terahertz light. However, it is still quite challenging to form and manipulate the terahertz phonon-polaritons under the ultrastrong coupling regime till now. In this work, we demonstrate the ultrastrong coupling between the phonon (at 0.95 THz) in a MaPbI<sub>3</sub> film and the metallic bound states in the continuum (BICs) in Au metasurfaces. The Rabi splitting can be continuously tuned from 28% to 48.4% of the phonon frequency by adjusting the parameters (size, shape and period) of Au metasurfaces, reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime. By introducing wavelet transform, the mode evolution information of the terahertz phonon-polariton is successfully extracted. It indicates that the phonon radiation intensity of the MaPbI<sub>3</sub> film is enhanced as the coupling strength is increased. This work not only establishes a new platform for terahertz devices but also opens new avenues for exploring the intricate dynamics of terahertz phonon-polaritons.         ",

    "abstract": "           Low Gain Avalanche Diodes, also known as LGADs, are widely considered for fast-timing applications in high energy physics, nuclear physics, space science, medical imaging, and precision measurements of rare processes. Such devices are silicon-based and feature an intrinsic gain due to a $p{^+}$-doped layer that allows the production of a controlled avalanche of carriers, with multiplication on the order of 10-100. This technology can provide time resolution on the order of 20-30 ps, and variants of this technology can provide precision tracking too. The characterization of LGAD performance has so far primarily been focused on the interaction of minimum ionizing particles for high energy and nuclear physics applications. This article expands the study of LGAD performance to highly-ionizing particles, such as 28-MeV protons, which are relevant for several future scientific applications, e.g. in biology and medical physics, among others. These studies were performed with a beam of 28-MeV protons from a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beta particles from a $^{90}{\\rm Sr}$ source; these were used to characterize the response and the gain of an LGAD as a function of bias voltage and collected charge. The experimental results are also compared to TCAD simulations.         ",

Methods for integrating them into macroscopic structures that improve their sensitivity and enable their large-scale deployment are highly sought after. Here, we demonstrate cavity-enhanced photoluminescence (PL) of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) and hBN nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in polymer-based thin-film optical cavities on the centimeter scale. The cavity resonances efficiently modulate the spectral PL peak position of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in FNDs across the NV PL spectrum and lead to an up to 2.9-fold Purcell-enhancement of the NV PL decay rate. The brightness of hBN NPs increases by up to a factor of three and the PL decay rate is enhanced by up to 13-fold inside the cavities. Finally, we find a 4.8 times improved magnetic field sensitivity of 20 nm FNDs in thin-film cavities due to cavity-enhanced optically detected magnetic resonance contrast and PL brightness. Our study demonstrates a low-cost and scalable method for the fabrication of quantum sensor-doped thin-film cavities, which is an important step toward the development of advanced quantum sensing technologies.

    "abstract": "           The coffee-ring effect is a universal feature of evaporating sessile droplets with pinned contact line, wherein solutes or particles are advected to the droplet's edge due to evaporation-driven flows. While existing models have successfully described this phenomenon in particle-laden droplets, they often assume that hydrodynamics are decoupled from solute transport. This assumption breaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where the solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here, we investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt, and a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe the formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water evaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence on ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models cannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is governed by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation rate. To account for this, we develop a minimal theoretical model based on the lubrication approximation, incorporating the coupling between hydrodynamics and solute transport through the evaporation rate. Our framework reproduces key features of the experimental observations and suggests a physical basis for the $H_r$-dependent stability and infectivity of respiratory droplets containing viruses.

    "abstract": "           We demonstrate first experimental investigation on the performance of a single-node reservoir computer based on a silicon microring resonator (MRR) operating on the digit recognition task. The input layer of the reservoir is composed of a single laser, a Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulator, which encodes intensity of the light applied to the MRR input. The input signal is transformed into a virtual high-dimensional space through thermal nonlinearity in the MRR. The MRR response is recorded with readout network consisting of a photodetector and an oscilloscope. To study the principle of operation we measure nonlinear frequency response as well as dynamic response of the MRR. The resonator demonstrates a negative shift of the resonance frequency with an increase in input power due to the dominating thermo-optic effect. In addition to the frequency shift, the MRR transmission coefficient grows at the red side of the resonance. This effect underlies the nonlinear transient dynamics at the MRR output and provides an intrinsic fading memory that are the basis for the implementation of a reservoir computer. Here a silicon MRR serves as a single nonlinear physical node. We give proof of concept demonstrations of the developed reservoir architecture by solving the classification task. The performance characteristics is evaluated with the short-term memory and the parity-check tests. Obtained results pave the way to chip-scale optical reservoirs computing.         ",

Postselected quantum metrology with pure states has been significantly advanced recently. However, extending this framework to mixed states leads to formidable challenges, such as the difficulty in searching for lossless postselection measurements or even the loss of metrological information. In this work, we leverage the intuition for the lossless postselection of pure states and generalize the theory to the lossless postselection of a class of mixed states, dubbed quasi-pure states. We illustrate our findings in postselected quantum imaging, unitary estimation problems, and show that the quasi-pure structure can be universally engineered through only classical correlation with an ancilla. Our findings extend the utility of postselection techniques to scenarios with decoherence and also offer new perspectives to foundational questions in quantum information geometry.         ",

Here, we address this question in the context of polaritonic spectra, and report an intriguing new feature: the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the primary resonant polariton splitting, originating from vacuum field fluctuations. We show that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule limit under permutationally symmetrical initial-state constraint and that it follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary polariton splitting. This establishes a novel mechanism by which a quantum feature (the twin-polariton) can be tuned through a classical one (the primary polariton), offering new opportunities to probe and control the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.
