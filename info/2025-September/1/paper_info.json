    "abstract": "           The interaction between relativistic electron beams and intense laser fields has been extensively studied for generating high-energy radiation. However, achieving coherent radiation from such interactions needs to precisely control the phase matching of the radiationg electrons, which has proven to be exceptionally challenging. In this study, we demonstrate that coherent attosecond radiation can be produced when a laser pulse interacts at grazing angle with a relativistic electron beam. The electrons oscillate in the laser field and are modulated with a superluminal phase, coherent ultrashort pulse trains are produced in the far field at the Cherenkov angle. This is verified by theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, including three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and far-field time-domain radiation simulations. Based on our proposed scheme, high-repetition-rate, compact, and high-energy attosecond pulse sources are feasible.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum computing introduces abstract concepts and non-intuitive behaviors that can be challenging for students to grasp through traditional lecture-based instruction alone. This paper demonstrates how Project-Based Learning (PBL) can be leveraged to bridge that gap. This can be done by engaging students in a real-world, interdisciplinary task that combines quantum computing with their field of interest. As part of a similar assignment, we investigated the application of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction and benchmarked its performance against the classical Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). Through implementing and analyzing both methods on a small-scale problem, we gained practical experience with quantum algorithms, critically evaluated their limitations, and developed technical writing and research skills. The experience demonstrated that Project-Based Learning not only enhances conceptual understanding but also encourages students to engage deeply with emerging technologies through research, implementation, and reflection. We recommend the integration of similar PBL modules in introductory quantum computing courses. The assignment also works better if students are required to write and submit a conference-style paper, supported by mentorship from faculty across the different fields. In such course interdisciplinary, real-world problems can transform abstract theory into meaningful learning experiences and better prepare students for future advancements in quantum technologies.

Nonlinear upconversion, which converts infrared light into the visible band, offers a promising pathway to address these challenges. Here, we demonstrate high-efficiency infrared upconversion imaging using nonlinear silicon metasurfaces.

By tracking the density wave amplitude, we partition the dynamical evolution into four distinct stages and verify the pattern changes of each stage in both real and momentum space. The spatial symmetry of the patterns is intimately tied to the modulation amplitudes and frequencies. Consequently, appropriately reducing the modulation frequency and increasing the amplitude will facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Most notably, at specific parameters, a twelve-fold (D12) moire quasicrystal pattern emerges which closely resembles that observed in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space patterns likewise exhibit pronounced rotational symmetry, with those in real space showing good agreement at specific instants. The patterns obtained exhibit remarkable sensitivity to the modulation frequency, suggesting that this frequency-dependent pattern formation could be exploited for quantum precision measurement.

Although system size grows exponentially with the number of spins, our approach exploits the low-rank structure of the density matrix and the sparsity of Hamiltonians to avoid full matrix computations. By representing density matrices via low-rank factors and applying Krylov subspace methods for partial eigendecompositions, we reduce the per-step complexity of Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth schemes from $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(r^2N)$, where $N = 2^n$ is the Hilbert space dimension for $n$ spins and $r \\ll N$ the effective rank. Similarly, memory costs shrink from $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(rN)$, since no full $N\\times N$ matrices are formed. A key advance is handling the invariant subspace of zero eigenvalues. By using Householder reflectors built for the dominant eigenspace, we perform the solution entirely without large matrices. For example, a time step of a twenty-spin system, with density matrix size over one million, now takes only seconds on a standard laptop. Both Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth methods are reformulated to preserve physical properties of the density matrix throughout evolution. This low-rank algorithm enables simulations of much larger spin systems, which were previously infeasible, providing a powerful tool for comparing q-LL and q-LLG dynamics, testing each model validity, and probing how quantum features such as correlations and entanglement evolve across different regimes of system size and damping.

To address this challenge, we extend our recently developed deep-learning-based SALI model (Signal-to-image ArtificiaL Intelligence) by introducing the surrogate information gain (SIG) to optimize the selection of data points in the measurements. This approach significantly reduces time requirements in experiments while preserving accuracy in nuclear spin detection. The SIG is a figure of merit based on the expected variance of the signal, which is more straightforward to compute than the expected information gain rooted in Bayesian estimation. We demonstrate our approach on a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond coupled to $^{13}$C nuclei. In the high-field regime, our variance-based optimization is validated with experimental data, resulting in an 85$\\%$ reduction in measurement time for a modest reduction in performance. This work also constitutes the first validation of SALI on experimental data. In the low-field regime, we explore its performance on simulated data, predicting a 60$\\%$ reduction in the total experiment time by improving the temporal resolution of the measurements and applying SIG. This demonstrates the potential of integrating deep learning with optimized signal selection to enhance the efficiency of quantum sensing and nuclear spin characterization, paving the way for scaling these techniques to larger nuclear spin systems.

In this paper, we analyze the (deflection angle-independent) natural frequency dependency of MMR sensors on the rotor-stator distance, and evaluate the performance of theoretical models. The three presented sensors incorporate magnets of spherical and/or cylindrical geometry and can be operated at adjustable frequencies within the range of 61.9-307.3 Hz. Our proposed method to obtain the natural frequency demonstrates notable robustness to variations in the initial deflection amplitudes and quality factors resulting in statistical errors on the mean smaller than 0.05 %. We find that the distance-frequency relationship is well described by an adapted dipole model accounting for material and manufacturing uncertainties. Their combined effect can be compensated by an adjustment of a single parameter which drives the median model deviation generally below 0.2 %. Our depicted methods and results are important for the design and calibration process of new sensor types utilizing the MMR technique.         ",

    "abstract": "           The diode-pumped Nd: Vanadate laser is one of the most widely used lasers in the near-infrared range. Using passive Q-switching with a Cr:YAG saturable absorber (SA), it generates nanosecond pulses at tens of kilohertz. It is well known to display either regular pulsing or low-dimensional deterministic chaos, depending on the absorber's position within the cavity. However, to our knowledge, a strange nonchaotic attractor (SNA) has never been reported in this system. Our experiments provide the first evidence that, for a specific absorber position, the laser dynamics correspond to a strange nonchaotic attractor. SNAs exhibit complex dynamical behavior that is neither periodic nor chaotic, positioning them as a valuable resource for applications requiring high spectral diversity while preserving predictable dynamics. By experimentally obtaining time series of two laser variables, we reconstruct the underlying attractor. For a certain position of the SA, we find that all Lyapunov exponents are negative and that the energy spectra exhibit a broad frequency range, indicating that the attractor is nonchaotic and lacks periodicity. Using Higuchi's method, we estimate the fractal dimension (df) and find that 13 percent of the nonchaotic time series exhibit a well-defined df, confirming the presence of an SNA.         ",

    "abstract": "           This report presents a theoretical demonstration of a novel bistable quartic soliton (BQS) in saturable nonlinear media, specifically within a realistic dispersion-engineered ridge waveguide made of Lithium Niobate LiNbO3 . The study employs the variational method to establish the amplitude-width relationship, indicating the coexistence of stable solitons with the same duration but differing amplitudes. The impact of shock on the bistable soliton is examined through perturbative variational analysis, supported by numerical results. Additionally, we examine the interaction of BQS in different regimes and analyze the formation of the bound state. The robustness of the BQS under perturbations is further investigated via linear stability analysis.         ",

    "title": "Lie algebraic invariants in quantum linear optics",
    "abstract": "           Quantum linear optics without post-selection is not powerful enough to produce any quantum state from a given input state. This limits its utility since some applications require entangled resources that are difficult to prepare. Thus, we need a deeper understanding of linear optical state preparation. In this work, we give a recipe to derive conserved quantities in the evolution of arbitrary states along any possible passive linear interferometer. One example of such an invariant is the projection of a density operator onto the Lie algebra of passive linear optical Hamiltonians. These invariants give necessary conditions for exact state preparation: if the input and output states have different invariants, it is impossible to design a passive linear interferometer that evolves one into the other. Moreover, we provide a lower bound to the distance between an output and target state based on the distance between their invariants. This gives a necessary condition for approximate or heralded state preparations. Therefore, the invariants allow us to narrow the search when trying to prepare useful entangled states, like NOON states, from easy-to-prepare states, like Fock states. We conclude that future exact and approximate state preparation methods will need to consider the necessary conditions given by our invariants to weed out impossible linear optical evolutions.

    "abstract": "           High-precision optical frequency measurement is indispensable to modern science and technology, yet conventional spectroscopic techniques struggle to resolve sub-linewidth spectral features. We introduce a unique platform for super-resolving frequency estimation utilizing a mode-selective atomic Raman quantum memory implemented in warm cesium vapor. By precisely engineering the light matter interaction, our memory coherently stores the optimal temporal mode with high fidelity and retrieves it on-demand, realizing a mode crosstalk as low as 0.34%. To estimate the separation between two spectral lines, we experimentally measure the mean squared error of the frequency estimate, achieving a sensitivity of 1/20 of the linewidth with a ($34\\pm4$)-fold enhancement in precision over direct intensity measurements. This enhanced frequency resolution, combined with the memory's on-demand storage, retrieval, and mode conversion capabilities, paves the way for multifunctional memory-based time-frequency sensors and their integration within quantum networks.
