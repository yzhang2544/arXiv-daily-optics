    "title": "Fast Electromagnetic and RF Circuit Co-Simulation for Passive Resonator Field Calculation and Optimization in MRI",
    "abstract": "           Passive resonators have been widely used in MRI to manipulate RF field distributions. However, optimizing these structures using full-wave electromagnetic simulations is computationally prohibitive, particularly for large passive resonator arrays with many degrees of freedom. This work presents a co-simulation framework tailored specifically for the analysis and optimization of passive resonators. The framework performs a single full-wave electromagnetic simulation in which the resonator's lumped components are replaced by ports, followed by circuit-level computations to evaluate arbitrary capacitor and inductor configurations. This allows integration with a genetic algorithm to rapidly optimize resonator parameters and enhance the B1 field in a targeted region of interest (ROI). We validated the method in three scenarios: (1) a single-loop passive resonator on a spherical phantom, (2) a two-loop array on a cylindrical phantom, and (3) a two-loop array on a human head model. In all cases, the co-simulation results showed excellent agreement with full-wave simulations, with relative errors below 1%. The genetic-algorithm-driven optimization, involving tens of thousands of capacitor combinations, completed in under 5 minutes, whereas equivalent full-wave EM sweeps would require an impractically long computation time. This work extends co-simulation methodology to passive resonator design for first time, enabling the fast, accurate, and scalable optimization. The approach significantly reduces computational burden while preserving full-wave accuracy, making it a powerful tool for passive RF structure development in MRI.         ",

We describe a new $^{3}$He-$^{21}$Ne Ramsey comagnetometer operating with an in-situ $^{87}$Rb magnetometer for initialization and sensing of nuclear spins. During free precession of nuclear spins we turn off all lasers and introduce a microwave field to suppress back-action from Rb atoms. We demonstrate that scalar and dipolar interactions between nuclear spins can be eliminated via control of the polarized sample geometry. These improvements result in a bias-free measurement with a frequency sensitivity of 0.6 nHz after 6 hours of integration.         ",

    "abstract": "           Developments in ultrastable lasers have fueled remarkable advances in optical frequency metrology and quantum science. A key ingredient in further improving laser frequency stability is the use of low-noise mirror materials such as AlGaAs crystalline coatings. However, excess noise observed with these coatings limits the performance of cryogenic silicon cavities with AlGaAs mirrors to similar levels achieved with conventional dielectric coatings. With a new pair of crystalline coated mirrors in a 6-cm-long cryogenic silicon cavity operated at 17 K, we demonstrate a clear advantage of crystalline coatings over dielectric coatings. The achieved fractional frequency stability of $2.5 \\times 10^{-17}$ at 10 s is four times better than expected for dielectric mirrors and corresponds to more than tenfold reduction in the coating mechanical loss factor. We also combine two silicon cavities to demonstrate optical frequency averaging for enhanced stability. In addition, we present a long-term frequency drift record of four cryogenic silicon cavities measured over several years. These results open up realistic prospects for cavity-stabilized lasers with $10^{-18}$ fractional stability, as well as an all-optical timescale with continuously operating optical local oscillators.

Within selected configuration interaction, we introduce a new approach to the calculation of spectra that is complementary to eigenstate enumeration. In the new approach, we calculate the spectrum using the response-vector method, and the system of linear equations is solved using a basis of configurations that are optimally selected at each frequency of interest. We compare our spectra to previous studies, and highlight limitations of the local monomer approximation.

    "abstract": "           High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a highly nonlinear optical process that typically requires an intense laser to trigger emissions at integer multiples of the driving field frequency. Since HHG is commonly used as a spectroscopic tool to probe material properties, it becomes impossible to extract information about a material without introducing distortions caused by the strong driving field. Recent advances in bright squeezed vacuum sources have allowed HHG to be driven by purely quantum fields alone. Our work focuses on controlling and tuning HHG emission using a weak classical driving field with energy 1000 times less than that used in conventional HHG experiments, perturbed by an even weaker quantum field, such as bright squeezed vacuum (BSV). Our technique opens new avenues for nonlinear spectroscopy of materials by minimizing issues such as laser-induced damage, distortions, and heating. Our results show that a BSV pulse, containing less than 0.5% of the driving laser energy, can serve as an optical dial for tuning nonlinear emission, electron dynamics, and ionization.         ",

    "abstract": "           The need for high-temperature piezoelectric microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) requires pushing piezoelectric platforms to their thermal limits. In harsh thermal environments, piezoelectric MEMS devices are expected to sustain severe damage because of material degradation and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatches between the functional layers and the carrier wafer. This paper investigates the thermal endurance of the suspended thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform by observing the structural integrity and performance of acoustic Lamb wave resonators after annealing rounds at increasing temperatures, with a focus on temperatures between 550 $^\\circ$C and 800 $^\\circ$C, with 50 $^\\circ$C temperature increments. Fundamental symmetric (S0) mode acoustic resonators are fabricated on 600 nm stoichiometric LN (sLN) with 40 nm thick platinum top electrodes and a thin titanium adhesion layer. After each annealing round, changes in the devices' resonant frequency and quality factor (\\emph{Q}) are quantitatively studied. The devices and material stack are further analyzed with resistivity structures, optical microscope images, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The results provide valuable insights into the design and material selection necessary to optimize the suspended thin-film LN platform for high temperatures. Understanding the thermal limit of the platform enables its use for sensors, actuators, resonators, and potentially other thin-film LN microsystems, e.g, photonics, electro-optical, and acousto-optical systems in harsh thermal environments.

    "abstract": "           Silicon is a promising anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to its exceptionally high specific capacity (3600 mAh g$^{-1}$), significantly exceeding that of conventional graphite. However, its practical application is hindered by substantial volume expansion (300-400%) during lithiation, leading to mechanical degradation and capacity fade. A graphite-coated silicon core-shell structure has been proposed to mitigate these issues by combining silicon's capacity with graphite's structural stability. Despite this, experimental studies have shown that the usable capacity of such composite electrodes can remain low, often below 40% at 1C, especially under high-rate cycling. In this work, we develop a physics-based electrochemical model to investigate the charge-discharge behaviour, rate limitations, and degradation mechanisms of silicon-graphite core-shell anodes. The model incorporates lithium transport, interfacial kinetics, evolving contact area due to silicon expansion, and a simplified cracking framework to capture loss of active material. Results are validated against key experimental trends and used to explore the effects of particle size, shell thickness, and charge protocol, offering insights into the design of more durable and efficient Si-based composite anodes.

These pulses are exchanged between the nodes to simulate the Doppler shifts observed from a changing optical path length. We can continuously scan the simulated velocity from 14 to 620 m/s while simultaneously measuring velocity-dependent clock shifts at much higher velocities than has been previously recorded. This system provides an effective testbed that allows us to explore issues and solutions to enable femtosecond-level optical time transfer at high velocity.         ",

A finite-element model with {\\it in situ}-validated, spatially-resolved chamber emissivity reduced blackbody radiation shift uncertainty to $6.3\\times 10^{-19}$. Concurrently, an externally mounted lattice cavity combined with a larger beam waist suppressed density shifts. Enhanced lattice depth modulation consolidated lattice light shift uncertainty to $6.3\\times 10^{-19}$ by enabling simultaneous determination of key polarizabilities and magic wavelength. Magnetic shifts were resolved below $10^{-18}$ via precision characterization of the second-order Zeeman coefficient. Supported by a crystalline-coated ultra-low-expansion cavity-stabilized laser and refined temperature control suppressing BBR fluctuations, the clock also achieves a frequency stability better than $1\\times10^{-18}$ at 30,000-s averaging time.

    "abstract": "           The reliability of bump connection structures has become a critical aspect of future silicon detectors for particle physics. The High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD) for the ATLAS experiment at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider will require 8032 hybrid pixel sensor modules, composed of two Low Gain Avalanche Diode sensors bump-bonded to two readout ASICs and glued to a passive PCB. The detector will operate at low temperature (-30 degrees Celsius) to mitigate the impact of irradiation. The thermomechanical reliability of flip-chip bump connections in HGTD modules is a critical concern, particularly due to their characteristically lower bump density (pixel pitch dimensions of 1.3 mm by 1.3 mm). This paper elaborates on the challenges arising from this design characteristic. Finite element analysis and experimental testing were employed to investigate failure modes in the flip-chip bump structures under thermal cycling from -45 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius and to guide the module redesign. The optimized design demonstrates significantly enhanced robustness and is projected to fulfill the full lifetime requirements of the HGTD.         ",

A prerequisite for such experiments is the capability to trap nanorotors and initialize them in a quantum ground state of libration. Here, we demonstrate the reliable, repetitive laser-induced loading of silica nanodimers and trimers into an optical tweezer.

In this study, we employ single-photon interferometry to overcome the experimental challenge of precise phase control in quantum systems, thereby enabling a complete simulation of the non-Hermitian EP ring in three-dimensional parameter space without invoking any additional symmetry assumptions. By measuring the non-Hermitian dynamics in three-dimensional parameter space, we determine the system's eigenstates, which allows us to characterize the topological band structure of the system under different conditions. We describe the topological properties of the EP ring by extracting the Chern number and Berry phase for different parameter manifolds and observe the topological critical phenomena of the system.

    "abstract": "           The square inverse law with distance plays an important role in many fields of physics covering electromagnetism, optics or acoustics. However, as every law in physics has its range of validity. We propose an open-inquiry laboratory where we challenge these concepts by proposing experiments where the intensity of light decays linearly or even remains constant over a range of distances. Using the light sensors built into smartphones, it is possible to measure light curves for different sources: point, linear, planar and even LED ring lights. The analysis of these curves allows us to discuss the limits of the physical theories. This low-cost laboratory, initially proposed in the context of the COVID19 pandemic, has the virtue of challenging intuition and encouraging the critical spirit of the students.         ",

The pursuit of electromagnetic cloaking significantly advanced the field of metamaterials, yet achieving broadband, conformal cloaking for complex, non-trivial objects remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we introduce the concept of 'tailor-made metasurfaces' - machine-designed aperiodic structures optimized to suppress scattering from arbitrary objects by accounting for their layout, including resonant or large-scale features. Specifically, we demonstrated a wideband ~20% fractional bandwidth scattering suppression of more than 20-30 dB for various generic test objects, including randomly distributed wire meshes, spheres, and polygons. The demonstrated evolutionary optimization marks a leap forward in electromagnetic design, enabling the development of high-performance structures to meet complex technological demands.         ",

    "abstract": "           We have investigated strong-field-induced electronic coherences in argon and molecular nitrogen ions created by high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses. This is a step toward the long-sought goal of strong-field coherent control in molecular chemistry. We employed high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses in a pump-probe setup to investigate a recent prediction that electronic coherences in nitrogen molecules change the ion yields vs. pump-probe delay. [Yuen and Lin, Phys. Rev. A 109, L011101 (2024)]. The predicted coherence signals in molecular nitrogen could not be resolved above the optical interference of the pump and probe pulses; a simultaneous measurement clearly resolved the induced cation fine-structure coherence in strong-field-ionized argon. The results of our comparison with simulations suggest that optical interference effects manifest differently in each ionic species and must be carefully accounted for when interpreting experimental data. We found that nonsequential double ionization in the low-intensity region of the focal volume can reduce the visibility of coherence generated by two-pulse sequential ionization, and we quantify the importance of pulse shape and spectral characteristics for isolating the desired coherence signals.

    "abstract": "           Precision atomic and quantum experiments rely on ultra-stable narrow linewidth lasers constructed using table-top ultra-low expansion reference cavities. These experiments often require multiple lasers, operating at different wavelengths, to perform key steps used in state preparation and measurement required in quantum sensing and computing. This is traditionally achieved by disciplining a cavity-stabilized laser to a key atomic transition and then transferring the transition linewidth and stability to other lasers using the same reference cavity in combination with bulk-optic frequency shifting such as acousto-optic modulators. Transitioning such capabilities to a low cost photonic-integrated platform will enable a wide range of portable, low power, scalable quantum experiments and applications. Yet, today's bulk optic approaches pose challenges related to lack of cavity tunability, large free spectral range, and limited photonic integration potential. Here, we address these challenges with demonstration of an agile photonic-integrated 780 nm ultra-high-Q tunable silicon nitride reference cavity that performs multiple critical experimental steps including laser linewidth narrowing, high resolution rubidium spectroscopy, dual-stage stabilization to a rubidium transition, and stability transfer to other lasers. We achieve up to 20 dB of frequency noise reduction at 10 kHz offset, precision spectroscopy over a 250 MHz range, and dual-stage locking to rubidium with an Allan deviation of $8.5 \\times 10^{-12}$ at 1 s and up to 40 dB reduction at 100 Hz. We further demonstrate the transfer of this atomic stability to a second laser, via the rubidium-disciplined cavity, and demonstrate multi-wavelength Rydberg electrometry quantum sensing. These results pave the path for integrated, compact, and scalable solutions for quantum sensing, computing and other atomic and trapped ion applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           Laser-induced damage is a serious challenge for optical components; therefore, determining the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) is a crucial step in the manufacturing process. In many cases, such as for space applications, it is also necessary to account for the vacuum environment. Since conventional damage detection methods face limitations under vacuum conditions, an alternative approach is required. This article introduces a He-Ne laser imaging system designed for in-situ damage detection within a LIDT station. The system enables fourfold magnification imaging of the test sample and its surroundings without placing imaging optics inside the vacuum chamber, thereby preserving the cleanliness of the chamber. The detection method can be applied to both transparent and opaque samples; in transparent optics, damage is observable from either side. To verify the system's functionality, two sample types were investigated: a silica wafer (non-transparent for He-Ne radiation) and a commonly used dielectric mirror for 1030 nm (transparent for He-Ne radiation). Particular attention was devoted to determining the minimum damage size that can be reliably recognized. The system successfully distinguished damage features as small as 35 ${\\mu}$m.         ",

An 800 nm AlScN thin film with 40% scandium alloying concentration was deposited on a thick sapphire substrate to achieve strong acoustic energy confinement and large electromechanical coupling effect, thereby minimizing the insertion loss (IL) and propagation loss (PL) of the acoustic delay line (ADL). The proposed ADL was designed to operate in the Sezawa mode using a Single-Phase Unidirectional Transducer (SPUDT) electrode configuration for better unidirectionality. The fabricated ADLs with different delay lengths, after conjugate matching, exhibited delay times spanning 13 to 214 ns and IL ranging from 7.6 to 18.3 dB. The extracted PL reached as low as 9.2 dB/mm at 5.9 GHz, with a group velocity (v_g) of around 5,779 m/s. Based on these results, the proposed ADLs exhibit a high acoustic propagation Q-factor of 3,044. These findings highlight the potential of AlScN-on-sapphire platforms for high operational frequency, low-loss SAW ADL devices in advanced RF applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           Photons, unlike electrons, do not couple directly to magnetic fields, yet synthetic gauge fields can impart magnetic-like responses and enable topological transport. Discretized Floquet evolution provides a controlled route, where the time-ordered sequencing of non-commuting Hamiltonians imprints complex hopping phases and breaks time-reversal symmetry. However, stabilizing such driven dynamics and observing unambiguous topological signatures on a reconfigurable platform has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate synthetic gauge fields for light on a programmable photonic processor by implementing discretized Floquet drives that combine static and dynamic phases. This approach reveals hallmark features of topological transport: chiral circulation that reverses under drive inversion, flux-controlled interference with high visibility, and robust directional flow stabilized by maximizing the minimal Floquet quasi-energy gap. The dynamics are further characterized by a first-harmonic phase order parameter, whose per-period winding number quantifies angular drift and reverses sign with the drive order. These results establish discretized, gap-optimized Floquet evolution as a versatile and fully programmable framework for topological photonics, providing a compact route to engineer gauge fields, stabilize driven phases, and probe winding-number signatures of chiral transport.

A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated.
