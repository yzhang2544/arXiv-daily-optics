    "title": "Light in Slices: How to Enable Precise Laser Processing?",
    "abstract": "           Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling, from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence, the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids. We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.         ",

    "abstract": "           High power lasers are used for a variety of manufacturing processes on time and length scales that cover many orders of magnitude and on different materials. The variety of processes achievable through laser-material interaction results from numerous coupled, nonlinear physical phenomena. Simulation models can be used to gain process understanding, explain experimentally observed phenomena, and optimize or design processes. However, the inherent complexity and diversity of the phenomena make modeling a challenging task. Within this chapter, a universal model is presented that accurately simulates a broad spectrum of processes, including welding, additive manufacturing, cutting, ablation, drilling, and surface structuring, encompassing both continuous wave and ultrashort pulsed lasers and their interaction with various materials. Starting from the fundamental principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, a continuum mechanical framework is introduced that captures the main multiphysical effects. A numerical solution using the Finite Volume Method is presented and validated against benchmark problems where detailed experimental data are available. Macroscopic examples with continuous wave lasers include keyhole drilling and collapse under stationary illumination as well as melt pool dynamics and pore formation in copper welding. At the microscopic level, copper ablation with femtosecond pulses is simulated. Finally, a set of real-world applications is shown, where the model helps to explain and optimize industrial phenomena and defects. Examples include deep penetration welding of steel with dynamic beam shaping, multilayer additive manufacturing via powder bed fusion, and ultrashort pulsed drilling of micro vias in dielectric materials.

An electron born into one of those states is temporarily delayed near the atomic core by the combined atomic and laser potential, leading to fast changes in the phase delay with energy for photoelectrons in these vortex states.

We derive the dispersion relation for the corresponding mathematical description, a reduced Vlasov--Maxwell system, by extending the well-known Penrose condition. It is observed that, under very mild assumptions, the dispersion relation decouples into two parts. The first part is identical to the classic Penrose condition for the Vlasov--Poisson system, while the second part describes the influence of the laser on the transverse dynamics (e.g. a Weibel instability). In particular, this means that the longitudinal dynamics (e.g. a two-stream instability) can not be stabilized in this manner as far as linear theory is concerned. We show, however, that nonlinear effects can be used to couple the two parts and achieve effective control. This is done by determining the control parameters (i.e. the form of the external electric and magnetic fields) by solving a PDE-constrained optimization problem.         ",

    "abstract": "           Metasurfaces have emerged as a powerful platform to control free-space light at the subwavelength scale, enabling applications in sensing, lasing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photonics. However, their practical deployment is hindered by two key limitations: a tradeoff between low-Q resonances and weak amplitude contrast, and their predominantly static nature allowing only passive functionalities. These challenges are further aggravated in the application-relevant mid-infrared (mid-IR) range, where the lack of suitable low-loss materials and the strong absorption of common substrates such as silicon oxide or sapphire severely constrain performance and scalability. Here, we address these issues with actively tunable single-crystalline silicon membrane metasurfaces that combine high-Q resonances, strong amplitude contrast, and wafer-scale fabrication compatible dimensions for high throughput manufacturing. Our platform achieves record-high measured Q-factors up to 3000 in the mid-IR spectrum, supporting efficient dynamic modulation through two distinct schemes: (i) on-chip electro-thermal tuning via Joule heating, sustaining 50% modulation depth at CMOS-compatible voltages and speeds up to 14.5 kHz, and (ii) ultrafast all-optical modulation via carrier generation in silicon, reaching nanosecond response times and estimated sub-GHz modulation rates. By uniting sharp resonances, strong contrast, large-scale manufacturability, and dynamic tunability, our active silicon membrane metasurfaces advance the frontier of mid-IR nanophotonics and open new opportunities in sensing, free-space communication, thermal radiation management, and quantum technologies.

This paper presents an investigation into combining these two noise control techniques, to achieve enhanced noise control over a spatial region using a hybrid device. In particular, conventional feedforward active noise control is combined with a labyrinthine metasurface and the increase in performance offered by the hybrid solution is demonstrated.         ",

    "abstract": "           A fully stabilized frequency comb is essential for precision metrology and coherent optical synthesis. However, fully-stabilized frequency combs generally require separate stages for supercontinuum generation (SCG) and self-referencing, largely limiting their compactness. Here, enabled by the low-threshold multi-octave supercontinuum generation and concurrent third-harmonic generation in low-loss silicon nitride waveguides, we present a novel approach to a self-referenced frequency comb source at 1 GHz repetition rate spanning from the full visible (VIS) to the mid-infrared (MIR). Our coherent comb is seeded by an all-polarization-maintaining ultrafast fiber laser at 1556 nm, with a pulse duration of 73 fs at 1 GHz repetition rate. With an injected energy of merely 110 pJ, the pulses propagate through dispersion-engineered Si3N4 waveguides, generating supercontinuum spanning over three octaves from 350-3280 nm i.e. 0.76 PHz of coherent bandwidth. Moreover, the on-chip third harmonic generation provides a carrier envelope offset beat note via f-3f with a signal-to-noise ratio of 43 dB. Fueled by the evolving photonic integration providing possibilities of on-chip filtering and photo-detectors, this approach for single-chip self-referencing of high-repetition-rate frequency combs paves the way for ultrabroadband comb sources with unprecedented compactness and field-readiness.

    "abstract": "           The rising demand for AI training and inference, as well as scientific computing, combined with stringent latency and energy budgets, is driving the adoption of integrated photonics for computing, sensing, and communications. As active photonic integrated circuits (PICs) scale in device count and functional heterogeneity, physical implementation by manual scripting and ad-hoc edits is no longer tenable. This creates an immediate need for an electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) stack in which physical design automation is a core capability. However, there is currently no end-to-end fully automated routing flow that coordinates photonic waveguides and on-chip metal interconnect. Critically, available digital VLSI and analog/custom routers are not directly applicable to PIC metal routing due to a lack of customization to handle constraints induced by photonic devices and waveguides. We present, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end routing framework for large-scale active PICs that jointly addresses waveguides and metal wires within a unified flow. We introduce a physically-aware global planner that generates congestion- and crossing-aware routing guides while explicitly accounting for the placement of photonic components and waveguides. We further propose a sequence-consistent track assignment and a soft guidance-assisted detailed routing to speed up the routing process with significantly optimized routability and via usage. Evaluated on various large PIC designs, our router delivers fast, high-quality active PIC routing solutions with fewer vias, lower congestion, and competitive runtime relative to manual and existing VLSI router baselines; on average it reduce via count by ~99%, user-specified design rule violation by ~98%, and runtime by 17x, establishing a practical foundation for EPDA at system scale.

    "abstract": "           We develop a general theory for twisted bilayer photonic crystals that takes into account both far-field response and near-field coupling. The theory is based on the framework of a generalized Rayleigh-Schr\u00f6dinger perturbation theory for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. A universal form for interlayer coupling is derived, which relates the hopping strength to the Fourier transforms of the Wannier functions in the single layer photonic crystal. For low energy states at the K point in hexagonal lattices, the interlayer coupling reduces to that in the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for graphene. As an example, we study a twisted bilayer photonic crystal slab with air holes arranged in a honeycomb lattice in each layer. The first order solution of our model predicts a four-fold band splitting in the far-field spectrum compared to the single-layer case, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, our theory reveals that for low energy states at K points, scattering towards the {\\Gamma} point via the moir\u00e9 potential is suppressed. Based on our theory, we propose a wide-angle, high-Q tunable flat band cavity by combining the bilayer at a large twist angle with a Brillouinzone-folding perturbation within each layer. The cavity behaves like a collection of quasi-bound states in the continuum with a divergent density of states, with potential applications in nonlinear optics, lasing and quantum optics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Silicon, despite its abundance and high energy density, remains underexplored as a carbon-free fuel, with limited data available on its combustion characteristics. In this work, the combustion behaviour of silicon particles is examined using an electrostatic levitator with laser ignition. Five oxidizing environments at atmospheric pressure are investigated: air, pure oxygen, and mixtures containing 40% oxygen (by mole) diluted with nitrogen, helium, or argon. The burning droplet peak temperature, measured by three-colour pyrometry, increases by 337 K from air to pure oxygen. The peak temperature of the silicon droplet in the 40%O2-60%He mixture is lower than that in the 40%O2-60%Ar mixture, in contradiction with thermodynamic predictions, due to a higher Lewis number of the helium-diluted mixture. Although oxygen diffusivity is higher in the helium-diluted mixture, a lower burning rate is observed, attributed to the lower combustion temperature. High-speed colour camera observations reveal that the square of the particle diameter decreases with time in each combustion run, following a strong linear relationship (R2 > 0.99) across all oxidizing environments. However, the combustion lifetime is proportional to the initial particle diameter to the power of n, with n ranging from 1.69 to 1.82. This deviation from the expected n = 2 appears to result from unavoidable measurement uncertainties and the limited particle size range, rather than differences in combustion physics. The decrease in silicon droplet size during combustion is attributed to the formation of gaseous SiO as an intermediate combustion product. The SiO species is observed using a UV camera, showing a UV intensity decay from the particle surface. High-speed imaging and LED absorption signals indicate that the final condensed product, SiO2 nanoparticles, are not optically visible, suggesting they possess very low emissivity.         ",

In this context, we present a comprehensive suite of tools and methods designed for wafer-scale biosensor prototyping that is sensitive, highly parallelizable, and manufacturable. A central component of our approach is a new initiative that allows for open-source multi-project wafers (MPW), giving all participants access to the designs submitted by others. We demonstrate that this strategy not only promotes design reuse but also facilitates advanced back-end-of-line (BEOL) fabrication techniques, improving the manufacturability and process yield of CMOS biosensors. Developing CMOS-based biosensors also involves the challenge of heterogeneous integration, which includes external electrical, mechanical, and fluid layers. We demonstrate simple modular designs that enable such integration for sample delivery and signal readout. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach in measuring the hybridization of DNA molecules by focusing on data acquisition and machine learning (ML) methods that leverage the parallelism of the sensors to enable robust classification of desirable analyte interactions.

    "abstract": "           Reaching lasing in electrically pumped microdevices based on solution-processed semiconductors poses a major scientific and technological challenge. Halide perovskites offer a promising platform for electrical injection, since their optically excited single-crystal cavities and predesigned or postprocessed microstructures have exhibited low lasing threshold. Indirect electrical pumping of a dual-cavity perovskite laser was recently obtained, utilizing a well-established technological concept of embedding a high-luminosity light-emitting diode (LED) with a high-gain medium into an integrated device. Direct charge-carrier injection into a perovskite LED excited by auxiliary short-, optical-pulses resulted into amplified spontaneous emission. Other efforts for rational engineering of architectures that allow for high charge-carrier density are still to demonstrate lasing. Here, we develop a novel strategy for achieving direct electrical pumping of a perovskite laser. We integrate a solution-grown CsPbBr3 microplate with chemically inert single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes and embed them into an optical microcavity. By cooling the microdevice down to 8 K at a constant current, a perovskite p-i-n diode is formed that facilitates a balanced carrier injection at high current densities. The perovskite microcavity diode operates in the strong coupling regime, exhibiting polariton lasing under a direct current of 65 uA.         ",

It is also a fundamental issue of light-matter interactions. The rapid development of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) atomically-thin semiconductors brings excellent great chance to test and demonstrate some basic predictions by quantum optics theory in textbook, i.e., by the quantum Rabi model. Such test and demonstration are of both scientific and technological significance because of the quick emergence of the second quantum revolution. In this Letter, we show a quantum optics demonstration of the variable-temperature optical responses of the elementary excitations in few-layer WSe2 flakes. It is unraveled that the variable-temperature reflectance and fluorescence patterns of the elementary excitations (i.e., the band-edge excitons) of monolayer, bilayer and hBN capped WSe2 match well with the predictions by the quantum Rabi model under the rotating wave approximation. Decoherence times, Rabi frequencies, and transition matrix elements of the elementary excitations in these few-layer WSe2 flakes are found to be all negatively correlated with temperature, and to show dependence on layer number and capping layer. These findings may provide a novel perspective for comprehending the fundamental quantum physical properties of two-dimensional materials.         ",

We show that there are ``islands'' of instability within a stability range of energies which result from stochastic resonance between ``internal modes'' of soliton and quantum noise of the ``basin''. The transition to multiple-pulsing can be suppressed in a system driven by a comparatively low-power seed.

These atoms uniquely combine the strong dipole-dipole interactions typical of Rydberg states with long lifetimes. However, low-angular-momentum ($\\ell$) laser-accessible Rydberg levels have been so far mostly used, because circular Rydberg atoms have no optical transitions, hindering their individual detection and manipulation. We remove this limitation with a hybrid platform, combining an array of logical laser-trapped circular Rydberg atoms of rubidium with an auxiliary array of Rb ancilla atoms transiently excited to a low-$\\ell$ Rydberg level. We perform a quantum non-demolition detection of the logical qubit with the ancilla, through the blockade of the ancilla optical excitation induced by a F\u00f6rster resonance. Conversely, we locally manipulate the logical qubit through the excitation of the ancilla. This dual-Rydberg platform is highly promising for quantum computation and simulation. It adds to the circular-atom toolbox the mid-circuit measurements, essential for error correction. More strikingly, it gives access to time correlations in long-term quantum simulations, uniquely accessible to circular Rydberg atoms.         ",

    "abstract": "           Advances in integrated photonics have enabled unprecedented level of control of light, powering a wide range of photonic technologies from communications and computing to precision metrology and quantum information. However, the conventional on-chip optical signal processing approaches based on optical waveguides and cavities suffer from their large physical footprint and narrow operating bandwidth, respectively. To address this, we propose and experimentally demonstrate, using the thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonics, a modular, recursive optical signal processing framework. In our approach, fast electro-optic (EO) switch is used to either keep an optical packet inside the loop, with the processing element embedded within, or to release it from the loop and direct it towards the output waveguide. By configuring the switch on a timescale shorter than a time the photon spends traversing the loop, this architecture can achieve different optical pathlengths in a compact footprint without sacrificing optical bandwidth. As an example, we embed a phase-modulator (PM) inside the loop and demonstrate a frequency shift of optical packets up to 420 GHz, using only a 3 GHz sinusoidal microwave signal. By replacing the PM with chirped Bragg gratings (CBG), we demonstrate recursive delay line featuring large group delays of 28 ps/nm over a 30 nm optical bandwidth. Finally, by introducing asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer (AMZI) inside the loop, we demonstrate a reconfigurable differentiation of the optical packet in time, up to an unprecedented fifth-order. Our results establish a powerful and scalable platform for multifunctional photonic processing, setting the stage for next-generation integrated systems with ultrahigh reconfigurability and spectral-temporal versatility.

Such diffusion inverse problem solvers aim to sample from the posterior distribution of data given the measurements, using a combination of the unconditional score function and an approximation of the posterior related to the forward process. Recently, consistency models (CMs) have been proposed to directly predict the final output from any point on the diffusion ODE trajectory, enabling high-quality sampling in just a few NFEs. CMs have also been utilized for inverse problems, but existing CM-based solvers either require additional task-specific training or utilize data fidelity operations with slow convergence, not amenable to large-scale problems. In this work, we reinterpret CMs as proximal operators of a prior, enabling their integration into plug-and-play (PnP) frameworks. We propose a solver based on PnP-ADMM, which enables us to leverage the fast convergence of conjugate gradient method. We further accelerate this with noise injection and momentum, dubbed PnP-CM, and show it maintains the convergence properties of the baseline PnP-ADMM. We evaluate our approach on a variety of inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CM trained for MRI datasets. Our results show that PnP-CM achieves high-quality reconstructions in as few as 4 NFEs, and can produce meaningful results in 2 steps, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world inverse problems while outperforming comparable CM-based approaches.

Most existing techniques rely on secondary micro- and nanothermometers that require individual calibration of each sensor, ideally both off- and in-situ, before use. We present an alternative approach that overcomes this limitation by employing fluorescent diamonds containing silicon-vacancy centers, where the thermo-sensitive physical quantities are the centers' photoluminescence and the diamond host's Raman signals. The photoluminescence and Raman data are analyzed using two multi-feature regression algorithms that leverage a minimal number of calibration diamonds and temperature set points to predict the temperature of previously unseen diamonds. Using this approach, the models achieve accuracies as low as 0.7 K, resolutions down to 0.6 K Hz$^{-1/2}$, and sensitivity as high as 0.04 K$^{-1}$. These correspond to improvements of roughly 70 percent (over threefold) in accuracy, 50 percent (twofold) in resolution, and 567 percent (sevenfold) in sensitivity compared with traditional single-feature models. Our approach is particularly suited to applications where pre-deployment calibration of every thermosensor is impractical, and it is generalizable to any thermometry platform with two or more simultaneously measurable temperature-dependent observables.

CHRONOS combines a ring-cavity Sagnac interferometer with torsion-bar test masses to realize the first quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of angular momentum in a macroscopic system. By implementing a speed-meter readout in the rotational degree of freedom, CHRONOS coherently cancels quantum radiation-pressure noise and enables sub-Hz observations. We show that detuned power recycling and cavity-length optimization can simultaneously relax technical requirements on both torsion bars and speed meters. Assuming a realistic optical design with a 1m torsion bar, we estimate strain sensitivities of $h \\simeq 1 \\times 10^{-18}\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1Hz for detectors with arm lengths of 2.5m, 40m, and 300m.

They are particularly challenging due to ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries.

Learning-based approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for regular domains or focus on forward modeling. Here, we introduce {\\em GeoFunFlow}, a geometric diffusion model framework for inverse problems on complex geometries. GeoFunFlow combines a novel geometric function autoencoder (GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and produces continuous reconstructions of physical fields, while the diffusion model enables posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Across five benchmarks, GeoFunFlow achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy over complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and delivers efficient inference compared to operator-learning and diffusion model baselines.

    "abstract": "           Preparing magnon nonclassical states is a central topic in the study of quantum magnonics. Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.         ",

    "abstract": "           We investigate the nonrelativistic quantum dynamics of a spinless particle in a screw-type spacetime endowed with two independent twist controls that interpolate between a pure screw dislocation and a homogeneous twist. From the induced spatial metric we build the covariant Schr\u00f6dinger operator, separate variables to obtain a single radial eigenproblem, and include a uniform magnetic field and an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux by minimal coupling. Analytically, we identify a clean separation between a global, AB-like reindexing set by the screw parameter and a local, curvature-driven mixing generated by the distributed twist. We derive the continuity equation and closed expressions for the azimuthal and axial probability currents, establish practical parameter scalings, and recover limiting benchmarks (AB, Landau, and flat space). Numerically, a finite-difference Sturm-Liouville solver (with core excision near the axis and Langer transform) resolves spectra, wave functions, and currents. The results reveal AB periodicity and reindexing with the screw parameter, Landau-fan trends, twist-induced level tilts and avoided crossings, and a geometry-induced near-axis backflow of the axial current with negligible weight in cross-section integrals. The framework maps the geometry and fields directly onto measurable spectral shifts, interferometric phases, and persistent-current signals.         ",

    "abstract": "           Atomic sensors using light-matter interactions, in particular atomic clocks and atom interferometers, have the potential to complement optical gravitational-wave detectors in the mid-frequency regime. Although both rely on interference, the interfering components of clocks are spatially colocated, whereas atom interferometers are based on spatial superpositions. Both the electromagnetic fields that drive the transitions and generate superpositions, while propagating through spacetime, as well as the atoms themselves as massive particles are influenced by gravitational waves, leading to effective potentials that induce phase differences inferred by the sensor. In this work, we analyze the effects of these potentials on atomic clocks and atom interferometers in the laboratory frame. We show that spatial superpositions in atom interferometers, both light-pulse and guided ones, give rise to a gravitational-wave signal. Although these spatial superpositions are suppressed for clocks, we show that the light pulses driving internal transitions measure the spatial distance between the centers of two separate clocks. We highlight that this mechanism only yields a sensitivity if both clocks, including possible trapping setups, move on geodesics given by the gravitational wave. While such configurations are natural for satellite free-fliers, terrestrial optical clocks normally rely on stationary traps, rendering them insensitive to leading order. Moreover, we show that both sensors can be enhanced by composite interrogation protocols in a common framework. To this end, we propose a pulse sequence that can be used for large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers and for hyper-echo atomic clocks, leading to a signal enhancement and noise suppression.

    "abstract": "           Molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) is one of the key chemical species that controls and shapes a wide spectrum of astrophysical processes ranging from galaxy evolution to planet formation. Although the catalyzation on dust grain surfaces is considered as the dominant formation channel of H$_2$ in the interstellar medium (ISM), which could nonetheless suffer from the Boltzmann factor suppression at low temperatures. Here we demonstrate that quantum tunneling can dominate the H$_2$ formation process, effectively resolving the long-standing efficiency problem across a wide range of temperatures. By employing the path integral method in hybrid Monte Carlo simulations to account for nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), we quantitatively identify that the tunneling of hydrogen atoms maintains relatively stable efficiencies even at temperatures below 50 K on both graphitic and silicate grain surfaces. The potential barriers associated with chemisorption/desorption and two-H association, rather than diffusion and hopping, are the dominant factors governing the actual reaction efficiency at low temperatures. These findings provide a solid physical foundation for molecule formation, which historically relied on ad-hoc formation rate multipliers to explain observed rates. The quantitative rates also offer new methodologies for observational constraints on H$_2$ formation and destruction, thereby enabling more accurate astrophysical models and interpretations on interstellar molecular materials.

    "abstract": "           We report the discovery of super resonance--a new regime of resonant behavior in which a mode's out-of-phase response persists far beyond its classical bandwidth. This effect emerges from a coiled phononic structure composed of a locally resonant elastic metamaterial and architected to support multiple internal energy pathways. These pathways converge at a single structural location, enabling extended modal dominance and significantly broadening the frequency range over which a resonant phase is sustained. We demonstrate by direct numerical simulations the implications of this mechanism in the context of flow instability control, where current approaches are inherently constrained by the characteristically narrow spectral bandwidth of conventional resonances. Using a super-resonant phononic subsurface structure interfacing with a channel flow, we show passive simultaneous suppression of four unstable flow perturbations across a frequency range more than five times wider than that is achievable with a standard resonance in an equivalent uncoiled structure. By enabling broadband, passive control of flow instabilities, super resonance overcomes a longstanding limitation in laminar flow control strategies. More broadly, it introduces a powerful new tool for phase-engineered wave-matter interaction. The ability to preserve out-of-phase modal response across wide spectral ranges establishes a fundamental advance in the physics of resonance, with far-reaching implications for suppressing fully developed turbulent flows and beyond.

Recently, novel experiments to search for axion DM have been proposed that use optical cavities to amplify polarization rotation of laser light induced by the axion-photon interaction. One such experiment employs a ring cavity composed of four mirrors. However, its sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\\gamma}$ in the low axion mass region is limited due to a reflection phase difference between s- and p-polarizations.

Moreover, the laser makes it easier to scan the high axion mass region by tuning the reflection phase difference between s- and p-polarizations. We experimentally confirmed that the phase difference generated upon reflection on a zero phase shift mirror satisfied the requirement of $8.6 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{deg}$, which corresponds to the half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the cavity for p-polarization with the mirror fixed on a folded cavity and a wavelength tunable laser.
