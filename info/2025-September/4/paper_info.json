    "abstract": "           This study explores the application of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for brain tumor classification using MRI images, leveraging quantum computing for enhanced computational efficiency. A dataset of 3,264 MRI images, including glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and non-tumor cases, was utilized. The data was split into 80% training and 20% testing, with an oversampling technique applied to address class imbalance. The QCNN model consists of quantum convolution layers, flatten layers, and dense layers, with a filter size of 2, depth of 4, and 4 qubits, trained over 10 epochs. Two models were developed: a binary classification model distinguishing tumor presence and a multiclass classification model categorizing tumor types. The binary model achieved 88% accuracy, improving to 89% after data balancing, while the multiclass model achieved 52% accuracy, increasing to 62% after oversampling. Despite strong binary classification performance, the multiclass model faced challenges due to dataset complexity and quantum circuit limitations. These findings suggest that QCNNs hold promise for medical imaging applications, particularly in binary classification. However, further refinements, including optimized quantum circuit architectures and hybrid classical-quantum approaches, are necessary to enhance multiclass classification accuracy and improve QCNN applicability in clinical settings.

    "abstract": "           This paper introduces the concept of an economic action constant, denoted ___ E , as a structural analogue to Planck's reduced constant ___ in quantum mechanics. Building on canonical quantization, we define ___ E as the fundamental scale of irreducible uncertainty in macroeconomic dynamics through non-commuting observables ( X, PX ), derive uncertainty relations and a semi-classical limit, and study spectral properties under a double-well economic potential. Numerical simulations show that ___ E governs regime transitions between deterministic, probabilistic, and highly unstable dynamics, with topological changes in phase-space and bifurcations emerging under harmonic modulation of ___ E . We propose a systemic economic interpretation linking the magnitude of ___ E to expectation coordination, institutional stability, and structural volatility, and provide historical analogies (post-war reconstruction, speculative bubbles, systemic crises). We finally outline an empirical strategy to estimate ___ E from macro time series and agent-based simulations, opening a path toward a taxonomy of economic regimes under radical uncertainty.

But these advances have been limited to the infrared wavelengths due to the high loss of PCMs in the visible regime. Here we demonstrate a nonvolatile visible metasurface that is electrically reconfigurable using wide bandgap PCM Sb2S3. Our device supports a resonant mode at 610 nm, a wavelength largely under-explored for PCM-based metasurfaces. By incorporating only a 20 nm thick layer of Sb2S3, we experimentally demonstrate a resonance tuning range of 16 nm. Reversible switching of the metasurface is accomplished in situ using a carefully engineered, ultrathin doped silicon micro-heater. Our work paves the way for integrating PCMs into visible-frequency systems, particularly for human-centric applications such as augmented and virtual reality displays.         ",

    "abstract": "           Photonic integrated circuits route and shape light on a chip, but back-reflections feed back into coherent on-chip lasers, destabilizing operation and corrupting signals. Robust operation requires an integrated optical isolator that strongly suppresses backward propagation while maintaining low-loss, broadband forward transmission. However, prior on-chip isolators rely on magneto-optic materials or resonance-based filters, which respectively demand non-standard processes or inherently constrain bandwidth. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a traveling-wave optical isolator without magnetic materials or resonant elements. By driving four parallel optical channels with periodic RF waves, we realize dynamic rotating destructive interference that continuously cancels backward-propagating light while leaving forward-propagating light unaffected. We achieve about 30 dB isolation at a wavelength of 789.7 nm and maintain over 24 dB isolation across an approximately 30 nm bandwidth (770 nm to 800 nm), including >20 dB isolation for two simultaneous lasers within an approximately 10 nm wavelength window. This wavelength span covers key alkali atomic transitions, enabling strong suppression of feedback-induced frequency noise and laser instability in atomic spectroscopy, laser cooling, and locking applications. We demonstrate a practical, broadband on-chip isolator applicable from the visible to the near-infrared, which is a crucial step toward fully integrated photonic platforms.         ",

    "abstract": "           To reach and maintain high contrast levels, coronagraph instruments will require a combination of low-order and high-order wavefront control techniques to correct for dynamic wavefront error. Efficient low-order wavefront sensing and control (LOWFSC) schemes use the starlight rejected by the coronagraph such that LOWFSC can operate with a relatively bright signal to correct rapid disturbances. Meanwhile, a family of high-order wavefront sensing and control (HOWFSC) techniques utilizing the science camera have been developed to create regions of high contrast known as dark holes. These two control loops must operate simultaneously for dark holes to be maintained over long observation periods. Using a 952 actuator MEMS deformable mirror and a vector vortex coronagraph (VVC) on the Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB), we demonstrate a Lyot-based LOWFSC loop operating in combination with a HOWFSC loop. For these experiments, implicit electric field conjugation (iEFC) is the chosen HOWFSC technique, and we demonstrate how this empirical method can be calibrated and deployed while the LOWFSC loop corrects for dynamic wavefront error. We show this combination of LOWFSC and iEFC maintained 1E-8 contrast levels in air.         ",

For photomultipliers, suppressing dark currents is critical, but there exists a tradeoff between maximizing the band gap while remaining sensitive to the wavelength of interest, and minimizing the incorporation of new defects by growing not-yet-optimized alloys. We present a series of capacitance-based measurements, including deep level optical spectroscopy, steady-state photocapacitance and illuminated capacitance-voltage, on photodiodes with lightly \\textit{n}-type Al$_x$In$_y$Ga$_{1-x-y}$P absorber regions. Several deep levels are identified, including one near midgap. While the inclusion of aluminum increases each trap density by approximately 10x, the hole capture cross section also appears to decrease, suggesting that Shockley-Read-Hall dark currents may be suppressed. These materials may be good candidates for development into silicon photomultiplier analogs with wider bandgap for scintillator applications.         ",

This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter, particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing. This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques (where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \\mu s) with respect to the arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases, shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring, etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future trends.

    "abstract": "           Optoelectronic systems based on multiple modes of light can often exceed the performance of their single-mode counterparts. However, multimode nonlinear interactions often introduce considerable amounts of noise, limiting the ultimate performance of these systems. It is therefore crucial to develop ways to simultaneously control complex nonlinear interactions while also gaining control over their noise. Here, we show that noise buildup in nonlinear multimode systems can be strongly suppressed by controlling the input wavefront. We demonstrate this approach in a multimode fiber by using an active wavefront-shaping protocol to focus a region of high intensity - yet low intensity noise - at the output. Our programmable control of both the input and output reduces the beam noise by 12 dB beyond what linear attenuation achieves, reaching levels near the quantum shot-noise limit. We show that this is possible because the optimally shaped wavefront maximally decouples the output intensity fluctuations from the input laser fluctuations. These findings are supported by a new theoretical and simulation framework that efficiently captures spatiotemporal quantum noise dynamics in highly multimode nonlinear systems. Our results highlight the potential of programmable wavefront shaping to enable nonlinear multimode technologies that overcome noise buildup to operate at quantum-noise limits.         ",

We propose a single-trunk multi-head (ST-MH) NQS ensemble that share a feature extracting trunk while attaching lightweight heads for each target state. Using a cost function which also has an orthogonality term, we derive exact analytic gradients and overlap derivatives needed to train ST-MH within standard variational Monte Carlo (VMC) workflows. We prove that ST-MH can represent every degenerate eigenstate exactly whenever the feature map of latent width $h$, augmented with a constant, has column space containing the linear span of the targets' log-moduli and (chosen) phase branches together with the constant on the common support where all states are non-vanishing. Under this condition, ST-MH reduces the parameter count and can reduce the leading VMC cost by a factor equal to the degeneracy $K$ relative to other algorithms when $K$ is modest and in trunk dominated regimes. As a numerical proof-of-principle, we validate and benchmark the ST-MH approach on the frustrated spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model at the Majumdar-Ghosh point on periodic ring lattices of up to 8 sites. By obtaining the momentum eigenstates, we demonstrate that ST-MH attains high fidelity and energy accuracy across degenerate ground state manifolds while using significantly lower computing resources. Lastly we provide a qualitative computational cost analysis which incentivise the applicability of the ST-MH ensemble under certain criteria on the latent width.         ",

To achieve this, these observatories will require coronagraphs and wavefront control algorithms in order to achieve $10^{-10}$ or better starlight suppression. The Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB) is a vacuum compatible testbed at the University of Arizona which aims to advance and mature starlight suppression technologies in a space-like environment. In its current configuration, SCoOB is a charge-6 vector vortex coronagraph outfitted with a Kilo-C microelectromechanical systems deformable mirror capable of achieving sub-$10^{-8}$ dark hole contrast at visible wavelengths using implicit electric field conjugation (iEFC). In this work, we demonstrate the use of a self-coherent camera (SCC) for dark hole digging and maintenance on SCoOB. The SCC introduces a small off-axis pinhole in the Lyot plane which allows some starlight to reach the focal plane and interfere with residual speckles. This enables high-order focal-plane wavefront sensing which can be combined with active wavefront control to null the speckles in a specified region of high contrast known as the dark hole. We discuss considerations for implementation, potential limitations, and provide a performance comparison with iEFC. We also discuss the design optimization and fabrication process for our SCC Lyot stops.         ",

    "abstract": "           This work builds upon the long-standing conjecture that linear diffusion models are inadequate for complex market dynamics. Specifically, it provides experimental validation for the author's prior arguments that realistic market dynamics are governed by higher-order (cubic and higher) non-linearities in the drift. As the diffusion drift is given by the negative gradient of a potential function, this means that a non-linear drift translates into a non-quadratic potential. These arguments were based both on general theoretical grounds as well as a structured approach to modeling the price dynamics which incorporates money flows and their impact on market prices. Here, we find direct confirmation of this view by analyzing high-frequency crypto currency data at different time scales ranging from minutes to months. We find that markets can be characterized by either a single-well or a double-well potential, depending on the time period and sampling frequency, where a double-well potential may signal market uncertainty or stress.

The dynamics are governed by classical beam optics parameters (Courant-Snyder parameters), the Twiss functions, and phase advance, revealing a direct map between quantum evolution and its classical counterpart. The solution decomposes into three components, exhibiting a complex rotation dependent on the sign of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection, alongside an intrinsic distortion from interference governed by a generalized Gouy phase. For a relevant Glaser-type magnetic field and a half-blocked twisted electron, we demonstrate that asymmetry triggers rich dynamics incompatible with a simple Bohmian trajectory interpretation. Our fully relativistic framework provides a powerful tool for predicting beam behavior in particle accelerators and electron microscopes, critical for designing next-generation OAM-based experiments.

Here, we report on the development of ultrafast four-dimensional (4D) scanning transmission electron microscopy, which allows us to image the transverse components of the optical near-field while avoiding the need of electron spectral filtering.

A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, demonstrated structures in laser-induced pattern formation have been relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of nanofabrication techniques.

Silicon photonic technologies, owing to their high speed, low latency, large bandwidth, and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatibility, have been widely implemented for data transfer and actively explored as photonic neural networks in AI clusters. However, current silicon photonic integrated chips lack adaptability for multifuncional use and hardware-software systematic coordination. Here, we develop a reconfigurable silicon photonic processor with $40$ programmable unit cells integrating over $160$ component, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to realize diverse functions with a chip for AI clusters, from computing acceleration and signal processing to network swtiching and secure encryption.

Semiempirical models occupied a large share of this market in its early days, but the research activity in atomistic simulation has steadily polarized over the last three decades towards general-purpose but expensive ab initio quantum mechanics methods and fast but special-purpose molecular mechanics methods. I offer perspective on recent trends in atomistic simulation from the middle ground of semiempirical modeling, to learn from its past success and consider its possible paths to future growth. In particular, there is a lot of ongoing research activity in combining semiempirical quantum mechanics with machine learning models and some unrealized possibilities of tighter integration between ab initio and semiempirical quantum mechanics with more flexible theoretical frameworks and more modular software components.

Despite its ubiquity, RTI experiments are challenging; here, we report the observation of the RTI in an immiscible binary superfluid consisting of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We force these components together to initiate the instability, and observe the growth of mushroom-like structures. The interface can also be stabilized, allowing us to spectroscopically measure the \"ripplon\" interface modes. Lastly, we use matter-wave interferometry to transform the superfluid velocity field at the interface into a vortex chain.

In that context, it has been discussed that Markov chains problems could be solved significantly faster using quantum computing. Indeed, previous work suggests that quantum computers could accelerate sampling from the stationary distribution of reversible Markov chains. However, in practice, certain physical processes of interest are nonreversible in the probabilistic sense and reversible Markov chains can sometimes be replaced by more efficient nonreversible chains targeting the same stationary distribution. This study constructs Markov chain reversibilizations and develops quantum algorithmic techniques to accelerate nonreversible processes. Such an up-to-exponential quantum speedup goes beyond the predicted quadratic quantum acceleration for reversible chains and is likely to have a decisive impact on many applications ranging from statistics and machine learning to computational modeling in physics, chemistry, biology and finance.

Specifically, we experimentally harness the transverse spatial degrees of freedom of light within an optical processing framework based on heralded single photons. The integration is performed over binary phase patterns encoded via a phase-only spatial light modulator, with polarization serving as an auxiliary degree of freedom. Our findings reveal a distinct contrast in how spatial correlations affect image analysis: spatially uncorrelated photons are more effective at capturing the global features of an image encoded in the modulator, whereas spatially correlated photons exhibit enhanced sensitivity to local image details. Importantly, the optical integration scheme presented here bears a strong conceptual and operational resemblance to the DQC1 (Deterministic Quantum Computation with One Qubit) model.
