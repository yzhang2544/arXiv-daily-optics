    "abstract": "           Uplink pre-compensation in ground-to-satellite optical links remains a problem, with an appropriate measurement of the wavefront error in the uplink path often not being available. We present a method that uses successive measurements of the readily accessible downlink beam to perform a tomographic reconstruction of the volume of atmosphere common to the downlink beam and the ground-station field-of-view. These measurements are done through the existing downlink wavefront sensor. From here, an estimate of the wavefront error along the uplink path can be obtained. We evaluate this method in simulation over representative atmospheric conditions and find good performance, especially for situations where the satellite point-ahead angle is many times greater than the atmosphere's isoplanatic angle. Compared to pre-compensation directly using the downlink phase, we find that this method estimates the uplink path with a residual mean-square wavefront error that is up to 8.6 times less. The hardware simplicity of this method makes it a promising solution for uplink pre-compensation implementations targeted at optical communications.         ",

    "abstract": "           Graphene's exceptional nonlinear optical properties combined with resonant photonic structures offer a promising pathway for efficient nonlinear applications at terahertz (THz) frequencies. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a fabrication-friendly hybrid nonlinear metasurface composed of gold patches integrated with uniform graphene, circumventing the need for complex graphene patterning. The structure supports strong localized resonances that enhance nonlinear interactions. By exploiting resonant enhancement at both the fundamental and third harmonic frequencies, we predict via simulations third-harmonic generation efficiencies as high as -15 dB (3.2%) under continuous-wave excitation at modest intensities (0.1 MW/cm$^2$). The metasurface is fabricated via electron-beam lithography and experimentally characterized using THz time-domain spectroscopy. Under pulsed excitation, we experimentally observe pronounced nonlinear frequency shifts up to 0.5~THz (12.5% fractional change), driven by self-phase modulation, consistent with simulation results. These findings highlight the potential of tailored graphene-based metasurfaces for efficient nonlinear THz photonic devices.         ",

High accuracy on position and dose rate in beam monitoring are major cornerstones of clinical success in particle therapy. A high voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) monolithic active pixel sensor was developed for this beam monitoring system. The HV-CMOS technology has demonstrated many advantages over other technologies in dealing with radiation tolerance. This HV-CMOS sensor was produced with a 180 nm commercial technology on high-resistivity substrate. The HitPix sensor features several specific design details for operation in a high-intensity ion beam environment: hit-counting pixels, on-sensor projection calculation, radiation tolerant design and frame-based readout. It has a 9775 $\\mu$m $\\times$ 10110 $\\mu$m sensor area with 200 $\\mu$m $\\times$ 200 $\\mu$m pixel size. The new HitPix3 has a number of improvements, including a modified in-pixel amplifier, on-sensor calculation of beam profile projection in two dimensions, and in-pixel threshold tuning capacity. The functionality of these features was confirmed in laboratory tests of unirradiated HitPix3 sensors, making the HitPix3 an important step in developing a sensor for use in ion beam monitoring.

    "abstract": "           Silicon photonics provides a versatile platform for large-scale integration of optical functions, but its weak intrinsic nonlinear response limits the realization of active, intensity-dependent functionalities. Hybrid integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a promising strategy to overcome these limitations by enabling strong light--matter interaction and broadband absorption. Here, we demonstrate saturable absorption in a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible silicon-on-insulator (SOI) microring resonator integrated with an exfoliated monolayer of 1T'-MoTe2. Transmission measurements under varying input powers reveal a clear nonlinear absorption response, with a saturation power as low as 2(1)uW. A phenomenological model accurately reproduces the experimental results, confirming the nonlinear behavior induced by the hybrid MoTe2 integration. These findings establish a proof-of-concept for ultracompact, low-power saturable absorbers in photonic integrated circuits (PICs), paving the way for applications in integrated lasers, ultrafast optical signal processing, and neuromorphic photonics.

By phase modulating the Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) between a DKS and an externally injected reference laser, we observe chaotic group velocity hopping of the soliton, causing random transitions of the repetition rate. Using a chip-integrated octave-spanning microcomb, we experimentally validate the second-order Adler equation describing KIS, allowing us to predict and demonstrate this chaotic DKS hopping.

    "abstract": "           Precision atomic and quantum experiments rely on ultra-stable narrow linewidth lasers constructed using table-top ultra-low expansion reference cavities. These experiments often require multiple lasers, operating at different wavelengths, to perform key steps used in state preparation and measurement required in quantum sensing and computing. This is traditionally achieved by disciplining a cavity-stabilized laser to a key atomic transition and then transferring the transition linewidth and stability to other lasers using the same reference cavity in combination with bulk-optic frequency shifting such as acousto-optic modulators. Transitioning such capabilities to a low cost photonic-integrated platform will enable a wide range of portable, low power, scalable quantum experiments and applications. Yet, today's bulk optic approaches pose challenges related to lack of cavity tunability, large free spectral range, and limited photonic integration potential. Here, we address these challenges with demonstration of an agile photonic-integrated 780 nm ultra-high-Q tunable silicon nitride reference cavity that performs multiple critical experimental steps including laser linewidth narrowing, high resolution rubidium spectroscopy, dual-stage stabilization to a rubidium transition, and stability transfer to other lasers. We achieve up to 20 dB of frequency noise reduction at 10 kHz offset, precision spectroscopy over a 250 MHz range, and dual-stage locking to rubidium with an Allan deviation of $8.5 \\times 10^{-12}$ at 1 s and up to 40 dB reduction at 100 Hz. We further demonstrate the transfer of this atomic stability to a second laser, via the rubidium-disciplined cavity, and demonstrate multi-wavelength Rydberg electrometry quantum sensing. These results pave the path for integrated, compact, and scalable solutions for quantum sensing, computing and other atomic and trapped ion applications.         ",

However, there remains a lack of suitable theoretical tools for scrutinizing light-matter interactions in metamedia, particularly those involving distinct constitutive tensors, such as polarization cross-coupling or non-reciprocal propagation induced by bianisotropy. In this research, we apply the generalized transfer matrix method and matrix Fourier Optics to devise a novel hybrid methodology adept at efficiently tracing an optical beam as it propagates through transverse-homogeneous, longitudinal-inhomogeneous bianisotropic media. Our proof-of-concept demonstration elucidates the interaction between a nonparaxial Gaussian incident beam with various linear/circular polarizations and a mismatched anisotropic double-negative (DNG) metamaterial. We unveil the nontrivial bifocal effect and optical vortex (OV) generation and focusing phenomena in a three-dimensional environment, findings that have not been documented previously. Significantly, the proposed efficient methodology holds the potential for application in examining more promising physical phenomena exhibited by intricate metamaterials, enabling a more visually rigorous approach.

In this work, we numerically explore the effect of optical feedback on the emission properties of a dual-wavelength laser using a rate equation model. We focus on switching capability and investigate the impact of key laser and feedback parameters. We connect the emergence of simultaneous emission to a lower cross-saturation between modes, and demonstrate that robust switching can be achieved using a short feedback cavity and a sufficiently strong feedback. In particular and in contrast to previous publications, we highlight that the feedback phase difference between the two modes is not a critical parameter. Our results are consistent with recent experimental observations, supporting the relevance of feedback-based control techniques for multi-wavelength lasers.         ",

A current central task for frequency-domain photons is the creation and manipulation of nontrivial non-Abelian field strength tensors and observing their governing dynamics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a miniaturized scheme for creating non-Abelian electric fields in a photonic frequency chain using a polarization-multiplexed, time-modulated ring resonator. By engineering spin-orbit coupling via modulation dephasing, polarization rotation, and polarization retardation, we achieve programmable control over synthetic Floquet bands and their quasimomentum spin-resolved textures. Leveraging self-heterodyne coherent detection, we demonstrate Zitterbewegung -- a trembling motion of photons -- induced by non-Abelian electric fields on the frequency chain. We further observe the interference between Zitterbewegung and Bloch oscillations arising from the coexistence of non-Abelian and Abelian electric fields. Our work bridges synthetic dimensions with non-Abelian gauge theory for versatile photonic emulation of relativistic quantum mechanics and spinor dynamics, and can be instrumental in applications like frequency-domain optical computation and multimodal frequency comb control.

To cope with these high rates in the pixel trackers, per-pixel time measurements are required, which implies the need for fast sensors. The inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) is one of the fast sensor options that is being investigated. This paper will show the results of an inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) with a pitch of 55 \\textmu m, a thickness of 250~\\textmu m and a large-area (2~cm$^2$), bump bonded to a Timepix4 ASIC. Timepix4 has 195~ps time binning on each pixel and therefore an excellent ASIC to test the sensor. The sensor is characterised with radio-active source measurements in the lab, and during beam test at the CERN SPS North Area H8 beamline, where the Timepix4 telescope was used. The telescope has a time reference of 12~ps and a pointing resolution of 2.4 $\\pm$ 0.1~\\textmu m. The iLGAD shows an almost uniform gain of approximately 4 and an efficiency of 99.6 $\\pm$ 0.1\\%. Without any corrections the obtained time resolution is about 750~ps. After timewalk and clock corrections the time resolution becomes 377 $\\pm$ 7~ps.

    "abstract": "           The coffee-ring effect is a universal feature of evaporating sessile droplets with pinned contact line, wherein solutes or particles are advected to the droplet's edge due to evaporation-driven flows. While existing models have successfully described this phenomenon in particle-laden droplets, they often assume that hydrodynamics are decoupled from solute transport. This assumption breaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where the solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here, we investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt, and a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe the formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water evaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence on ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models cannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is governed by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation rate. To account for this, we develop a minimal theoretical model based on the lubrication approximation, incorporating the coupling between hydrodynamics and solute transport through the evaporation rate. Our framework reproduces key features of the experimental observations and suggests a physical basis for the $H_r$-dependent stability and infectivity of respiratory droplets containing viruses.

Coupling resonant structures to a near-zero-index (NZI) environment has been shown to enhance their optical performance by both increasing spontaneous emission rates and improving emission directionality. In this work, we comparatively study emission characteristics of colloidal PbS/CdS (core/shell) quantum dots at telecom wavelengths on different substrates, where two different sets of quantum dots emitting within and outside the epsilon-near-zero region are deposited on both glass and indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. Our results demonstrate that coupling quantum dots to the epsilon-near-zero spectral region results in a reduction of photoluminescence lifetime of 54~times, a 7.5-fold increase in saturation intensity, and a relative emission cone narrowing from 17.6\u00b0 to 10.3\u00b0. These results underline the strong dependence of quantum dot emission properties on the spectral overlap with the epsilon-near-zero condition, highlighting the potential of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), such as ITO, for integration into next-generation quantum photonic devices. Due to their CMOS compatibility, fabrication tunability, and high thermal and optical damage thresholds, TCO NZI materials offer a robust platform for scalable and high-performance quantum optical systems operating within the telecom bandwidth.

    "abstract": "           Ising machines offer a compelling approach to addressing NP-hard problems, but physical realizations that are simultaneously scalable, reconfigurable, fast, and stable remain elusive. Quantum annealers, like D-Wave's cryogenic hardware, target combinatorial optimization tasks, but quadratic scaling of qubit requirements with problem size limits their scalability on dense graphs. Here, we introduce a programmable, stable, room-temperature optoelectronic oscillator (OEO)-based Ising machine with linear scaling in spin representation. Inspired by Hopfield networks, our architecture solves fully-connected problems with up to 256 spins (65,536 couplings), and $>$41,000 spins (205,000+ couplings) if sparse. Our system leverages cascaded thin-film lithium niobate modulators, a semiconductor optical amplifier, and a digital signal processing (DSP) engine in a recurrent time-encoded loop, demonstrating potential $>$200 giga-operations per second for spin coupling and nonlinearity. This platform achieves the largest spin configuration in an OEO-based photonic Ising machine, enabled by high intrinsic speed. We experimentally demonstrate best-in-class solution quality for Max-Cut problems of arbitrary graph topologies (2,000 and 20,000 spins) among photonic Ising machines and obtain ground-state solutions for number partitioning and lattice protein folding - benchmarks previously unaddressed by photonic systems. Our system leverages inherent noise from high baud rates to escape local minima and accelerate convergence. Finally, we show that embedding DSP - traditionally used in optical communications - within optical computation enhances convergence and solution quality, opening new frontiers in scalable, ultrafast computing for optimization, neuromorphic processing, and analog AI.

    "abstract": "           Accurate acoustic simulations of enclosed spaces require precise boundary conditions, typically expressed through surface impedances for wave-based methods. Conventional measurement techniques often rely on simplifying assumptions about the sound field and mounting conditions, limiting their validity for real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a Bayesian framework for the in situ estimation of frequency-dependent acoustic surface impedances from sparse interior sound pressure measurements. The approach employs simulation-based inference, which leverages the expressiveness of modern neural network architectures to directly map simulated data to posterior distributions of model parameters, bypassing conventional sampling-based Bayesian approaches and offering advantages for high-dimensional inference problems. Impedance behavior is modeled using a damped oscillator model extended with a fractional calculus term. The framework is verified on a finite element model of a cuboid room and further tested with impedance tube measurements used as reference, achieving robust and accurate estimation of all six individual impedances. Application to a numerical car cabin model further demonstrates reliable uncertainty quantification and high predictive accuracy even for complex-shaped geometries. Posterior predictive checks and coverage diagnostics confirm well-calibrated inference, highlighting the method's potential for generalizable, efficient, and physically consistent characterization of acoustic boundary conditions in real-world interior environments.

To diminish computational time, these operations are implemented by parallel computations using different coprocessors. In this work we show that open quantum system consisting of bosonic modes and interacting with bosonic reservoirs can be used as analog coprocessor implementing multiple vector-matrix multiplications with stochastic matrices in parallel. Input vectors are encoded in occupancies of reservoirs, and output result is presented by stationary energy flows. The operation takes time needed for the system's transition to non-equilibrium stationary state independently on number of the reservoirs, i.e., on the input vector dimension. The computations are accompanied by entropy growth. We construct a direct mapping between open quantum systems and electrical crossbar structures, showing that dissipation rates multiplied by OQS's modes frequencies can be seen as conductivities, reservoirs' occupancies can be seen as potentials, and stationary energy flows can be seen as electric currents.

However, all measurements of time dilation so far can be explained effectively as the result of dynamics with respect to a classical proper time parameter. Here we show that atomic clocks can probe effects where a classical description of the proper time dynamics is insufficient. We apply a Hamiltonian formalism to derive time dilation effects in harmonically trapped clock atoms and show how second-order Doppler shifts (SODS) due to the vacuum energy (vSODS), squeezing (sqSODS) and quantum corrections to the dynamics (qSODS) arise. We also demonstrate that the entanglement between motion and clock evolution can become observable in state-of-the-art clocks when the motion of the atoms is strongly squeezed, realizing proper time interferometry. Our results show that experiments with trapped ion clocks are within reach to probe relativistic evolution of clocks for which a quantum description of proper time becomes necessary.         ",

New results include 1) a reconstruction of Einstein's incompleteness argument, which concludes that a local, separable, and categorical QM cannot exist, 2) a reinterpretation of Bohr's principle of correspondence, grounded in the principle of permanence, 3) a meaning-variance argument for quantum logic, which follows a line of critical reflections initiated by Weyl, and 4) an argument for semantic indeterminacy leveled against inferentialism about QM, inspired by Carnap's work in the philosophy of classical logic.

Typically, however, these parameters are not directly observable. What is observed instead is a time sequence of radiographic projections using X-rays. In this work, we define a set of sparse hydrodynamic features derived from the outgoing shock profile and outer material edge, which can be obtained from radiographic measurements, to directly infer such parameters. Our machine learning (ML)-based methodology involves a pipeline of two architectures, a radiograph-to-features network (R2FNet) and a features-to-parameters network (F2PNet), that are trained independently and later combined to approximate a posterior distribution for the parameters from radiographs. We show that the estimated parameters can be used in a hydrodynamics code to obtain density fields and hydrodynamic shock and outer edge features that are consistent with the data. Finally, we demonstrate that features resulting from an unknown EOS model can be successfully mapped onto parameters of a chosen analytical EOS model, implying that network predictions are learning physics, with a degree of invariance to the underlying choice of EOS model.

    "abstract": "           Low Gain Avalanche Diodes, also known as LGADs, are widely considered for fast-timing applications in high energy physics, nuclear physics, space science, medical imaging, and precision measurements of rare processes. Such devices are silicon-based and feature an intrinsic gain due to a $p{^+}$-doped layer that allows the production of a controlled avalanche of carriers, with multiplication on the order of 10-100. This technology can provide time resolution on the order of 20-30 ps, and variants of this technology can provide precision tracking too. The characterization of LGAD performance has so far primarily been focused on the interaction of minimum ionizing particles for high energy and nuclear physics applications. This article expands the study of LGAD performance to highly-ionizing particles, such as 28-MeV protons, which are relevant for several future scientific applications, e.g. in biology and medical physics, among others. These studies were performed with a beam of 28-MeV protons from a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beta particles from a $^{90}{\\rm Sr}$ source; these were used to characterize the response and the gain of an LGAD as a function of bias voltage and collected charge.

    "abstract": "           Advanced X-ray spectroscopic techniques are widely recognized as state-of-the-art tools for probing the electronic structure, bonding, and chemical environments of the heaviest elements in the periodic table. In this study, we employ X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements in high-energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD-XANES) mode to investigate the core states arising from excitations out of the U 3d${_{3/2}}$ (M$_4$ edge) levels for molecular complexes in which the uranyl moiety deviates from linearity to varying degrees, and in particular systems containing the UO$_2$Cl$_2$ group such as UO$_2$Cl$_2$.n(H$_2$O) and UO$_2$Cl$_2$(phen)$_2$, which in the latter case exhibits a pronounced O-U-O bending angle. These U M$_4$ edge HERFD-XANES spectra are compared to those of other uranyl complexes reported in the literature. This evaluation is complemented by \\textit{ab initio} relativistic quantum chemistry simulations on the [UO$_2$(NO$_3$)$_2$.n(H$_2$O)], UO$_2$Cl$_2$.n(H$_2$O) and UO$_2$Cl$_2$(phen)$_2$ systems, using 2-component Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) with the CAM-B3LYP functional, employing the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (2c-TDA). Our 2c-TDA simulations show modest deviations from the HERFD-XANES data, with peak splittings differing by less than 1 eV from experimental values. These core-excited states were further characterized by Natural Transition Orbital (NTO) analysis. Overall, our results highlight the influence of equatorial ligands on the spectroscopic signatures, particularly pronounced in UO$_2$Cl$_2$(phen)$_2$, where the U 3d$_{3/2}$ $\\rightarrow$ 5f$\\sigma_u^*$ satellite transition appears at lower energies compared to the other systems studied.

    "abstract": "           This paper formally defines the optogeometric factor $F_{\\mathrm{opg}}$ as a pixel level quantity of geometric optical throughput, with units of $\\text{m}^2\\cdot\\text{sr}$ (or $\\text{m}^2$ in reduced form), derived from \u00e9tendue. Whereas \u00e9tendue is conventionally used to characterise the throughput of entire optical systems, the optogeometric factor is localised to the level of a single detector pixel, providing a new way to link scene radiance to the radiant flux actually collected by that pixel. Although examples are drawn from infrared thermography, the formulation is general and applies equally to visible, ultraviolet, and Xray imaging systems. The underlying radiometric principle is well established: classical radiometry already relates radiance, area, and solid angle. The new contribution of this work is to isolate that pixel level term, to name it as $F_{\\mathrm{opg}}$, and to derive its explicit forms. In this way, $F_{\\mathrm{opg}}$ acts as a compact and universal descriptor of pixel level radiometric throughput. The present study builds on an earlier quantitative thermography equation that already expressed the radiant flux collected by an individual pixel. In that formulation, the scene based form of the optogeometric factor was present only implicitly, embedded in the derivation. Here, $F_{\\mathrm{opg}}$ is made explicit as an independent radiometric quantity, providing a more transparent and general framework that links pixel level geometry to radiometric throughput. Two formulations of $F_{\\mathrm{opg}}$ are derived: a scene based form, expressed through the pixel footprint area and instantaneous field of view, and a sensor based form, expressed through the pixel pitch and optical $f$number. They coincide numerically under the paraxial approximation and other conditions discussed in this work.         ",
