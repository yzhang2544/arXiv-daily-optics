    "title": "Noncommutative Number Systems for Quantum Information",
    "abstract": "           Dirac talked about q-numbers versus c-numbers. Quantum observables are q-number variables that generally do not commute among themselves. He was proposing to have a generalized form of numbers as elements of a noncommutative algebra. That was Dirac's appreciation of the mathematical properties of the physical quantities as presented in Heisenberg's new quantum theory. After all, the familiar real, or complex, number system only came into existence through the history of mathematics. Values of physical quantities having a commutative product is an assumption that is not compatible with quantum physics. The revolutionary idea of Heisenberg and Dirac was pulled back to a much more conservative setting by the work of Schr\u00f6dinger, followed by Born and Bohr. What Bohr missed is that the real number values we obtained from our measurements are only a consequence of the design of the kind of experiments and our using real numbers to calibrate the output scales of our apparatus. It is only our modeling of the information obtained about the physical quantities rather than what Nature dictates. We have proposed an explicit notion of definite noncommutative values of observables that gives a picture of quantum mechanics as realistic as the classical theory. In this article, we illustrate how matrices can be taken as noncommutative (q-)numbers serving as the values of physical quantities, each to be seen as a piece of quantum information. Our main task is to clarify the subtle issues involved in setting up a conventional scheme assigning matrices as values to the physical quantities.         ",

    "abstract": "           The understanding and optimization of solar energy conversion and light emitting devices can greatly benefit from equivalent circuit models describing their response. However, a general model of electron-hole recombination in semiconductors is currently missing. This study presents equivalent circuit models of radiative and non-radiative electron-hole recombination based on their linearized analytical treatment. These are integrated in a circuit model of complete devices that is equivalent to the linearized drift-diffusion equations in one dimension. The analysis shows that, for most situations involving semiconductors without mobile ions, approximated models that do not account for local electrostatics are sufficient to describe non-radiative recombination. The influence of local electrostatics becomes essential in mixed conducting devices, and it should be included explicitly in equivalent circuit models. Recombination resistors used for traditional semiconductors are indeed a special case of the general model, for which transistors implement a more accurate representation. For mixed conducting devices, such as hybrid metal-halide perovskite solar cells, appropriate simplifications of the complete model provide analytical solutions describing the bulk and interfacial polarization effects that influence local electrostatics, recombination currents and overall impedance. The resulting analysis is relevant for a wide range of materials and devices used for solar energy conversion as well as other optoelectronic and photo-electrochemical applications.         ",

Such junctions are referred to as one-dimensional (1D) hotspots (HSs). This study found that two-photon excited emissions, such as hyper-Rayleigh, hyper-Raman, and two-photon fluorescence of dye molecules, are generated at the edge of 1D HSs of NW dimers with continuous-wave near-infrared (NIR) laser excitation and propagated through the 1D HSs; however, they were not generated from the centers of 1D HSs. Numerical EM calculations showed that FR of the NIR region for the edges of 1D HSs was larger than that for the centers by approximately 104 times, resulting in the observation of two-photon excited emissions only from the edge of 1D HSs. The analysis of the NW dimer gap distance dependence of FR revealed that the lowest surface plasmon (SP) mode, compressed and localized at the edges of the 1D HSs, was the origin of the large FR in the NIR region. The propagation of two-photon-excited emissions was supported by higher-order coupled SP mode.         ",

Despite the promise of laser modulation in achieving this goal, it brings about a noticeable decline in beam quality. Efforts to mitigate this decline have resulted in the proposal of demodulation schemes. However, implementing modulation and demodulation within the storage ring presents significant challenges due to dynamical and spatial constraints within straight sections. In this study, we propose a straightforward and easily implementable method for achieving reversible laser modulation in a storage ring. Notably, our approach circumvents the need for special storage ring requirements, such as lengthy straight sections or bypass section. Simulation results demonstrate a substantial restoration of beam quality following demodulation. This innovative scheme holds great promise for the realization of high repetition rate coherent storage ring light sources.         ",

The high resolution allowed us to clearly visualize the spatial distributions of produced bubbles in the porous electrodes over time. Moreover, we are able to quantify the residual gas volume in an electrode and its coverage due to bubble evolution, which dominate its transport overpotential. Taking these advantages, we elucidate the impacts of electrodes' wettability and structures on their electrolysis performance, on a regular laboratory base.

However existing inverse design tools based on finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) models are poorly suited for optimizing waveguide modes for adiabatic transformation or perturbative coupling, which lies at the heart of many important photonic devices. Among these, dispersion engineering of optical waveguides is especially challenging in ultrafast and nonlinear optical applications involving broad optical bandwidths and frequency-dependent anisotropic dielectric material response. In this work we develop gradient back-propagation through a general purpose electromagnetic eigenmode solver and use it to demonstrate waveguide dispersion optimization for second harmonic generation with maximized phase-matching bandwidth. This optimization of three design parameters converges in eight steps, reducing the computational cost of optimization by ~100x compared to exhaustive search and identifies new designs for broadband optical frequency doubling of laser sources in the 1.3-1.4 micron wavelength range.Furthermore we demonstrate that the computational cost of gradient back-propagation is independent of the number of parameters, as required for optimization of complex geometries.

Thin-film lithium niobate is a promising platform for on-chip photon-pair generation through spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). However, the device implementation faces practical challenges. Periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN), despite enabling flexible quasi-phase matching, suffers from poor fabrication reliability and device repeatability, while conventional modal phase matching (MPM) methods yield limited efficiencies due to inadequate mode overlaps. Here, we introduce a layer-poled lithium niobate (LPLN) nanophotonic waveguide for efficient photon-pair generation. It leverages layer-wise polarity inversion through electrical poling to break spatial symmetry and significantly enhance nonlinear interactions for MPM, achieving a notable normalized second-harmonic generation (SHG) conversion efficiency of 4615% W^{-1}cm^{-2}. Through a cascaded SHG and SPDC process, we demonstrate photon-pair generation with a normalized brightness of 3.1*10^6 Hz nm^{-1} mW^{-2} in a 3.3 mm long LPLN waveguide, surpassing existing on-chip sources under similar operating configurations. Crucially, our LPLN waveguides offer enhanced fabrication reliability and reduced sensitivity to geometric variations and temperature fluctuations compared to PPLN devices. We expect LPLN to become a promising solution for on-chip nonlinear wavelength conversion and non-classical light generation, with immediate applications in quantum communication, networking, and on-chip photonic quantum information processing.

Exact simulation of reactions in these systems is often hindered by the large number of degrees of freedom and by the essential role of quantum effects.

We employ the ground-state qubit of one ion to simulate the electronic degree of freedom and the optical qubit of another ion to perform reservoir engineering on a collective mode encoding a reaction coordinate. We observe the real-time dynamics of the spin excitation, measuring the transfer rate in several regimes of adiabaticity and relaxation dynamics. The setup allows access to the electron transfer dynamics in the non-perturbative regime, where there is no clear hierarchy among the energy scales in the model, as has been suggested to be optimal for many rate phenomena, including photosynthesis.

It builds upon the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices (QETU) algorithm, and it delivers good approximations in simulations with local, two-qubit gate depolarizing probability up to 1e-3, specifically for Hamiltonians that anti-commute with a Pauli string. To demonstrate the key results in this work, we ran simulations with different system Hamiltonians, system sizes, and time evolution encoding methods on classical computers using Qiskit. We compare the performance with other existing methods and show that we can consistently achieve two to three orders of magnitude improvement in the absolute error rate.         ",

    "abstract": "           I show that frequentism, as an explanation of probability in classical statistical mechanics, can be extended in a natural way to a decoherent quantum history space, the analogue of a classical phase space. The result is a form of finite frequentism, in which the Gibbs concept of an infinite ensemble of gases is replaced by the quantum state expressed as a superposition of a finite number of decohering microstates. It is a form of finite and actual (as opposed to hypothetical) frequentism insofar as all the microstates exist, even though they may differ macroscopically, in keeping with the decoherence-based Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics.
