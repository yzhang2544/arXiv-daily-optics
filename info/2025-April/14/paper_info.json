    "abstract": "           In this study, we find the optimal control boundary (i.e., actuator velocity) that cancels the acoustic reverberations inside drop-on-demand inkjet printheads at a specific time. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total energy of the oscillating flow at a given time (i.e., the acoustic energy inside the microchannel and the surface energy of the droplet). We use the adjoint method to compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to the control boundary, and a gradient-based optimization algorithm to converge to the optimal solution. This methodology has been successfully applied to two generic inkjet printhead mechanisms: thin-film and bulk types. In both cases, the actuator first reduces the surface energy of the system by extracting fluid from the nozzle. In this process, acoustic waves also propagate through the channel and reverberate at the ends, which increases the acoustic energy of the system. The actuator then sends additional acoustic waves that cancel these reverberations. Both mechanisms have been able to reduce the total energy of the system by a factor of over 100 in comparison with the uncontrolled cases.         ",

    "abstract": "           Gradient acoustic metasurfaces have shown strong potential for manipulation of acoustic waves across the audible and ultrasonic frequency ranges. The key challenge in designing acoustic metasurfaces is to create a series of sub-wavelength unit cells that match the desired phase response. The most commonly used geometry is a series of Helmholtz resonators, side-coupled to a narrow channel. Despite the existence of a closed-form solution for 3 side-coupled resonators, most reported designs instead make use of 4 or more resonators, which require opaque, optimization-based design approaches. We show that the limiting factor in designs based on side-coupled resonators is the requirement to use elements with a positive imaginary part of impedance, which implies a Helmholtz resonator operating above its fundamental resonance - contradicting the requirement for sub-wavelength volume. We show that by replacing some of the Helmholtz resonators with meander-line elements, the required impedance values can readily be realized within a sub-wavelength volume. The metasurface design approach is demonstrated for a lens operating at 3 kHz and verified numerically. Furthermore, incorporating meander-line elements leads to improved broadband focusing performance, even when no explicit dispersion engineering is included in the design. As this design includes narrow channels, we include the effects of thermo-viscous losses in our modeling, and confirm that our design still gives superior performance to the reference design using only Helmholtz resonators. Our design is expected to lead to more optimal performance of acoustic metasurface designs, and the ability to make use of a closed-form design formula is expected to facilitate the analysis of fundamental performance bounds and enable more explicit achromatic design processes.

    "abstract": "           In ultrafast experiments with gas phase molecules, the alignment of the molecular axis relative to the polarization of the interacting laser pulses plays a crucial role in determining the dynamics following this light-matter interaction. The molecular axis distribution is influenced by the interacting pulses and is intrinsically linked to the electronic coherences of the excited molecules. However, in typical theoretical calculations of such interactions, the signal is either calculated for a single molecule in the molecular frame or averaged over all possible molecular orientations to compare with the experiment. This averaging leads to the loss of information about anisotropy in the molecular-axis distribution, which could significantly affect the measured experimental signal. Here, we calculate the laboratory frame transient electronic first-order polarization ($P^{(1)}$) spectra in terms of separated molecular frame and laboratory frame quantities. The laboratory frame polarizations are compared with orientation-averaged Quantum Master Equation (QME) calculations, demonstrating that orientation-averaging captures only the isotropic contributions. We show that our formalism allows us to also evaluate the anisotropic contributions to the spectrum. Finally, we discuss the application of this approach to achieve ultrafast quantum state tomography using transient absorption spectroscopy and field observables in nonlinear spectroscopy.         ",

    "abstract": "           Reliable trajectory-based nonadiabatic quantum dynamics methods at the atomic level are critical for understanding many important processes in real systems. The paper reports latest progress of nonadiabatic field (NaF), a conceptually novel approach for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics with independent trajectories. Substantially different from the mainstreams of Ehrenfest-like dynamics and surface hopping methods, the nuclear force in NaF involves the nonadiabatic force arising from the nonadiabatic coupling between different electronic states, in addition to the adiabatic force contributed by a single adiabatic electronic state. NaF is capable of faithfully describing the interplay between electronic and nuclear motion in a broad regime, which covers where the relevant electronic states keep coupled in a wide range or all the time and where the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is essential. NaF is derived from the exact generalized phase space formulation with coordinate-momentum variables, where constraint phase space (CPS) is employed for discrete electronic-state degrees of freedom. We propose efficient integrators for the equations of motion of NaF in both adiabatic and diabatic representations. Since the formalism in the CPS formulation is not unique, NaF can in principle be implemented with various phase space representations of the time correlation function (TCF) for the time-dependent property. They are applied to a suite of representative gas-phase and condensed-phase benchmark models where numerically exact results are available for comparison. It is shown that NaF is relatively insensitive to the phase space representation of the electronic TCF and will be a potential tool for practical and reliable simulations of the quantum mechanical behavior of both electronic and nuclear dynamics of nonadiabatic transition processes in real systems.

In applications such as industrial manufacturing and defense systems, a higher output power is always desired. Nevertheless, the power scaling in fiber lasers is limited by nonlinear effects and transverse mode instability in conventional high-power fiber laser systems, where the laser is amplified within the fundamental fiber mode. A promising strategy to overcome these limitations is to utilize multimode fibers, which exhibit higher thresholds for both nonlinear effects and transverse mode instability, combined with wavefront shaping techniques to convert the output speckle pattern into a single concentrated spot. In this study, a high-power multimode fiber laser amplifier based on wavefront shaping is constructed and investigated, achieving a focused beam profile with a 168 W output power. The effects of objective function and the linewidth of seed laser on the system performance are also studied. Additionally, an all-fiber version of high-brightness multimode fiber laser amplifier is proposed. This work opens up new avenues for leveraging multimode fibers to achieve higher brightness in fiber lasers and may inspire other research based on wavefront shaping.         ",

In contrast to the use of spontaneous emission in a number of NV-magnetometers, laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) exploits stimulated emission of NV centers by placing an NV-doped diamond inside an optical cavity. The NV laser system is predicted to reach a high magnetic contrast and strong coherent signal strength, leading to an improved magnetic field sensitivity combined with a high linearity. Here, we consider a two-media setup where the cavity additionally includes a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. This optically active material compensates cavity losses at 750 nm while still allowing for magnetic-field-dependent effects from the NV-diamond. We demonstrate a magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold and investigate the effects of pump laser induced absorption of the diamond. The experimental data is supported by an analytical simulation based on a rate model. Furthermore, we derive a generalized formula to compute the magnetic field sensitivity in the regime of high contrast yielding 33.79(23) pT/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ for the present setup.

In this work, we aimed to address this gap by investigating how distinct aberrations influence vortex trajectory behavior. We performed numerical simulations of vortex trajectories under manually introduced aberrations and proposed metrics to describe their relationship. Our results show that defocus, coma, and astigmatism each produce a unique trajectory response, allowing differentiation between aberration types present in the beam.

Non-Hermiticity is introduced by adding tunable spin-dependent loss via microwave coupling to a subspace with spontaneous emission. We demonstrate that the resulting Heisenberg equations of motion for position and momentum depend explicitly on the system's phase-space distribution. First, we observe collective nonreciprocal transport in real space, with a \"self-acceleration\" that decreases with the BEC's spatial extent, consistent with non-Hermitian Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. We then examine localized edge states: the relatively strong interactions in our BEC suppress the formation of topological edge states, yielding instead highly excited states localized by an interplay between self-acceleration and wavefunction spreading.

Using gradient boosting machines and global reanalysis data, OTCliM extrapolates one year of measured $C_n^2$ into a multi-year time series. We assess OTCliM's performance using $C_n^2$ data from 17 diverse stations in New York State, evaluating temporal extrapolation capabilities and geographical generalization. Our results demonstrate accurate predictions of four held-out years of $C_n^2$ across various sites, including complex urban environments, outperforming traditional analytical models. Non-urban models also show good geographical generalization compared to urban models, which capture non-general site-specific dependencies. A feature importance analysis confirms the physical consistency of the trained models. It also indicates the potential to uncover new insights into the physical processes governing $C_n^2$ from data.

Usually, even for the simplest systems, such calculations are either performed for low-intensity excitations where perturbative methods are valid and/or by assuming a simplified pulse envelope, such as a $\\delta$-function in time. Here, we use the phase-cycling method for exact calculation of the nonlinear response without making the aforementioned approximations even for high-intensity excitation. We compare the simulation results to several experimental observations to prove the validity of these calculations. The saturation of the photon-echo signal from excitons in a semiconductor quantum well sample is measured. The excitation-intensity dependent measurement shows nonlinear contributions up to twelfth order. Intensity-dependent simulations reproduce this effect without explicitly considering higher-order interactions. Additionally, we present simulation results that replicate previously-reported experiments with high-intensity excitation of semiconductor quantum dots. By accurately reproducing a variety of phenomena such as higher-order contributions, switching of coherent signal, and changes in photon-echo transients, we prove the efficacy of the phase-cycling method to calculate the coherent nonlinear signal for high-intensity excitation.

Density profiles appropriate for tapering were calculated analytically and via particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, and were matched experimentally. These simulations show that tapering can increase electron beam energy using 19 J laser energy from ~9 GeV to >12 GeV in a 30 cm plasma, and the accelerated charge by an order of magnitude.

    "title": "Optimal multipole center for subwavelength acoustic scatterers",
    "abstract": "           The multipole expansion is a powerful framework for analyzing how subwavelength-size objects scatter waves in optics or acoustics. The calculation of multipole moments traditionally uses the scatterer's center of mass as the reference point. The theoretical foundation of this heuristic convention remains an open question. Here, we challenge this convention by demonstrating that a different, optimal multipole center can yield superior results. The optimal center is crucial -- it allows us to accurately express the scattering response while retaining a minimum number of multipole moments. Our analytical technique for finding the optimal multipole centers of individual scatterers, both in isolation and within finite arrays, is validated through numerical simulations. Our findings reveal that such an optimized positioning significantly reduces quadrupole contributions, enabling more accurate monopole-dipole approximations in acoustic calculations. Our approach also improves the computational efficiency of the T-matrix method, offering practical benefits for metamaterial design and analysis.         ",

    "title": "Magnetically assisted vorticity production in decaying acoustic turbulence",
    "abstract": "           We study vorticity production in isothermal, subsonic, acoustic (nonvortical), and decaying turbulence due to the presence of magnetic fields. Using three-dimensional numerical simulations, we find that the resulting kinetic energy cascade follows the ordinary Kolmogorov phenomenology involving a constant spectral energy flux. The nondimensional prefactor for acoustic turbulence is larger than the standard Kolmogorov constant due to the inefficient dissipation of kinetic energy. We also find that the Lorentz force can drive vortical motions even when the initial field is uniform, by converting a fraction of the acoustic energy into vortical energy. This conversion is shown to be quadratic in the magnetic field strength and linear in the acoustic flow speed. By contrast, the direct production of vortical motions by a non-force-free magnetic field is linear in the field strength. Our results suggest that magnetic fields play a crucial role in vorticity production in cosmological flows, particularly in scenarios where significant acoustic turbulence is prevalent. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the early Universe, where magnetic fields may convert acoustic turbulence generated during cosmological phase transitions into vortical turbulence.

    "title": "Multi-Frequency Reverberant Shear Waves for Assessing Tissue Dispersion in Optical Coherence Elastography",
    "abstract": "           Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is a powerful non-invasive imaging technique for high-resolution assessment of tissue elasticity and viscoelasticity. Accurate characterization of viscoelastic properties requires estimating shear wave speed (SWS) across multiple frequencies, as dispersion induces frequency-dependent variations in wave speed. This study introduces a novel multi-frequency reverberant OCE (MFR-OCE) approach to enhance viscoelastic tissue characterization by simultaneously capturing shear wave dynamics over multiple frequencies. We present the theoretical framework, experimental setup, and validation of MFR-OCE through simulations and experiments on gelatin phantoms, ex vivo porcine cornea, and ex vivo bovine liver. Simulation results demonstrate that MFR-OCE estimates SWS with errors below 4% relative to ground truth, and phantom experimental results show that MFR-OCE and single-frequency OCE also yield closely matching SWS estimates, with differences below 3%. Furthermore, the frequency-dependent dispersion coefficients extracted from biological tissues and phantoms align with the theoretical viscoelastic power law model. The gelatin phantoms exhibit a low viscoelastic behavior with an exponent of 0.13 for the power law fit of SWS, while the ex vivo porcine cornea demonstrates intermediate viscoelastic behavior, with a power law exponent of 0.33. The liver tissue shows significant frequency dependence, with a power law exponent of 0.51. These findings demonstrate that MFR-OCE enables a more comprehensive understanding of tissue mechanics and holds the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy in clinical applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           This study proposes a systematic image registration approach to align 2D optical thin-section images within a 3D digital rock volume. Using template image matching with differential evolution optimization, we identify the most similar 2D plane in 3D. The method is validated on a synthetic porous medium, achieving exact registration, and applied to Berea sandstone, where it achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.990. With the registered images, we explore upscaling properties based on paired multimodal images, focusing on pore characteristics and effective elastic moduli. The thin-section image reveals 50 % more porosity and submicron pores than the registered CT plane. In addition, bulk and shear moduli from thin sections are 25 % and 30 % lower, respectively, than those derived from CT images. Beyond numerical comparisons, thin sections provide additional geological insights, including cementation, mineral phases, and weathering effects, which are not clear in CT images. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal image registration to improve computed rock properties in digital rock physics by integrating complementary imaging modalities.         ",

    "abstract": "           We propose an end-to-end integrated strategy to produce highly accurate quantum chemistry (QC) synthetic datasets (energies and forces) aimed at deriving Foundation Machine Learning models for molecular simulation. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT), a \"Jacob's Ladder\" approach leverages computationally-optimized layers of massively parallel GPU-accelerated software with increasing accuracy. Thanks to Exascale, this is the first time that the computationally intensive calculation of Diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) forces, and the combination of multi-determinant QMC energies and forces with selected-CI wavefunctions, are computed at such scale at the complete basis-set-limit. To bridge the gap between accurate QC and condensed-phase molecular dynamics, we leverage transfer learning to improve the FeNNix-Bio1 DFT-based foundation model. The resulting approach is coupled to path integrals adaptive sampling quantum dynamics to perform nanosecond reactive simulations at unprecedented accuracy. These results demonstrate the promise of Exascale to deepen our understanding of the inner machinery of complex biosystems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Strong coupling between vacuum fields and quantum matter occurs at the nanoscale and broadens the horizon of light-matter interaction. Nanoscale Casimir force, as an exhibition of vacuum fields, inevitably experiences the influence of surface electrons due to their quantum character, which are ignorable in micron Casimir force. Here, we develop a three-dimensional conformal map method to tackle typical experimental configurations with surface electron contributions to Casimir force purposely and delicately included. Based on this method, we reveal that surface electrons can either enhance or suppress the nanoscale Casimir force, depending on materials and crystal facets. The mechanism is demonstrated to be the Casimir force softening, which results from surface electrons effectively altering the distance seen by the Casimir interaction. Our findings not only highlight the interaction between surface electrons and vacuum fields but also provide a recipe for theoretical and experimental investigation of nanoscale fluctuation-type problems.
