    "title": "Adaptation of quantum models to economic growth theories",
    "abstract": "           Traditional economic growth theories, grounded in deterministic and often linear frameworks, fail to adequately capture the inherent uncertainty, non-commutativity, and complex interdependencies of modern economies. This paper proposes a novel approach by transposing fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics-such as superposition, operator algebra, and path integrals-into the realm of macroeconomic modeling. Within this quantum framework, core economic variables (capital, labor, and technological progress) are redefined as non-commuting operators acting on Hilbert spaces, and the state of the economy is represented as a dynamic wave function governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The evolution of this economic wave function follows a generalized Schr{\u00f6}dinger equation, developed here through Dyson series and Magnus expansions. We also define a quantum production function as the expected value of a composite operator, capturing the probabilistic nature of economic output. By integrating uncertainty relations analogous to Heisenberg's principle, and modeling economic fluctuations via Langevin dynamics, we extend the model to include dissipation, feedback loops, and non-linear interactions between variables. Finally, a Feynman path integral formalism is constructed to provide an alternative trajectory-based interpretation of economic dynamics. This quantum-inspired framework offers a rigorous and flexible methodology to rethink macroeconomic modeling under radical uncertainty, with potential applications in dynamic policy simulations and innovation-driven growth.

    "abstract": "           Here, we introduce the Directional Quantum Evolution Theory (DQET), a covariant reformulation of quantum mechanics where evolution takes place along a four-vector-defined arbitrary timelike direction. This method restores space-time symmetry and provides a geometric interpretation of energy as a frame-dependent projection by substituting a directional derivative for the traditional time derivative. DQET establishes a conserved probability current, supports proper-time evolution, and recovers the Schrodinger in suitable bounds. It provides a covariant solution to the quantum twin conundrum and predicts observable phase discrepancies between systems traveling along distinct trajectories. With encouraging extensions to curved spacetime, the theory offers a cohesive framework for relativistic quantum evolution.         ",

Photonic logic gates are of crucial importance due to the fundamental role of Boolean logic in modern digital computing systems. However, most photonic logic schemes struggle to exhibit the capability of massively parallel processing and flexible reconfiguration, owing to weak and fixed nonlinearity in optical elements. Here, we propose a photonic logic tensor computing architecture for the first time and fabricate the photonic universal logic tensor core (PULTC) with a parallel logic computing capacity beyond TOPS. Ten wavelength channels and four spatial channels are designed in PULTC, where the logic computing speed in each channel can reach 50 Gbit/s. After the nonlinear mapping of microring modulators, arbitrary logic operations can be achieved by configuring the Mach-Zehnder interferometer mesh. Our work offers an innovative route for photonic universal logic computing with high-parallel capability and propels the practical applications of photonic logic computing.         ",

    "title": "Large-scale artificial intelligence with 41 million nanophotonic neurons on a metasurface",
    "abstract": "           Conventional integrated circuits (ICs) struggle to meet the escalating demands of artificial intelligence (AI). This has sparked a renewed interest in an unconventional computing paradigm: neuromorphic (brain-inspired) computing. However, current neuromorphic systems face significant challenges in delivering a large number of parameters (i.e., weights) required for large-scale AI models. As a result, most neuromorphic hardware is limited to basic benchmark demonstrations, hindering its application to real-world AI challenges. Here, we present a large-scale optical neural network (ONN) for machine learning acceleration, featuring over 41 million photonic neurons. This system not only surpasses digital electronics in speed and energy efficiency but more importantly, closes the performance gap with large-scale AI models. Our ONN leverages an innovative optical metasurface device featuring numerous spatial modes. This device integrates over 41 million meta-atoms on a 10 mm$^2$ metasurface chip, enabling the processing of tens of millions of weights in a single operation. For the first time, we demonstrate that an ONN, utilizing a single-layer metasurface, can match the performance of deep and large-scale deep learning models, such as ResNet and Vision Transformer, across various benchmark tasks. Additionally, we show that our system can deliver high-performance solutions to real-world AI challenges through its unprecedented scale, such as accelerating the analysis of multi-gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) for cancer detection by processing the million-pixel sub-image in a single shot. Our system reduces computing time and energy consumption by over 1,000 times compared to state-of-the-art graphic processing units (GPUs). This work presents a large-scale, low-power, and high-performance neuromorphic computing system, paving the way for future disruptive AI technologies.         ",

    "abstract": "           Optically-levitated nanoparticles in vacuum offer a pristine platform for high-quality mechanical oscillators, enabling a wide range of precision measurements and quantum technologies. A key performance metric in such systems is the stiffness of the optical trap, which is typically enhanced by increasing laser power-at the cost of unwanted heating, reduced coherence, and enhanced quantum backaction. Here, we demonstrate a fundamentally new route to increasing trap stiffness: wavefront shaping of the optical field. By tailoring the spatial phase profile of the trapping beam, we significantly boost the mechanical confinement of subwavelength particles without raising the optical intensity. Remarkably, this enhancement arises from a selective reduction of non-conservative optical forces, while preserving the conservative restoring forces that define trap stiffness. As a result, mechanical nonlinearities are also reduced, improving stability at low pressures. Our findings challenge the long-standing assumption that diffraction-limited focusing is optimal for dipolar Rayleigh particles, and establish wavefront shaping as a powerful, readily applicable tool to control optomechanical forces in levitation experiments. This opens new avenues for minimizing backaction, reducing thermal decoherence, and expanding the range of materials that can be stably levitated.         ",

Several simple models implying mixing of Zeeman sublevels of the excited state are considered, and common patterns among them are identified. It is shown that in the general case the properties of the medium causing dichroism can be characterized by only two parameters, {\\Delta}x and {\\Delta}y, while in the case of complete mixing - by a single parameter {\\Delta}. Expressions that relate these parameters to the transition probabilities are provided, as is an extension of the theory for the case of incomplete mixing of sublevels of the excited state. The single-beam scheme for recording linear dichroism signals, which is of greatest interest from a practical point of view, is investigated. It is shown that incomplete mixing can lead to inversion of dichroism signals in systems including more than one optical transition.

    "abstract": "           In all standard force field-based simulations of organic, bio-molecules, polymers; the torsion angle based Hamiltonian has been an indispensable term to set up molecular simulation. Torsion often termed as a dihedral angle, the coordinate assumes a continuous molecular geometry and energy changes for an angle range from 0 to 360 degrees. However, quantum mechanics-based results presented earlier and in this report show electronic energy will have singularities due to molecular geometry criticality, and torsion based electrotonic energy is not a smooth function of (r, theta) due to bond-breaking geometry. Contrast to force field or molecular mechanics based results of geometrical and energy continuity, continuum of geometry under torsion is not feasible as per quantum mechanical electronic energy computations. This feature of electronic energy is readily observed for weakly H-bonded and VDW dimers. Applying the ab initio methods of Hartree-Fock, Density Functional as well as Moller-Plesset, we have reconfirmed the previous general predictions of electronic energy singularities with torsion angle variation around weak H-bond equilibrium and beyond for water dimer. Due to the quantum nature of the weak chemical bond breaking process leading to break-point conditions in molecules, the singularities in electronic energy is observed contrast to molecular mechanics results. These overlooked results of quantum energy singularities can be useful to improve the current bio-molecular force field and reaction chemistry dynamics involving bond-breaking process.

Inertial sensors using gram-scale high mechanical Q factor (Q) glass resonators combined with compact interferometric readout are promising alternatives to kilogram-scale conventional inertial sensors. We have produced fused silica resonators suitable for low frequency inertial sensing and demonstrated that Qs of over 150,000 are possible. One resonator we produced was combined with a homodyne quadrature interferometer (HoQI) to read out the test mass displacement to form an inertial sensor. This is the first time a HoQI was used with a high Q resonator. The resulting sensor was tested against other commercial, kilogram scale inertial sensors at the AEI 10\\,m Prototype facility. Despite the dynamic range challenges induced by the test mass motion, we can match the excellent noise floors HoQIs have achieved so far with slow-moving or stationary test masses, showing HoQIs as an excellent candidate for the readout of such sensors. We evaluate the setup as an inertial sensor, showing the best performance demonstrated by any gram-scale sensor to date, with comparable sensitivity to the significantly bulkier sensors used in gravitational wave detectors today. These sensors' compact size, self-calibration, and vacuum compatibility make them ideal candidates for the inertial sensing requirements in future gravitational wave detectors.         ",

Here, we reveal the evolution of quantum information in heralded single photons as they couple into and out of the near-field of a nanophotonic system. Through quantum state tomography, we discover that the TAM qubit in the near-field becomes a free-space qudit entangled in the photonic SAM and OAM. The extracted density matrix and Wigner function in free-space indicate state preparation fidelity above 97%. The concepts described here bring new concepts and methodologies in developing high-dimensional quantum circuitry on a chip.         ",

    "abstract": "           This work sets out to answer a single question: what is the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics? However, we adopt a different approach to that normally used. Rather than carefully surveying the precise details of the thoughts of Bohr and Heisenberg, we extract an orthodoxy empirically. To do this we review a collection of 33 textbooks on quantum mechanics, encompassing the most popular and prominent works of this nature. We then gauge their response to 12 propositions to build up a picture of exactly what is believed by an orthodox quantum mechanic. We demonstrate that this orthodoxy is largely unchanged over the past century, with some interesting emerging deviations, and has many aspects of Copenhagen-like viewpoints. However, it is more nuanced than some reductive characterisations that condense it down to the ontological primacy of the quantum state. The revealed orthodoxy has two main pillars: measurement inherently disturbs quantum states and these states refer to individual instances, not ensembles. More fully it entails that individual particles exist in wave-like super-positions and present particle behaviours only when forced to by outside influences. The act of measuring such a system inherently changes its state in a random fashion, manifesting in a form of measurement error that corresponds to the uncertainty principle. This implies that measurement does not reveal underlying values of quantum properties.         ",

We show how to instead solve this problem with a reciprocity technique which leads to three orders of magnitude speedup: one Maxwell solve (using any numerical technique) instead of thousands. This improvement enables us to perform efficient inverse design, large scale optimization of the metasurface for applications such as light collimators and concentrators. We show the impact of the angular distribution of incident light on the resulting performance, and show especially promising designs for the case of \"annular\" beams distributed only over nonzero angles.

Usually, it is required to run the quantum experiment - state preparation, state evolution, measurement - several times to be able to estimate the output quantum state of the experiment, because an exponentially high number of copies of the state is required. In this work, we present an efficient algorithm to estimate with a small but non-zero probability of error the output state of the experiment using a single copy of the state, without knowing the evolution dynamics of the state. It also does not destroy the original state, which can be recovered easily for any further quantum processing. As an example, it is usually required to repeat a quantum image processing experiment many times, since many copies of the state of the output image are needed to extract the information from all its pixels. The information from $\\mathcal{N}$ pixels of the image can be inferred from a single run of the image processing experiment in our algorithm, to efficiently estimate the density matrix of the image state.

    "abstract": "           All-optical helicity-dependent magnetization switching (AO-HDS) is the quickest data recording technique using only ultrashort laser pulses. FePt grains provide an ideal platform for examining the interaction of effects conducting magnetization switching. We identify the magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) as the primary switching forces. Ultrafast photon absorption rapidly elevates electron temperatures, quenching magnetization. The MCD's helicity-dependent absorption ensures distinct electron temperatures, holding a finite switching probability by generating different spin noise rates in each spin channel. The IFE induces a magnetic moment, enhancing this probability. We present ultrashort laser pulse (<200 fs) AO-HDS experiments in the near-infrared spectral range from 800 nm to 1500 nm, demonstrating a correlation between switching efficiency and absorbed energy density. Elevating electron temperatures to the Curie point enables the IFE to induce a magnetic moment for deterministic switching in the quenched magnetization state. Unlike in films or multilayers, where domain wall motion and domain growth govern the switching process, increasing the MCD in nanometer-sized grains does not enhance switching efficiency. Electrons around the Curie temperature typically reach increased switching rates for higher induced magnetization generated by the IFE. The MCD sets the necessary switching condition, separating electron temperatures. The IFE generates a magnetic moment, directing spins toward the desired orientation and improving switching efficiency. Every laser pulse initiates a new switching probability for each grain, increasing the role of direction indication by the IFE. Stronger absorption assures higher induced magnetization at low switching fluences.         ",

We analyse a simple trapping geometry of standing wave patterns created by opposite helical light waves. We uncover stable rotation of particles in both nodes and anti-nodes, and also study how specific particle properties influence the resonant optical torque. We demonstrate that adjusting particle losses can maximize spinning torque, and we predict \"super-torque\" originating from the superabsorption effect at resonances.

The proposed ECM maintains accuracy across varying design parameters including dual-polarization, arbitrary obliquity and azimuthal rotation of incidence plane, as well as physical dimensions of the lumped elements. Our approach is built incrementally, starting from an elementary unit cell which is extended to a 2-by-2 arrangement that allows for multifunctionality and reconfigurability in both polarizations, independently. These capabilities facilitate the design of tunable holographic metasurfaces which can implement reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for advanced wireless communication systems. We evaluate the limitations and accuracy of the proposed ECM with full-wave simulations (FWS), which evidence robustness up to 45 degrees and thus highlight its aptitude as a rapid design tool or a guide for FWS-based optimization.

    "abstract": "           On-chip quantum sources based on nonlinear processes are pivotal components in integrated photonics, driving significant advancements in quantum information technologies over recent decades. Usually, the pump coherence has been considered to be crucial for ensuring the quality of generated states, therefore incoherent light is rarely used in quantum information processing. In this work, we explore and reveal the constructive influence of pumped temporal incoherence on the quantum properties of photon sources. Taking silicon waveguides as nonlinear media, we theoretically show that temporal incoherence of light can improve pumping utilization efficiency, resulting in higher source brightness in a spontaneous four-wave mixing process, and the spectrally uncorrelated nature of incoherent light is transferred to the generated photon source, allowing high-purity state preparation. Experimentally, we obtain a higher photon pair generation rate and the lower heralded second-order autocorrelation with an Amplified Spontaneous Emission source. Additionally, we successfully generate a polarization-entangled state with Bell inequality violation of S = 2.64 and a fidelity of 95.7%. Our study reveals the mechanism behind incoherently pumped quantum states and presents a method for generating photon sources using an easily accessible incoherent light.         ",

A near-unity degree of polarization entanglement is essential to minimize qubit error rates in key distribution. This study theoretically investigates the polarization entangled photon pairs produced by a quantum-dot radiative cascade located within a micropillar cavity. To incorporate the unavoidable exciton-phonon coupling in a quantum dot-cavity system, we develop a polaron master equation theory and investigate how it affects the degree of entanglement and qubit error rate. We derive analytical expressions of various phonon-induced incoherent rates and demonstrate that one-photon incoherent rates predominate, substantially diminishing the degree of entanglement. It is shown that at elevated temperatures, the role of cavity-mediated effects such as cross-coupling between exciton states, ac-Stark shift, and multiphoton emission gets reduced owing to the phonon-mediated renormalization of the cavity coupling and Rabi frequency. Finally, we consider a BBM92 quantum key distribution protocol and show the evolution of qubit error rate at elevated temperatures of the phonon bath.         ",

Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.
