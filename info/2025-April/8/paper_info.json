    "abstract": "           Through left- or right-handed twisting, we investigate the impact of mirror-asymmetry (chirality) of the conducting boundary conditions of an equilaterial triangular cross-section electromagnetic resonator. We observe the generation of eigenmodes with non-zero electromagnetic helicity as a result of the coupling of near degenerate TE$_{11(p+1)}$ and TM$_{11p}$ modes. This can be interpreted as an emergence of magneto-electric coupling, which in turn produces a measurable shift in resonant mode frequency as a function of twist angle. We show that this coupling mechanism is equivalent to introducing a non-zero chirality material parameter $\\kappa_\\text{eff}$ or axion field $\\theta_{\\text{eff}}$ to the medium. Our findings demonstrate the potential for real-time, macroscopic manipulation of electromagnetic helicity.         ",

    "abstract": "           This paper is the first work to redesign a spherical ICF implosion to best utilize the benefits of applying an external magnetic field. The sub-ignition experiment N170601 is taken as the baseline design, which used 1.57MJ of laser energy. The optimum magnetized design benefits from increasing the shell thickness by 14$\\mu$m and decreasing the ice thickness by 18$\\mu$m, resulting in a neutron yield of 8.9$\\times$10$^{17}$. This is 34$\\times$ greater than the unmagnetized simulation of the same design, and 18.5$\\times$ the greatest unmagnetized simulation across all designs simulated. The resultant implosion velocity for the magnetized design is lower, which would also reduce ablation front instability growth. This design was found by using a simplified 1D magnetization model, then validated against full 2D extended-MHD capsule simulations with radiation asymmetries applied to correct the shape.         ",

Despite their potential, the development of deep AONNs is constrained by the high optical power demands of conventional nonlinear optical processes, which limits scalability. This work introduces a novel low-power nonlinear optical activation function scheme based on a three-level quantum medium driven by two laser fields. Unlike traditional single-input, single-output activations, our design offers two-port optical nonlinear activation functions with both self- and cross-nonlinearities, making them great candidates for multi-input, multi-output networks. The approach allows precise control of nonlinear optical behavior, achieving sigmoid and rectified linear unit (ReLU)functions at ultralow power levels (~ 17 uW per neuron). Our theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of constructing large-scale, deep AONNs with millions of neurons powered by less than 100 W of optical power. This advancement represents a significant step toward scalable, high-speed, and energy-efficient AONNs for next-generation AI hardware.         ",

Yet, the state space of strongly coupled KPO networks is very involved. As such, their phase diagram sometimes features either too few or too many states, including some that cannot be mapped to Ising spin configurations. This complexity makes it challenging to find and meet the conditions under which an analog optimization algorithm can be successful. Here, we demonstrate how to use three strongly coupled KPOs as a simulator for an Ising Hamiltonian, and estimate its ground state using a Boltzmann sampling measurement.

    "abstract": "           Standard apodization methods suppress side lobes but increase FWHM, reducing lateral resolution. Grating lobes can interfere with the main lobe, introducing artifacts in ultrasound images. A simple mathematical apodization function is needed to reduce side lobes while decreasing FWHM, thereby improving lateral resolution. The advantage of the new apodization function is that it performs comparably to the Hanning function in suppressing the first grating lobe while also reducing FWHM. This leads to improved lateral resolution and fewer artifacts caused by interference between side lobes and the main beam. Simulations using the new inverse quadratic apodization and no apodization were conducted with a wave pressure model. The new method was implemented using a rectangular function convoluted with the Fourier transform of an inverse quadratic. FWHM and the first side lobe amplitudes were quantified and compared across apodization functions. The inverse quadratic apodization outperformed no apodization in FWHM, with values of 0.906 mm and 1.22 mm, respectively. For first grating lobe suppression, the inverse quadratic and Hanning apodizations yielded -31.47 dB and -31 dB, respectively. Simulated B-mode wire phantom scans showed CNR values of 1.06 (no apodization), 1.32 (Hanning), and 1.66 (inverse quadratic). Corresponding image sharpness values were 7.3398, 6.6009, and 7.0039. The proposed apodization improves FWHM over rectangular and better suppresses the first side lobe than Hanning. When combined with Slepian sequences, the method yields superior CNR compared to standard apodizations, with only a slight trade-off in sharpness.         ",

    "abstract": "           In order to test the hypothesis that inverse cascade regions in turbulent flows might exhibit more Gaussian noise-like and less intermittent small-scale statistics compared to the overall statistics, in this work we measure degrees of small-scale intermittency separately in regions of forward and inverse cascade. The local energy cascade rate $(\\Phi_\\ell)$ at length scale $(\\ell)$ is defined using the scale-integrated Kolmogorov-Hill (KH) equation. To characterize intermittency, we analyze the probability density functions (PDFs) of longitudinal and transverse velocity increments at scale $\\ell$, conditioned on positive and negative $\\Phi_\\ell$ (local forward and inverse cascades). Our findings reveal that transverse velocity increments display approximately the same degree of non-Gaussianity and intermittency, in both forward or inverse cascade regions. The only noticeable difference is observed for longitudinal velocity increments that display strong negative skewness in regions of forward cascade compared to small positive skewness in regions of inverse cascade. We repeat the analysis for filtered velocity gradient tensor elements at scale $\\ell$ and obtain similar results, except that the skewness of its longitudinal elements is slightly negative even in regions of inverse cascade. The analysis is based on isotropic turbulence data ($Re_\\lambda \\sim 1{,}250$) available from the public Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases, JHTDB v2.0. This refactored system is based on the Zarr storage format, while data access is based on the ``virtual sensor'' approach, enabled by a Python backend package (Giverny) that replaces the legacy SQL storage and SOAP Web Services-based approaches.

However, the image data is in the form of a raster, the distance will affect the pixel size. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the distance of the camera measurement to the object. The time-of-flight (ToF) method with a lidar sensor is used to calculate the distance of the camera to the object. It is necessary to calculate the ratio of the distance to the number of pixels obtained so that the value is always consistent. This study analyzed the use of appropriate ratios and regression systems on a webcam and a lidar sensor for measuring wound dimensions.

One such application is photon-pair generation in waveguides with second-order non-linearity. The spectral properties of the generated photon pairs are governed by the effective group refractive indices of the interacting modes, which normally are calculated via Sellmeier's equations for bulk crystals. However, in integrated optics, the effective group refractive indices experienced by the propagating modes can differ from those in bulk materials. Therefore, we present an accurate, in-situ measurement technique for determining the birefringence characteristics of a structure with high reflective end facets by performing a Fourier transformation of the light transmission spectrum and apply this method to a periodically-poled Lithium Niobate waveguide resonator in the telecom wavelength range.

Furthermore, interference breaks some of the symmetries arising from the field. We detangle the superimposed interference fringes originating from phase differences related to symmetrization due to electron exchange, temporal shifts and a combination of exchange and event interference. We show that the hierarchy between exchange-only and exchange-temporal interference is fluid and can be manipulated by an appropriate choice of driving-field parameters.

In photonic crystal slabs, far-field emission from guided resonances naturally provides a non-invasive way to probe the embedded wavefunctions, raising the question of how the information carried by escaping photons relates to the band topology. We develop a non-Hermitian model to describe the guided and leaky modes of photonic crystal slabs with long-range couplings and non-local responses. Within this framework, radiation Berry curvature is defined from the far-field polarization and compared to the conventional bulk Berry curvature of the crystal Bloch modes. We investigate this bulk-radiation correspondence in the vicinity of the $\\Gamma$-point of the square lattice and the $K$-point of the honeycomb lattice. The results show that the comparability between the bulk topology and the radiation topology is not universal; the validity is contingent upon the specific bulk Bloch states. Notably, the correspondence completely breaks down surrounding the far-field singularities, while it can hold in smooth regions under special symmetry conditions, e.g., rotational symmetry. Besides, net Berry curvature concentration is captured at the valleys of the non-local honeycomb lattice, facilitating further exploration on generalized topological phases in photonic lattices beyond the regimes with localized couplings and Hermiticity.

However, conventional THz imaging systems face limitations such as slow mechanical scanning, restricted field of view, and poor telecentricity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Telecentric Offset Reflective Imaging System (TORIS), a novel dual-mirror scanning design optimized for high-speed, distortion-free imaging. The system employs a telecentric f-theta lens and is validated using ray tracing and physical optics simulations. It achieves uniform resolution across a 50 mm x 50 mm field of view without the need for mechanical translation stages. Broadband spectral imaging of a USAF resolution test target across WR-2.2 (325-500 GHz) and WR-1.5 (500-700 GHz) frequency bands demonstrates consistent beam focus and minimal distortion, with a maximum deviation of 2.7 degrees from normal incidence and a beam waist of 2.1 lambda at the field edge in the WR-1.5 band. The system's sensitivity to hydration dynamics is further validated through imaging of wet tissue paper, capturing temporal changes in water content. In vivo imaging of human skin after capsaicin patch application reveals localized hydration variations due to biochemical response and adhesive removal. These findings confirm the system's potential for real-time hydration sensing and dermatological evaluation.

    "abstract": "           Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols most often use two conjugate bases in order to verify the security of the quantum channel. In the majority of protocols, these bases are mutually unbiased to one another, which is to say they are formed from balanced superpositions of the entire set of states in the opposing basis. Here, we introduce a high-dimensional QKD protocol using qubit-like states, referred to as Fourier-qubits (or $\\textit{F}$-qubits). In our scheme, each $\\textit{F}$-qubit is a superposition of only two computational basis states with a relative phase that can take $d$ distinct values, where $d$ is the dimension of the computational basis. This non-mutually unbiased approach allows us to bound the information leaked to an eavesdropper, maintaining security in high-dimensional quantum systems despite the states' seemingly two-dimensional nature. By simplifying state preparation and measurement, our protocol offers a practical alternative for secure high-dimensional quantum communications. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol for a noisy high-dimensional QKD channel using the orbital angular momentum degree of freedom of light and discuss the potential benefits for encoding in other degrees of freedom.

    "abstract": "           Quantum dots (QDs) are nanoscale materials that exhibit unique electronic and optical properties due to quantum confinement effects, making them highly relevant for applications in catalysis, optoelectronics, and energy conversion. While transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) QDs have been extensively studied in their pristine forms, Janus-type TMD QDs -- featuring compositional asymmetry across their atomic layers -- offer an additional degree of tunability through charge-density gradients and curvature effects, yet remain comparatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the electronic and structural properties of Janus TMD QDs composed of molybdenum (Mo) or tungsten (W) in combination with chalcogen elements (S, Se, Te) and oxygen, exploring three distinct structural classes: pristine, non-oxidized Janus, and oxidized Janus phases. Using first-principles calculations, including static DFT and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we analyze curvature evolution, electrostatic potential isosurfaces, charge-density asymmetry, and surface formation energies to assess size- and composition-dependent stability. Our findings reveal that oxidation induces significant curvature and charge localization, particularly in W-based systems, enhancing their potential as catalysts for hydrodesulfurization reactions. Additionally, we identify size- and geometry-dependent stability trends, with larger and beta-type QDs exhibiting superior thermodynamic and thermal robustness. These results provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the design and synthesis of structurally tunable Janus QDs with tailored properties for catalytic and electronic applications.

We use the simple update of projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) in the Vidal gauge to simulate the states of random quantum circuits (RQCs), which center around recent quantum advantage claims.

    "abstract": "           The breakdown of conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, a cornerstone of topological physics, is one of counter-intuitive phenomena in non-Hermitian systems, that is deeply rooted in symmetry. In particular, preserved chiral symmetry is one of the key ingredients, which plays a pivotal role in determining non-Hermitian topology. Nevertheless, chiral symmetry breaking in non-Hermitian systems disrupts topological protection, modifies topological invariants, and substantially reshapes spectral and edge-state behavior. The corresponding fundamentally important bulk-boundary correspondence thus needs to be drastically reconstructed. However, it has so far eluded experimental efforts. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence of a one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian system with chiral symmetry breaking in discrete-time non-chiral non-unitary quantum walks of single photons. Through constructing a domain-wall configuration, we experimentally observe the photon localization at the interface of domain-wall structure, clearly indicating the presence of the topological edge mode. The appearance of that matches excellently with the prediction of our introduced non-chiral non-Bloch topological invariants pair. Our work thus unequivocally builds the non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence as a general principle for studying topological physics in non-Hermitian systems with chiral symmetry breaking.

    "abstract": "           A frequency shifter of the photon is a key component for frequency-multiplexed high-capacity quantum communications and frequency-encoded quantum computation. Existed methods for shifting the frequency of a photon based on electro-optical, or acousto-optical effect, however, suffer the limited frequency shift up to a few hundreds of GHz, furthermore, high-quality micro-wave electronics are required. The frequency of a photon can also be shifted with the frequency difference equal to the frequency of pump laser by using an all optical-wave-mixing approach, which is usually about tens of THz. So, there is a big frequency shifting gap between these methods. Here, we propose a new scheme of a quantum frequency shifter based on an all-optical wave-mixing process, which can theoretically achieve a frequency shift ranging from GHz to a few THz, therefore bridging the gap. As a principle of poof, by using two pump beams in a three-wave mixing cascading process, a heralded single photon is frequency-shifted more than 400GHz, and the shift can be tuned continuously over broadband by changing the frequency difference between two pump lasers. Besides, high coincidence to accidence ratio between the shifted photons and the heralded photon indicates the preserve of quantum properties. The present quantum frequency shifter is in analog to an electro-optical based shifter, but with much broader tuning ability. Our all-optical quantum frequency shifter will become a fundamental building block for high-speed quantum communication networks and frequency domain photonic quantum computation.         ",

These multiple translation paths are added in a coherent way, which makes the walker evolve under the topological band. Therein, not only the fast diffusion speed is expected, but more importantly, we find that single quantum gate operations can be performed in the quasi-momentum space. In particular, we show the arbitrary single-qubit state preparation and an example of CNOT two-qubit gate with only one time step, dramarically increasing quantum algorithms.

    "abstract": "           Rapid single shot spin readout is a key ingredient for fault tolerant quantum computing with spin qubits. An RF-SET (radio-frequency single electron transistor) is predominantly used as its the readout timescale is far shorter than the spin decoherence time. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a transmission-based RF-SET using a multi-module semiconductor-superconductor assembly. A monolithically integrated SET placed next to a double quantum dot in a Si/SiGe heterostructure is wire-bonded to a superconducting niobium inductor forming the impedance-transforming network. Compared to RF reflectometry, the proposed set-up is experimentally simpler without the need for directional couplers. Read-out performance is benchmarked by the signal-to-noise (SNR) of a dot-reservoir transition (DRT) and an interdot charge transition (ICT) in the double quantum dot near the SET as a function of RF power and integration time. The minimum integration time for unitary SNR is found to be 100 ns for ICT and 300 ns for DRT. The obtained minimum integration times are comparable to the state of the art in conventional RF reflectometry set-ups. Furthermore, we study the turn-on properties of the RF-SET to investigate capacitive shifts and RF losses. Understanding these effects are crucial for further optimisations of the impedance transforming network as well as the device design to assist RF read-out. This new RF read-out scheme also shows promise for multiplexing spin-qubit readout and further studies on rapid charge dynamics in quantum dots.         ",

However, modern-day photonic computing strategies are predominantly analog, making them susceptible to noise and intrinsically difficult to scale. The optical Skyrmion offers a route to overcoming these limitations through digitization in the form of a discrete topological number that can be assigned to the analog optical field. Apart from an intrinsic robustness against perturbations, optical Skyrmions represent a new dimension that has yet to be exploited for photonic computing, namely spatially varying polarization. Here, we propose a method of performing perturbation-resilient integer arithmetic with this new dimension of optical Skyrmions through passive optical components and present experimental evidence demonstrating its feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such discrete mathematical operations have been directly achieved using optical Skyrmions without external energy input.         ",

The knock-on deuteron imager (KoDI) was developed at the Omega Laser Facility to image these particles in order to diagnose low-mode asymmetries in the hot-spot and dense fuel layer of cryogenic deuterium--tritium ICF implosions. However, the images collected are distorted in several ways that prevent reconstruction of the deuteron source. In this paper we describe these distortions and a series of attempts to mitigate or compensate for them. We present several potential mechanisms for the distortions, including a new model for scattering of charged particles in filamentary electric or magnetic fields surrounding the implosion. Particle-tracing is used to create synthetic KoDI data based on the filamentary field model that reproduces the main experimentally observed image distortions. We conclude that the filamentary scattering model best matches the observed image distortions. Finally, we discuss potential impacts of filamentary fields on other charged-particle diagnostics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Terahertz (THz) metalens antennas with compact planar structures have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing gain and aperture efficiency through beam convergence. However, research on THz wireless communication systems utilizing metalens antennas remains limited, primarily due to insufficient collaborative enhancement in gain and bandwidth in THz transceiver design. In this paper, we propose a high gain metalens antenna transceiver and demonstrate its application for THz communication. The system employs a horn antenna integrated with a 3D-printed bracket to enhance the metalens gain and operating bandwidth, where the metalens adopts a \"sandwich\" architecture composed of a V-shaped copper resonator, a dielectric substrate, and a grating. The resonant design inside the metalens facilitates high polarization conversion efficiency and full phase modulation across a 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 range at frequency between 0.20 to 0.30 THz band. Experimental results demonstrate a peak gain of 36.1 dBi and aperture efficiency of 54.45% at 0.244 THz, with a 3 dB bandwidth exceeding 33 GHz. A prototype communication system incorporating the metalens transceiver achieves a bit error rate (BER) reduction by three orders of magnitude compared to conventional horn antennas and supports a maximum data rate of 100 Gbps. This proposed metalens offer a high-gain, compact solution for achieving high data rate THz communications, driving advancements in 6G communication network.         ",

    "abstract": "           The silicon vacancy center in Silicon Carbide (SiC) provides an optically addressable qubit at room temperature in its spin-$\\frac{3}{2}$ electronic state. However, optical spin initialization and readout are less efficient compared to those of spin-1 systems, such as nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, under non-resonant optical excitation. Spin-dependent fluorescence exhibits contrast only between $|m=\\pm 3/2\\rangle$ and $|m=\\pm 1/2\\rangle$ states, and optical pumping does not create a population difference between $|+1/2\\rangle$ and $|-1/2\\rangle$ states. Thus, operating one qubit (e.g., $\\left\\{|+3/2\\rangle, |+1/2\\rangle \\right\\}$ states) leaves the population in the remaining state ($|-1/2\\rangle$) unaffected, contributing to background in optical readout. To mitigate this problem, we propose a sensing scheme based on duplex qubit operation in the quartet, using microwave pulses with two resonant frequencies to simultaneously operate $\\left\\{ |+3/2\\rangle, |+1/2\\rangle \\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{ |-1/2\\rangle, |-3/2\\rangle \\right\\}$. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach doubles signal contrast in optical readout and improves sensitivity in AC magnetometry compared to simplex operation.         ",

We prove an inverse relationship between entanglement entropy and sensitivity for measurements of single-mode phase shifts in multimode systems and for phase shifts on both modes in two-mode systems. In the two-mode case, which models devices such as interferometers, we find that entanglement strongly degrades differential phase sensitivity. Finally, we show that minimizing entanglement between paths maximizes the phase sensitivity of $N$-mode systems with zero-mean Gaussian state inputs.         ",

Here, we demonstrate that a dinickel complex (Ni$_2$) traps and quantizes classical visible light, behaving as an individual quantum system or the Jaynes Cummings this http URL composite system forms through coherently coupling the two level NiNi charge transfer transition with the local scattering field, which produces nonclassical light featuring photon anti bunching and squeezed states, as verified by a sequence of discrete photonic modes in the incoherent resonance fluorescence. Notably, in this Ni$_2$ system, the collective coupling of N molecule ensembles scales as N, distinct from the Tavis-Cummings model, which allows easy achievement of ultrastrong coupling. This is exemplified by a vacuum Rabi splitting of 1.2 eV at the resonance (3.25 eV) and a normalized coupling rate of 0.18 for the N = 4 ensemble. The resulting quantum light of single photonic modes enables driving the molecule field interaction in cavity free solution, which profoundly modifies the electronic states. Our results establish Ni$_2$ as a robust platform for quantum optical phenomena under ambient conditions, offering new pathways for molecular physics, polaritonic chemistry and quantum information processing.

    "abstract": "           In recent decades, significant progress has been made in construction and study of individual quantum systems consisting of the basic single matter and energy particles, i.e., atoms and photons, which show great potentials in quantum computation and communication. Here, we demonstrate that the quadruply-bonded Mo$_2$ unit of the complex can trap photons of visible light under ambient conditions, producing intense local electromagnetic (EM) field that features squeezed states, photon antibunching, and vacuum Rabi splitting. Our results show that both the electronic and vibrational states of the Mo$_2$ molecule are modified by coherent coupling with the scattered photons of the Mo$_2$ unit, as evidenced by the Rabi doublet4 and the Mollow triplet in the incoherent resonance fluorescence and the Raman spectra. The Mo$_2$ molecule, acting as an independent emitter-resonator integrated quantum system, allows optical experiments to be conducted in free space, enabling fundamental quantum phenomena to be observed through conventional spectroscopic instrumentation. This provides a new platform for study of field effects and quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the optical domain. The insights gained from this study advance our understanding in metal-metal bond chemistry, molecular physics and quantum optics, with applications in quantum information processing, optoelectronic devices and control of chemical reactivity.

The performance of the hydrophone was evaluated through laboratory tests and experiments in an anechoic basin, where its transfer function was measured before and after a 140-bar pressure cycle. The results show that the hydrophone maintains its sensitivity, with resonance peaks identified in both low- and high-frequency ranges.
