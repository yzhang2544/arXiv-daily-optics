    "abstract": "           In this paper we deal with the problem of overcoming the intuitive definition of several color perception attributes by replacing them with novel mathematically rigorous ones. Our framework is a quantum-like color perception theory recently developed, which constitutes a radical change of view with respect to the classical CIE models and their color appearance counterparts. We show how quantum information concepts, as e.g. effects, generalized states, post-measurement transformations and relative entropy provide tools that seem to be perfectly fit to model color perception attributes as brightness, lightness, colorfulness, chroma, saturation and hue. An illustration of the efficiency of these novel definitions is provided by the rigorous derivation of the so-called lightness constancy phenomenon.         ",

    "abstract": "           At high red-shifts, the distribution of angular separations between galaxies in clusters is in tension with the standard cosmological model. The JWST data at even higher red-shifts have exacerbated this tension. However, Zwick Tired Light (TL) model fits well with these high red shift data, bringing the TL model back into the spotlight. In the TL model, red-shift is attributed to the energy loss of photons during propagation. However, some argue that this hypothesis cannot explain the shape and primordial nature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Assuming that the CMB source is the microwave radiation from galaxies, we show that the TL model can produce a CMB spectrum consistent with the COBE FIRAS data. The TL model predicts a finite optical path per Hubble radius, which defines an opaque region, a sphere with radius of 240 Mpc (red shift 0.051) centred on the Milky Way, within this region, the galaxy's microwave radiation superposition behaves like a black body. Additionally, the TL scenario (microwave radiation superposition) allows us to determine the angular size of the CMB temperature fluctuations, in agreement with the observed CMB power spectrum, and provides insight into the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.

    "abstract": "           This study investigates ray geodesics and wave propagation on the Beltrami surface, with a particular emphasis on the effective potentials governing photon dynamics. We derive the geodesic equations and analyze the Helmholtz equation within this curved geometry, revealing that the resulting potentials are purely repulsive. For ray trajectories, the potential is determined by wormhole parameters such as the throat radius (\\(\\ell\\)), radial optical distance (\\(u\\)), scale parameter (\\(R\\)), and the angular momentum of the test field. Near the wormhole throat, the potential remains constant, preventing inward motion below a critical energy threshold, whereas at larger radial distances, it decays exponentially, allowing free propagation. In the context of wave propagation, the potential exhibits a centrifugal barrier along with a constant repulsive term at large \\(u\\). The Beltrami surface, characterized by constant negative Gaussian curvature, serves as a model for graphene sheets and optical wormholes in condensed matter systems. These results allow us to determine the space- and frequency-dependent refractive index of the medium, providing a coherent framework for understanding photon behavior in such systems, with promising implications for material applications.

    "abstract": "           We discuss a model for the relativistic bound states of 3-quark baryons based on confining quantum chromoynamics (QCD) with general Yang-Mills symmetry. The model postulates that 3-quark states are formed by consecutive 2-body collisions. For a proton, d and u quarks get together first, and then they capture another u quark so that the d quark is at the core to form a stable proton state with intergral electric charge. The two u quarks form a quantum spheric shell and move in a confining potential $C(r)= Q' r$ of the core d quark. The confining potential $C(r)$ is a static solution of new `phase' fields satisfying the fourth-order equation based on general Yang-Mills symmetry. The two u quarks with the confining potentials $C(r)$ in the spherical shell can produce an effective quark Hooke potential $V_{qH}(r)=Qr^2 + V_o$ for the d quark at the core, where Q and $Q'$ are not independent. The proton mass is assumed to be approximately given by $ E(d) + 2E(u)$, which can be obtained analytically from Dirac Hamiltonians involving $V_{qH}(r)$ and $C(r)$ for d and two u quarks respectively. The model gives a reasonable understanding of roughly 120 baryon masses based on two different coupling constants and one free parameter $V_o$ for sub-spectra specfied by $J^P$. These results are roughly within 20\\% in percent deviation, which appears to be independent of the assumption of color charges. The confining QCD model also gives the neutron-proton mass difference $\\approx 0.6 MeV$.         ",

The results indicate that semi-Dirac materials provide a versatile platform for controlling spin-dependent photonic phenomena with their material anisotropy and carrier transport.

One of the most effective methods for ensuring high frequency stability is stabilization using a high-finesse Fabry-P\u00e9rot reference cavity. However, implementing separate stabilization systems for each laser increases the complexity and size of the setup, limiting its use to laboratory conditions. An alternative approach is the use of a femtosecond optical frequency comb, which transfers the noise characteristics of a single stabilized frequency reference to other wavelengths in the optical and microwave ranges. In this work, we demonstrate a scheme for transferring frequency stability from an ultrastable laser at 871 nm to a laser at 1550 nm. Measurements using the three-cornered hat method show that the stabilized laser exhibits a fractional frequency instability of less than 4e-15 for averaging times between 0.4 and 2 s, and below 1e-14 for intervals ranging from 0.2 to 500 s. The femtosecond optical frequency comb and the cavity-stabilized laser were designed to meet compactness and portability requirements to enable field and onboard applications.         ",

By understanding the physical principles behind biological structures, we can develop materials with tailored optical properties that mimic these natural systems. One key area discussed is biomimetic materials design, where biological systems such as apple skin and the vision system inspire new materials. Another focus is on intricate optical systems based on refractive index contrast. These principles can be extended to design devices like waveguides, photonic crystals, and metamaterials, which manipulate light in novel ways. Additionally, the review covers optical scattering engineering, which is crucial for biomedical imaging. By adjusting the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index, we can control how much light is scattered and absorbed by tissues. This is particularly important for techniques like optical coherence tomography and multiphoton microscopy, where tailored scattering properties can improve imaging depth and resolution. The review also discusses various techniques for measuring the refractive index of biological tissues which provide comprehensive insights into the optical properties of biological materials, facilitating the development of advanced biomimetic designs. In conclusion, the manipulation of refractive index profiles in biological systems offers exciting opportunities for technological advancements. By drawing inspiration from nature and understanding the underlying physical principles, we can create materials and devices with enhanced performance and new functionalities. Future research should focus on further exploring these principles and translating them into practical applications to address real-world challenges.         ",

    "abstract": "           The Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method (QLBM) is one of the most promising approaches for realizing the potential of quantum computing in simulating computational fluid dynamics. Many recent works mostly focus on classical simulation, and rely on full state tomography. Several key algorithmic issues like observable readout, data encoding, and impractical circuit depth remain unsolved. As a result, these are not directly realizable on any quantum hardware. We present a series of novel algorithmic advances which allow us to implement the QLBM algorithm, for the first time, on a quantum computer. Hardware results for the time evolution of a 2D Gaussian initial density distribution subject to a uniform advection-diffusion field are presented. Furthermore, 3D simulation results are presented for particular non-uniform advection fields, devised so as to avoid the problem of diminishing probability of success due to repeated post-selection operations required for multiple timesteps. We demonstrate the evolution of an initial quantum state governed by the advection-diffusion equation, accounting for the iterative nature of the explicit QLBM algorithm. A tensor network encoding scheme is used to represent the initial condition supplied to the advection-diffusion equation, significantly reducing the two-qubit gate count affording a shorter circuit depth. Further reductions are made in the collision and streaming operators. Collectively, these advances give a path to realizing more practical, 2D and 3D QLBM applications with non-trivial velocity fields on quantum hardware.         ",

While cross-couplings from platform dynamics generally degrade quantum measurements in a complex manner, navigation filters would need to be designed to handle such complex quantum sensor data. In this work, we report on the realization of a high-fidelity model of an atom-interferometry-based gravity gradiometer and demonstrate its integration with a map-matching navigation filter. Relying on the ability of our model to simulate the sensor behaviour across various dynamic platform environments, we show that aiding navigation via map matching using quantum gravity gradiometry results in stable trajectories, and highlight the importance of non-Gaussian errors arising from platform dynamics as a key challenge to map-matching navigation. We derive requirements for mitigating these errors, such as maintaining sensor tilt below 3.3 degrees, to inform future sensor development priorities. This work demonstrates the value of an end-to-end approach that could support future optimization of the overall navigation system. Beyond navigation, our atom interferometer modelling framework could be relevant to current research and innovation endeavours with quantum gravimeters, gradiometers and inertial sensors.         ",

Real-time monitoring of the spin precession and the rf Wien filter signal allows the relative phase between the two to be stabilized at an arbitrary setpoint. The feedback system compensates for deviations in the relative phase by adjusting the frequency and/or phase as needed. With this method, a variation in phase relative to the demand phase with a standard deviation of $\\sigma_{\\Delta\\varphi}\\approx 0.2\\mathrm{rad}$ could be achieved. The system was implemented in two runs aiming at a first direct measurement of the deuteron electric dipole moment in 2018 and 2021. In addition, the difference between a single-bunch beam affected by the spin rotator and a two-bunch system in which only one bunch is exposed to the spin rotator fields is discussed. Both methods have been used during these beam times. The ability to keep the spin precession and the rf fields synchronized is also crucial for future investigations of electric dipole moments of charged particles using storage rings.         ",

    "title": "Duality Symmetry in Causality Constraints for Enhanced Acoustic Absorption",
    "abstract": "           We derive a generalized causality constraint for acoustic reflection and transmission for a flat slab with finite thickness, via the duality transformation. It is known that achieving the upper limit of the causality constraint necessitates a critical coupling condition to optimize absorption bandwidth within a specified material thickness. However, the importance of duality symmetry has been overlooked in this context. Our analytical model demonstrates that optimal absorption in a 2-port setup not only relies on the well-established critical coupling but also requires duality symmetry, defined as the invariance under duality transformation. To verify our theoretical prediction, we have experimentally realized customized metamaterials that exhibit quasi-duality symmetry. This was achieved by inducing global degeneracy between the first-order monopole and dipole resonances, consequently realizing an exceptionally large sound absorption capacity as permitted by the proposed causality constraint. Our findings elucidate the intrinsic connection between duality symmetry and scattering causality, and they facilitate the exploitation of the untapped potential in existing passive absorbers for wave transport control.

    "title": "Core-Excited States of Linear and Bent Uranyl Complexes: Insights from High-Energy Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy and Relativistic Quantum Chemistry",
    "abstract": "           Advanced X-ray spectroscopic techniques are widely recognized as state-of-the-art tools for probing the electronic structure, bonding, and chemical environments of the heaviest elements in the periodic table. In this study, we employ X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements in high-energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD-XANES) mode to investigate the core states arising from excitations out of the U 3d${_{3/2}}$ (M$_4$ edge) levels for molecular complexes in which the uranyl moiety deviates from linearity to varying degrees, and in particular systems containing the UO$_2$Cl$_2$ group such as UO$_2$Cl$_2$.n(H$_2$O) and UO$_2$Cl$_2$(phen)$_2$, which in the latter case exhibits a pronounced O-U-O bending angle. These U M$_4$ edge HERFD-XANES spectra are compared to those of other linear (Cs$_2$UO$_2$Cl$_4$) or pseudo-linear ([UO$_2$(NO$_3$)$_2$.n(H$_2$O)]) uranyl complexes. This evaluation is complemented by ab initio relativistic quantum chemistry simulations using 2-component Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) with the CAM-B3LYP functional, employing the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (2c-TDA). Our 2c-TDA simulations show modest deviations from the HERFD-XANES data, with peak splittings differing by less than 1 eV from experimental values. These core-excited states were further characterized by Natural Transition Orbital (NTO) analysis. Overall, our results highlight the influence of equatorial ligands on the spectroscopic signatures, particularly pronounced in UO$_2$Cl$_2$(phen)$_2$, where the U 3d${_{3/2}} \\rightarrow$ $5f$ $\\sigma{_u}^{*}$ satellite transition appears at lower energies compared to the other systems studied.

    "abstract": "           Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a promising platform for high-precision magnetometry. In contrast to the use of spontaneous emission in a number of NV-magnetometers, laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) exploits stimulated emission of NV centers by placing an NV-doped diamond inside an optical cavity. The NV laser system is predicted to reach a high magnetic contrast and strong coherent signal strength, leading to an improved magnetic field sensitivity combined with a high linearity. Here, we consider a two-media setup where the cavity additionally includes a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. This optically active material compensates cavity losses at 750 nm while still allowing for magnetic-field-dependent effects from the NV-diamond. We demonstrate a magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold and investigate the effects of pump laser induced absorption of the diamond. The experimental data is supported by an analytical simulation based on a rate model. Furthermore, we derive a generalized formula to compute the magnetic field sensitivity in the regime of high contrast yielding 33.79(23) pT/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ for the present setup. Simulations with an optimized diamond suggest that values down to 4.9 fT/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ are possible.         ",

    "abstract": "           We propose a novel algorithm for calculating the ground-state energy of quantum many-body systems by combining auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) with tensor-train sketching. In AFQMC, a good trial wavefunction to guide the random walk is crucial for improving the sampling efficiency and controlling the sign problem. Our proposed method iterates between determining a new trial wavefunction in the form of a tensor train, derived from the current walkers, and using this updated trial wavefunction to anchor the next phase of AFQMC. Numerical results demonstrate that the algorithm is highly accurate for large spin systems. The overlap between the estimated trial wavefunction and the ground-state wavefunction also achieves high fidelity. We additionally provide a convergence analysis, highlighting how an effective trial wavefunction can reduce the variance in the AFQMC energy estimation. From a complementary perspective, our algorithm also extends the reach of tensor-train methods for studying quantum many-body systems.         ",
