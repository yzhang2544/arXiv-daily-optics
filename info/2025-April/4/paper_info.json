    "abstract": "           We present the design, fabrication, and optical characterization of ultra-compact mid-wave infrared photodetector pixels. Our design relies on a guided mode resonance structure to confine incident mid-infrared light to the 250 nm-thick absorber region of all-epitaxially-grown material stack, and a hybrid cavity-guided mode resonance to confine the mode in the lateral direction. The resulting pixel, with deep subwavelength thickness and lateral dimensions on the order of almost two times free space operating wavelength is predicted to achieve external quantum efficiency of the order of 50%. Our work opens the door for truly compact mid-wave infrared pixels that offer the combined benefits of low dark current, room temperature operation, and small lateral size.         ",

    "abstract": "           Accurately modeling open quantum system dynamics is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, yet traditional methods struggle to balance accuracy and efficiency. Machine learning (ML) provides a promising alternative, particularly through recursive models that predict system evolution based on past history. While these models have shown success in predicting single observables, their effectiveness in more complex tasks, such as forecasting the full reduced density matrix (RDM), remains unclear. We extend history-based recursive ML approaches to complex quantum systems, comparing four physics-informed neural network (PINN) architectures: (i) single-RDM-predicting PINN (SR-PINN), (ii) SR-PINN with simulation parameters (PSR-PINN), (iii) multi-RDMs-predicting PINN (MR-PINN), and (iv) MR-PINN with simulation parameters (PMR-PINN). These models are applied to the spin-boson (SB) model and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. Our results show that SR-PINN and PSR-PINN, constrained by a narrow history window, fail to capture complex quantum evolution, leading to unstable long-term predictions, especially in nonlinear and highly correlated dynamics. In contrast, MR-PINN and PMR-PINN improve accuracy by extending the forecast horizon, incorporating long-range correlations, and reducing error propagation. Surprisingly, explicitly including simulation parameters such as temperature and reorganization energy in PSR-PINN and PMR-PINN does not consistently enhance accuracy and can even reduce performance, suggesting that these effects are already encoded in the RDM evolution. These findings highlight the limitations of short-sighted recursive forecasting and demonstrate the superior stability and accuracy of far-sighted approaches for long-term predictions.         ",

Our approach leverages the quantum-classical correspondence between TOSPDC and its reverse classical process, three-wave sum-frequency generation (TSFG), to efficiently estimate the PTG rate. We apply this framework to nonlinear metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) in the optical range. From numerical analysis of non-collinear TSFG with degenerate input waves at qBIC wavelengths, we predict wavelength-tunable three-photon emission with spatio-angular correlations. These findings establish a novel method for modelling TOSPDC and also highlight the potential of nonlinear resonant metasurfaces as compact free-space photon triplet sources with quantum state control.

    "abstract": "           In this article, we examine different approaches for calculating low frequency opacities in the warm dense matter regime. The relevance of the average-atom approximation and of different models for calculating opacities, such as the Ziman or Ziman-Evans models is discussed and the results compared to \\textit{ab initio} simulations. We begin by recalling the derivation of the Ziman-Evans resistivity from Kubo's linear response theory, using the local approximation to the solutions of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. With the help of this approximation, we explicitly introduce an ionic structure factor into the Ziman formula, without resorting to the Born approximation. Both approaches involve the calculation of scattering phase shifts, which we integrate from Calogero equation with an adaptive step numerical scheme based on a Runge-Kutta-Merson solver. We show that if the atomic number $Z$ is not too large, integrating the phase shifts in this way is more time-efficient than using a classical Numerov-type scheme to solve the radial Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Various approximations are explored for phase shifts to further improve computation time. For the Born approximation, we show that using Born phase shifts directly in the scattering cross-section gives more accurate results than with the integral formula based on the Fourier transform of the electron-ion potential. We also compare an analytical formula based on a Yukawa fit of the electron-ion potential to a numerical integration. The average-atom results are compared with DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations for aluminum in the dilute regime and for copper, aluminum and gold at solid density and different temperatures.

    "abstract": "           We report on experimental investigation of nonperturbative high harmonic generation (HHG) in monolayer MoS2 in the ultraviolet spectral region driven by mid-infrared light. We study how the HHG is influenced by pre-excitation of the monolayer using resonant and near-resonant pulses in a pump-probe-like scheme. The resonant light creates high density exciton population. Due to ultrafast dephasing caused by electron-electron scattering, the HHG is suppressed in the presence of pre-excited carriers. In the case of near-resonant excitation with photon energy below the exciton transition, the dynamics of the observed suppression of the HHG yield contains a fast component which is a consequence of momentum scattering at carriers, which are excited by two-photon transition when the two pulses temporally overlap in the sample. This interpretation is supported by comparison of the experimental data with theoretical calculations of two-photon absorption spectrum of MoS2 monolayer. This work demonstrates a possibility to control HHG in lowdimensional materials on ultrashort timescales by combining the driving strong-field pulse with a weak near-resonant light.         ",

    "abstract": "           We study the stability of a steady Eckart streaming jet that is acoustically forced at one end of a closed cylindrical cavity and impinges the wall at the other end, where a recirculation forms. This configuration generically represents industrial processes where acoustic forcing offers a contactless means of stirring or controlling confined flows. Successfully doing so, however, requires sufficient insight into the topology of the acoustically forced flow. This raises the question of whether the base acoustic streaming jet is stable and, when not, of which alternative states emerge. Using Linear Stability Analysis (LSA) and three-dimensional nonlinear simulations, we identify the instability mechanisms and determine the nature of the bifurcations that ensue. We show that the ratio $C_R$ between the cavity and the maximum beam radii determines the dominant unstable mode. For $4 \\leq C_R \\leq 6$, a non-oscillatory perturbation rooted in the jet impingement triggers a supercritical bifurcation. For $C_R = 3$, the flow destabilises through a subcritical non-oscillatory bifurcation. Further reducing $C_R$ increases the shear within the flow, and gradually relocates the instability in the shear layer between impingement-induced vortices: for $C_R = 2$, an unstable travelling wave grows out of a subcritical bifurcation, which becomes supercritical for $C_R=1$. For each geometry, the nonlinear 3D simulations validate the LSA, identify the saturated nonlinear state and its stability. This study offers fundamental insight into the stability of acoustically-driven flows in general, but also opens possible pathways to either induce turbulence acoustically, or to avoid it in realistic configurations.

Integrating QDs into low-loss photonic circuits can facilitate complex quantum networks by enabling entanglement transfer via two-photon interference.

To understand the overall QKD network performance, it is required to transition from the analysis of individual links, as done so far, to the characterization of the network as a whole. In this work, we undertake this study by embedding QKD protocols on complex networks, which correctly model the existing fiber networks. We focus on networks with trusted nodes and on continuous-variable (CV) schemes, which have much higher key rates than their discrete-variable (DV) counterparts. In the effective CV network, however, many of the unique properties of complex networks, such as small-worldness and the presence of hubs, are lost due to the fast decay of the key rate with physical distance for CV systems. These properties can be restored when considering a hybrid network consisting of both CV and DV protocols, achieving at the same time high average rate and inter-connectivity. Our work opens the path to the study of QKD complex networks in existing infrastructures.         ",
