    "abstract": "           We explore a robust fabrication process for periodically-poled thin-film lithium tantalate (PP-TFLT) by systematically varying fabrication parameters and confirming the quality of inverted domains with second-harmonic microscopy (SHM). We find a periodic poling recipe that can be applied to both acoustic-grade and optical-grade film, electrode material, and presence of an oxide interlayer. By using a single high-voltage electrical pulse with peak voltage time of 10 ms or less and a ramp-down time of 90 s, rectangular poling domains are established and stabilized in the PP-TFLT. We employ our robust periodic poling process in a controllable pole-after-etch approach to produce PP-TFLT ridge waveguides with normalized second harmonic generation (SHG) conversion efficiencies of 208 %W-1cm-2 from 1550 nm to 775 nm in line with the theoretical value of 244 %W-1cm-2. This work establishes a high-performance poling process and demonstrates telecommunications band SHG for thin-film lithium tantalate, expanding the capabilities of the platform for frequency mixing applications in quantum photonics, sensing, and spectroscopy.

    "abstract": "           The problem of calculating the electron-positively charged particle correlation energy poses a challenge in the field of quantum chemistry beyond the adiabatic approximation. In this study, a toy model called Exotic Harmonium is developed to enhance our understanding of this type of correlation. Since the analytical methods to solve the eigenvalue equation for Exotic Harmonium lead to the excited rather than the ground state of the system, we employ the variation method in this study to obtain an approximate ground state wave function. By considering the asymptotic behavior of the wave function, we derive a compact but highly accurate variational wave function. Using this wave function, we are able to determine various properties of the system, including energy and its components, as well as single-particle densities. Additionally, we extend key concepts and quantities specifically tailored to study electron correlation in the Harmonium model to the Exotic Harmonium model. For instance, the \"correlation hill\" concept effectively highlights the distinct nature of electron-positively charged particle correlation compared to electron-electron correlation. Furthermore, we utilize Exotic Harmonium to assess the accuracy of five electron-positively charged particle correlation functionals developed within the context of the two-component density functional theory. Through a regression process, we obtained a compact yet precise analytical form for wave function which explicitly depends on the two crucial variables: oscillator field frequency and positively charged particle mass. This analytical form provides valuable insights into the behavior of the system. Also, the Exotic Harmonium model enables the investigation of electron-positively charged particle correlation in a vast range of particle masses.         ",

We propose replacing the HF wave function with a spin- and spatial-symmetry broken wave function, enhancing convergence by adding a spin operator, $S^2$ as a penalty term to the original molecular Hamiltonian. We verify that this approach provides good convergence behavior towards the lowest energy eigenstate using direct matrix exponentiation for Imaginary Time Evolution (ITE). Numerical simulations were performed on the hydrogen molecule and a square tetrahydrogen cluster using measurement-assisted unitary approximation in QITE. QITE demonstrates faster convergence to the ground state with broken symmetry (BS) compared to HF, particularly after the molecule exhibits a diradical character of 0.56 for hydrogen. Prior to this point, HF remains more effective, suggesting a transition threshold of diradical character for wave function selection. Additionally, the overlap analysis with Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CAS-CI) wave function shows that BS has a larger initial overlap than HF in higher-spin, multi-configurational systems like triple bond dissociation in nitrogen molecule. This method provides a pathway for improved energy simulations in open shell systems, where wave function accuracy significantly impacts downstream quantum algorithms and practical applications in quantum chemistry.

    "abstract": "           This paper presents a brief review on theoretical and numerical works on three-dimensional acoustic turbulence both in a weakly nonlinear regime, when the amplitudes of sound waves are small, and in the case of strong nonlinearity. This review is based on the classical studies on weak acoustic turbulence by V.E. Zakharov (1965) and V.E. Zakharov and R.Z. Sagdeev (1970), on the one hand, and on the other hand, by B.B. Kadomtsev and V.I. Petviashvili (1972). Until recently, there were no convincing numerical experiments confirming one or the other point of view. In the works of the authors of this review in 2022 and 2024, strong arguments were found based on direct numerical modeling in favor of both theories. It is shown that the Zakharov-Sagdeev spectrum of weak turbulence $\\propto k^{-3/2}$ is realized not only for small positive dispersion of sound waves, but also in the case of complete absence of dispersion. The calculated turbulence spectra in the weakly nonlinear regime have anisotropic distribution: for small $k$, narrow cones (jets) are formed, broadening in the Fourier space. For weak dispersion, the jets are smoothed out, and the turbulence spectrum tends to be isotropic in the region of short wavelengths. In the absence of dispersion, the turbulence spectrum is a discrete set of jets subjected to diffraction divergence. For each individual jet, nonlinear effects are much weaker than diffraction ones, which prevents the formation of shock waves. Thus, the Zakharov-Sagdeev spectrum is realized due to the smallness of nonlinear effects compared to dispersion or diffraction. As the pumping level increases in the non-dispersive regime, when nonlinear effects begin to dominate, shock waves are formed. As a result, acoustic turbulence passes into a strongly nonlinear state in the form of an ensemble of random shocks described by the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili spectrum $\\propto k^{-2}$.         ",

    "abstract": "           Chip-scale optical frequency combs based on microresonators (microcombs) enable GHz-THz repetition rates, broad bandwidth, compactness, and compatibility with wafer-scale manufacturing. Silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits have become a leading platform due to their low loss, broad transparency, lithographic dispersion control, and commercial 200-mm-wafer foundry access. They have enabled system-level applications in optical communications, LiDAR, frequency synthesis, low-noise microwave generation, and convolutional processing. However, real-world deployment is hindered by the challenge of deterministic soliton microcomb generation, primarily due to thermal instabilities. Although techniques like pulsed pumping, fast scanning, and auxiliary lasers help mitigate these effects, they often add complexity or reduce soliton stability. In this work, we overcome thermal limitations and demonstrate deterministic soliton generation in silicon nitride photonic circuits. We trace the thermal effects to copper impurities within waveguides, originating from residual contaminants in CMOS-grade silicon wafers that are gettered into silicon nitride during fabrication. By developing effective copper removal techniques, we significantly reduce thermal instabilities. This enables soliton generation with arbitrary or slow laser scanning, removing a key barrier to microcomb deployment. Our approach is compatible with front-end-of-line foundry processing, paving the way for broader adoption of soliton microcomb technologies.         ",

Specifically, we present deterministic control over the sign of optical forces exerted on a metasurface integrated on a suspended silicon nanomembrane. By tailoring the geometry of the constituent meta-atoms, we engineer the coherent superposition of their multipolar modes, and consequently, the net optical force experienced by the metasurface within a phase-controlled optical standing wave. In excellent agreement with 3D numerical simulations, we experimentally realize both attractive and repulsive forces on distinct metasurface designs, directly mirroring the behavior of two-level systems interacting with optical fields.

    "abstract": "           Quantum reservoir computing offers a promising approach to the utilization of complex quantum dynamics in machine learning. Statistical noise inevitably arises in real settings of quantum reservoir computing (QRC) due to the practical necessity of taking a small to moderate number of measurements. We investigate the effect of statistical noise in spin-network QRC on the possible performance benefits conferred by quantumness. As our measures of quantumness, we employ both quantum entanglement, which we quantify by the partial transpose of the density matrix, and coherence, which we quantify as the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix. We find that reservoirs which enjoy a finite degree of quantum entanglement and coherence are more stable against the adverse effects of statistical noise on performance compared to their unentangled, incoherent counterparts. Our results indicate that the potential benefit reservoir computers may derive from quantumness depends on the number of measurements used for training and testing, and may indeed be enhanced by statistical noise. These findings not only emphasize the importance of incorporating realistic noise models, but also suggest that the search for quantum advantage may be aided rather than impeded by the practical constraints of implementation within existing machines.

Two complementary coherent multidimensional spectroscopic techniques are presented, which reveal the dynamical nature of the mode correlations in the presence relaxation.

The chosen cavity-vibron mode coupling strengths fall within the range of inter-vibrational mode coupling, hinting at a parameter regime where vibrational energy dispersal can be controlled.

Their development is crucial for both energy-efficient optical interconnects and photonic quantum technologies, but neither rigorous theoretical frameworks nor systematic experimental methods governing deterministic emitters and their identification were so far available. A central -- and seemingly obvious -- assumption underpinning previous works is that the radiative emission probability is proportional to the internal quantum efficiency. Here, we introduce a stochastic model of the decay dynamics in quantum emitters that disproves this assumption and provides a systematic framework for the development of deterministic quantum light sources. Our model agrees with a wide range of experimental findings, including time-resolved spectroscopy, autocorrelation measurements, and saturation spectroscopy, and it also explains a number of hitherto unexplained experiments. For example, our model shows that above-band continuous-wave excitation selects the exciton transitions with the lowest quantum efficiency, which is of direct importance for photonic quantum technologies relying on aligning nanostructures to emitters. We show that the underlying physics is governed by incoherent trapping of the population in metastable states, which has profound consequences for the physics of quantum emitters.

We further extend our analysis to assess the ability of a trained model to generalize beyond its training distribution, both to the same system under different physical parameters and to fundamentally different quantum sources.

In particular, we consider formulations with standard upwind and general symmetric fluxes. The CHDG hybridized system can be written as a fixed-point problem, which can be solved with stationary iterative schemes for a class of symmetric fluxes. The standard HDG and CHDG methods are systematically studied with the different numerical fluxes by considering a series of 2D numerical benchmarks.

Our results show that the standing-wave trapping field is necessary for backaction suppression in three dimensions, and they satisfy the Heisenberg limit of detection.         ",

    "abstract": "           This study explores the mixed convection of carbon nanotube (CNT)-water nanofluid within a square cavity containing heated cylinders under the influence of a magnetic field, focusing on three geometric configurations: a single heated cylinder, two heated cylinders, and two heated cylinders with a flow deflector. The impact of various parameters, including Reynolds number ($Re$), Richardson number ($Ri$), Hartmann number ($Ha$), wavy wall peaks ($n$), nanoparticle volume fraction ($\\phi$), Hartmann angle ($\\gamma$), rotational speed ($\\omega$), and inclination angle ($\\alpha$), on thermal and fluid dynamic behaviors is analyzed. MWCNT nanofluids exhibit up to a 19.1% increase in $Nu_{\\text{ave}}$ compared to SWCNT nanofluids, confirming their superior heat transfer performance. Adding a second heated cylinder increases $Nu_{\\text{ave}}$ by approximately 71.7% compared to a single-cylinder configuration, while the inclusion of a flow deflector modifies vortex structures, further enhancing convective transport. Increasing wavy wall peaks ($n$) enhances heat transfer by intensifying vortex formation and disrupting thermal boundary layers, leading to a more uniform temperature distribution. SWCNT nanofluids exhibit Bejan numbers up to 58.7% higher than MWCNT nanofluids, indicating greater thermal irreversibility. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing thermal management systems in engineering applications, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate nanofluids, geometric configurations, and magnetic field parameters to achieve optimal thermal performance and fluid stability.

We also show that adding a second feedback cavity of the appropriate length can significantly suppress noise-induced modulations that are present in the single feedback system. This reduces the short time scale fluctuations of the interspike interval time and at the same time improves the variance of the fluctuation of the pulse arrival times on long time scales.         ",

    "abstract": "           Semiconductor nano-crystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have attracted significant attention for their unique fluorescence properties. Under continuous excitation, QDs emit photons with intricate intensity fluctuation: the intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a fluctuation pattern can vary across different QDs even under the same experimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed intensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding and normalization. Conventional normality-based single-dot analysis fall short of addressing these complexities. In collaboration with chemists, we develop an integrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series from multiple QDs. Motivated by the unique data structure and the hypothesized behaviors of the QDs, our approach leverages the celebrated hidden Markov model as its structural backbone to characterize individual dot intensity fluctuations, while assuming that, in each state the normalized intensity follows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, the state/emission distributions are shared across the QDs, and the state transition dynamics can vary among a few QD clusters. This framework allows for a precise, collective characterization of intensity fluctuation patterns and have the potential to transform current practice in chemistry. Applying our method to experimental data from 128 QDs, we reveal three shared intensity states and capture several distinct intensity transition patterns, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach in providing deeper insights into QD behaviors and their design and application potential.

    "abstract": "           Wavefront shaping systems aim to image deep into scattering tissue by reshaping incoming and outgoing light to correct aberrations caused by tissue inhomogeneity However, the desired modulation depends on the unknown tissue structure and therefore its estimation is a challenging time-consuming task. Most strategies rely on coordinate descent optimization, which sequentially varies each modulation parameter and assesses its impact on the resulting image. We propose a rapid wavefront shaping scheme that transitions from coordinate descent to gradient descent optimization, using the same measurement to update all modulation parameters simultaneously. To achieve this, we have developed an analytical framework that expresses the gradient of the wavefront shaping score with respect to all modulation parameters. Although this gradient depends on the unknown tissue structure, we demonstrate how it can be inferred from the optical system's measurements. Our new framework enables rapid inference of wavefront shaping modulations. Additionally, since the complexity of our algorithm does not scale with the number of modulation parameters, we can achieve very high-resolution modulations, leading to better corrections in thicker tissue layers. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework in correcting aberrations in a coherent confocal microscope.         ",

    "abstract": "           Lithium niobate (LN) metasurfaces exhibit remarkable Pockels effect-driven electro-optic tunability, enabling dynamic control of optical responses through external electric fields. When combined with their high second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\\chi^{2}$), this tunability is projected into the nonlinear landscape, realizing second-harmonic generation (SHG)-dominated functionalities in integrated photonics. However, achieving deep SHG modulation in LN metasurfaces remains challenging due to LN's limited refractive index tunability under practical driving voltage. To address this, we design an air-hole-structured LN metasurface by strategically adjusting air hole positions to induce Brillouin zone folding-enabled bound states in the continuum with ultrahigh quality factors ($Q>10^{4}$). Numerical simulations demonstrate a $2.59\\%$ SHG conversion efficiency at 0.1 MW/cm$^{2}$ excitation and a modulation depth exceeding 0.99 under 15 V peak-to-peak voltage ($\\Delta V_{\\text{pp}}$). This work establishes a compact framework for electrically tunable nonlinear optics, advancing applications in integrated quantum light sources and programmable photonic chips.         ",

    "abstract": "           Periodically poled lithium niobate on insulator (PPLNOI) ridge waveguides are critical photonic components for both classical and quantum information processing. However, dry etching of PPLNOI waveguides often generates rough sidewalls and variations in the etching rates of oppositely poled lithium niobate ferroelectric domains, leading a relatively high propagation losses (0.25 - 1 dB/cm), which significantly limits net conversion efficiency and hinders scalable photonic integration. In this work, a low-loss PPLNOI ridge waveguide with a length of 7 mm was fabricated using ultra-smooth sidewalls through photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching followed by high-voltage pulse poling. The average surface roughness was measured at just 0.27 nm, resulting in significantly lower propagation loss compared to dry-etched counterparts. Highly efficient second-harmonic generation was demonstrated with a normalized efficiency of 1742%/(W*cm^2) and an overall efficiency of 750.1%/W (without accounting for propagation loss). The absolute conversion efficiency reached 15.8%, representing a six-fold improvement over the best previously reported values in single-period PPLNOI waveguides without magnesium oxide doping.

In the two-mode case, which models devices such as interferometers, we find that entanglement strongly degrades differential phase sensitivity. Finally, we show that minimizing entanglement between paths maximizes the phase sensitivity of $N$-mode systems with zero-mean Gaussian state inputs.         ",

    "abstract": "           The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.         ",
