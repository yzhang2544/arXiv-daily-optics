    "title": "Equivalent Circuit Modeling of a Lumped-element Loaded Metasurface under Arbitrary Incidence and Polarization",
    "abstract": "           In recent years, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a key technology for next-generation communication, offering real-time and dynamic control over electromagnetic wave characteristics. The scattering of an RIS unit cell can be effectively modeled using an equivalent circuit model (ECM) of a lumped RLC-loaded metasurface. However, existing ECMs, particularly those with square patches, often fail to generalize beyond specific configurations or integrate lumped elements, limiting their practical applicability to single polarization or normal incidence. In this work, we propose a simple yet robust ECM that accurately predicts the spectral response while maintaining adaptability across varying design parameters, including polarization, arbitrary angles of incidence, and physical dimensions of lumped elements. Our approach is built incrementally, starting from a 1x1 unit cell as the fundamental structure and extending to 2x1 and 2x2 cell configurations. The 2x2 cell structure allows for multifunctionality and reconfigurability in dual independent polarizations. These capabilities facilitate the realization of vector holographic metasurfaces. Validation with full-wave simulations demonstrates strong agreement, highlighting the efficiency and robustness of our model. This work lays the foundation for simplified and effective RIS modeling and optimization in advanced communication systems.         ",

    "title": "Multi-Frequency Reverberant Shear Waves for Assessing Tissue Dispersion in Optical Coherence Elastography",
    "abstract": "           Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is a powerful non-invasive imaging technique for high-resolution assessment of tissue elasticity and viscoelasticity. Accurate characterization of viscoelastic properties requires estimating shear wave speed (SWS) across multiple frequencies, as dispersion induces frequency-dependent variations in wave speed. This study introduces a novel multi-frequency reverberant OCE (MFR-OCE) approach to enhance viscoelastic tissue characterization by simultaneously capturing shear wave dynamics over multiple frequencies. We present the theoretical framework, experimental setup, and validation of MFR-OCE through simulations and experiments on gelatin phantoms, ex vivo porcine cornea, and ex vivo bovine liver. Simulation results demonstrate that MFR-OCE estimates SWS with errors below 4% relative to ground truth, and phantom experimental results show that MFR-OCE and single-frequency OCE also yield closely matching SWS estimates, with differences below 3%. Furthermore, the frequency-dependent dispersion coefficients extracted from biological tissues and phantoms align with the theoretical viscoelastic power law model. The gelatin phantoms exhibit a low viscoelastic behavior with an exponent of 0.13 for the power law fit of SWS, while the ex vivo porcine cornea demonstrates intermediate viscoelastic behavior, with a power law exponent of 0.33. The liver tissue shows significant frequency dependence, with a power law exponent of 0.51. These findings demonstrate that MFR-OCE enables a more comprehensive understanding of tissue mechanics and holds the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy in clinical applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           The isolation-free operation of photonic integrated circuits enables dense integration, reducing packaging costs and complexity. Most isolator replacements require a change in the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) foundry process and suffer from large insertion loss. Most solutions did not integrate the laser, leaving the verification incomplete, and measurements with modulated reflections have also been missing. In this work, we present, for the first time, a zero-process-change silicon photonic (SiP) circuit that, when paired with an integrated distributed-feedback laser (DFB), enhances the DFB's immunity to continuous-wave and modulated parasitic reflections from multiple reflectors. The circuit generates intentional, controlled self-injection to stabilize laser dynamics and maintain operation. The SiP circuit is complemented by an electro-optic feedback loop that dynamically adjusts the self-injection to preserve laser stability. The proposed circuit introduces an insertion loss of 1.5 dB and enables the DFB laser to tolerate back reflections as large as -7 dB and -12 dB from on-chip and off-chip reflectors, respectively. The DFB is hybrid integrated with the SiP chip using a photonic wire bond (PWB). The isolator-free operation of the integrated laser in a high-speed optical link has been demonstrated, highlighting its potential for data communication applications.         ",

Using template image matching with differential evolution optimization, we identify the most similar 2D plane in 3D. The method is validated on a synthetic porous medium, achieving exact registration, and applied to Berea sandstone, where it achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.990. With the registered images, we explore upscaling properties based on paired multimodal images, focusing on pore characteristics and effective elastic moduli. The thin-section image reveals 50 % more porosity and submicron pores than the registered CT plane. In addition, bulk and shear moduli from thin sections are 25 % and 30 % lower, respectively, than those derived from CT images. Beyond numerical comparisons, thin sections provide additional geological insights, including cementation, mineral phases, and weathering effects, which are not clear in CT images. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal image registration to improve computed rock properties in digital rock physics by integrating complementary imaging modalities.         ",

Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) and their variants have been introduced and evaluated to solve inverse problems. However, similar to PINNs, current versions of PIKANs are limited to obtaining solutions for a single computational domain per training run; consequently, a new geometry requires retraining the model from scratch. Physics-informed PointNet (PIPN) was introduced to address this limitation for PINNs. In this work, we introduce physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold PointNet (PI-KAN-PointNet) to extend this capability to PIKANs. PI-KAN-PointNet enables the simultaneous solution of an inverse problem over multiple irregular geometries within a single training run, reducing computational costs. We construct KANs using Jacobi polynomials and investigate their performance by considering Jacobi polynomials of different degrees and types in terms of both computational cost and prediction accuracy. As a benchmark test case, we consider natural convection in a square enclosure with a cylinder, where the cylinder's shape varies across a dataset of 135 geometries. We compare the performance of PI-KAN-PointNet with that of PIPN (i.e., physics-informed PointNet with MLPs) and observe that, with approximately an equal number of trainable parameters and similar computational cost, PI-KAN-PointNet provides more accurate predictions. Finally, we explore the combination of KAN and MLP in constructing a physics-informed PointNet. Our findings indicate that a physics-informed PointNet model employing MLP layers as the encoder and KAN layers as the decoder represents the optimal configuration among all models investigated.

Due to the fundamental insensitivity of J-couplings to magnetic field fluctuations, we achieve extremely stable coherent oscillations for longer than 3000 s, with a 337 uHz linewidth limited primarily by the measurement time.

Higher-order resonance modes of the cantilever oscillation leads to higher frequency. To discuss such high-order-mode oscillation, a differential equation governing MFM cantilever oscillation in the high-order resonance mode is formulated, and an analytical solution of the phase difference is obtained.

The determination of the refractive indices in the wavelength range of 435-1083 nm showed anomalous dispersion of the refractive indices, resulting in a point of uniaxiality. The crystal allows phase matching for collinear second harmonic generation (SHG) processes of both type I and type II in a broad wavelength range. SHG properties were studied for powdered size-fractioned samples and oriented single-crystal cuts. The optical damage threshold experiments confirmed excellent optical resistance - at least 220 TWm-2 and 70 TWm-2 for 800 and 1000 nm irradiation, respectively.

    "abstract": "           The inverse design of metamaterial architectures presents a significant challenge, particularly for nonlinear mechanical properties involving large deformations, buckling, contact, and plasticity. Traditional methods, such as gradient-based optimization, and recent generative deep-learning approaches often rely on binary pixel-based representations, which introduce jagged edges that hinder finite element (FE) simulations and 3D printing. To overcome these challenges, we propose an inverse design framework that utilizes a signed distance function (SDF) representation combined with a conditional diffusion model. The SDF provides a smooth boundary representation, eliminating the need for post-processing and ensuring compatibility with FE simulations and manufacturing methods. A classifier-free guided diffusion model is trained to generate SDFs conditioned on target macroscopic stress-strain curves, enabling efficient one-shot design synthesis. To assess the mechanical response of the generated designs, we introduce a forward prediction model based on Neural Operator Transformers (NOT), which accurately predicts homogenized stress-strain curves and local solution fields for arbitrary geometries with irregular query meshes. This approach enables a closed-loop process for general metamaterial design, offering a pathway for the development of advanced functional materials.         ",

In photonic crystal slabs, far-field emission from guided resonances naturally provides a non-invasive way to probe the embedded wavefunctions, raising the question of how the information carried by escaping photons relates to the band topology. We develop a non-Hermitian model to describe the guided and leaky modes of photonic crystal slabs with long-range couplings and non-local responses. Within this framework, radiation Berry curvature is defined from the far-field polarization and compared to the conventional bulk Berry curvature of the crystal Bloch modes. We investigate this bulk-radiation correspondence in the vicinity of the $\\Gamma$-point of the square lattice and the $K$-point of the honeycomb lattice. The results show that the comparability between the bulk topology and the radiation topology is not universal; the validity is contingent upon the specific bulk Bloch states. Notably, the correspondence completely breaks down surrounding the far-field singularities, while it can hold in smooth regions under special symmetry conditions, e.g., rotational symmetry. Besides, net Berry curvature concentration is captured at the valleys of the non-local honeycomb lattice, facilitating further exploration on generalized topological phases in photonic lattices beyond the regimes with localized couplings and Hermiticity.

    "abstract": "           Experimental tests of gravity's fundamental nature call for mechanical systems in the quantum regime while being sensitive to gravity. Torsion pendula, historically vital in studies of classical gravity, are ideal for extending gravitational tests into the quantum realm due to their inherently high mechanical quality factor, even when mass-loaded. Here, we demonstrate laser cooling of a centimeter-scale torsional oscillator to a temperature of 10 mK (average occupancy of 6000 phonons) starting from room temperature. This is achieved by optical radiation pressure forces conditioned on a quantum-noise-limited optical measurement of the torsional mode with an imprecision 9.8 dB below its peak zero-point motion. The measurement sensitivity is the result of a novel `mirrored' optical lever that passively rejects extraneous spatial-mode noise by 60 dB. The high mechanical quality ($1.4\\times 10^7$) and quantum-noise-limited measurement imprecision demonstrate the necessary ingredients for realizing the quantum ground state of torsional motion -- a pre-requisite for mechanical tests of gravity's alleged quantum nature.

    "title": "Behavior of water and aqueous LiCl solutions confined in cylindrical silica pores: A wide temperature range molecular dynamics simulation study",
    "abstract": "           We report here a molecular dynamics simulation study on water and aqueous LiCl solutions confined in 1.6 nm cylindrical pores of silica to investigate a dynamical cross-over, observed earlier experimentally, wherein LiCl slows down confined water at high temperatures but makes it faster at lower temperatures. The cross-over observed in the experiments is reproduced in the simulations, albeit at lower temperature. Moreover, the cross-over encompasses all aspects of dynamics including translation as well as rotation. Both addition of LiCl and confinement result in a breaking of hydrogen bond network in confined water, eliminating the need for long jumps via exchange of hydrogen bonded partner molecules. This lowers the activation energy for diffusion in the electrolyte solution compared to pure confined water and leads to the dynamical cross-over seen at lower temperatures. Our results thus provide an explanation to the experimentally observed phenomena and provide important insights on the interplay of confinement, temperature and presence of electrolytes on the dynamical behavior of nano-confined water.

    "abstract": "           In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.         ",

    "title": "Effective Method for Inverse Ising Problem under Missing Observations in Restricted Boltzmann Machines",
    "abstract": "           Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are energy-based models analogous to the Ising model and are widely applied in statistical machine learning. The standard inverse Ising problem with a complete dataset requires computing both data and model expectations and is computationally challenging because model expectations have a combinatorial explosion. Furthermore, in many applications, the available datasets are partially incomplete, making it difficult to compute even data expectations. In this study, we propose a approximation framework for these expectations in the practical inverse Ising problems that integrates mean-field approximation or persistent contrastive divergence to generate refined initial points and spatial Monte Carlo integration to enhance estimator accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed method effectively and accurately tunes the model parameters in comparison to the conventional method.         ",
