    "abstract": "           Optical and acoustic metasurfaces are two-dimensional arrays of subwavelength elements that locally modulate or phase shift incident waves. Acoustoplasmonic metasurfaces combine the physics of light and sound, producing acoustic wavefronts in response to optical stimuli. Herein, we present a computational inverse acoustoplasmonic metasurface design algorithm for desired optically-generated acoustic wave fields. We consider gold nanoparticles producing spherical acoustic waves in water, and the resulting acoustic wave propagation along the plane containing the nanoparticle array. We demonstrate how our algorithm can be used to design metasurfaces that can be used to achieve complex acoustic wave fields. This includes the design of a single metasurface that produces acoustic wave fields mimicking two different Morse code patterns upon stimulation with two orthogonal polarization states of light. This work provides a new tool for the design of complex optically generated acoustic wavefronts, enabling functionality beyond what would be achievable with off-optical-resonance optoacoustic excitation.

Our results show trapping of multiple acoustic modes in this structure, featuring a multi-peak Brillouin gain spectrum due to the excitation of higher-order acoustic modes.

    "abstract": "           As the innovative potential of quantum technologies comes into focus, so too does the urgent need to address their ethical implications. While many voices highlight the importance of ethical engagement, less attention has been paid to the conditions that make such engagement possible. In this article, I argue that technological understanding is a foundational capacity for meaningful ethical reflection on emerging technology like quantum technologies. Drawing on De Jong & De Haro's account of technological understanding (2025a; 2025b), I clarify what such understanding entails and how it enables ethical enquiry. I contend that ethical assessment, first and foremost, requires an understanding of what quantum technologies can do - their functional capacities and, by extension, their potential applications. Current efforts to build engagement capacities among broader audiences - within and beyond academic contexts - tend, however, to focus on explaining the underlying quantum mechanics. Instead, I advocate a shift from a physics-first to a functions-first approach: fostering an understanding of quantum technologies' capabilities as the basis for ethical reflection. Presenting technological understanding as an epistemic requirement for meaningful ethical engagement may appear to raise the bar for participation. However, by decoupling functional understanding from technical expertise, this condition becomes attainable for a broader group, contributing not only to a well-informed but also to a more inclusive ethical debate.

    "abstract": "           Topological lasers, known for their robustness and unique features originating from nontrivial topology, have recently become a focal point of research in photonics. In this work, we propose a topological laser based on two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic lattices as induced by artificial gauge flux insertion. The underlying effect, called the topological Wannier cycles, is characterized by topological local modes with continuously tunable frequency and orbital angular momentum emerging in two photonic band gaps. These topological local modes enable single-mode large-area lasing in each photonic band gap with both topological robustness and exceptional tunability in frequency and OAM properties, setting a notable contrast with previous topological lasers. We further discuss both localized and extended artificial gauge flux insertion and compare their properties. We find that extended gauge flux achieves significantly higher laser output intensity and larger single-mode area under laser-gain conditions, outperforming the local gauge flux configuration in both output intensity and resilience against disorders. We also elucidate the precise mechanisms by which nonlinear gain and gauge flux govern the photon dynamics in various regimes. These results provide crucial theoretical insights for OAM control in topological lasers and pave the way for advancements in high precision engineering of lasers and optical systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Background: Beam angle optimization (BAO) is a critical component of radiation therapy (RT) treatment planning, where small changes in beam configuration can significantly impact treatment quality, especially for proton RT. Mathematically, BAO is a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem, which is NP-hard due to its exponential growing search space. Traditional optimization techniques often struggle with computational efficiency, necessitating the development of novel approaches. Purpose: This study introduces QC-BAO, a hybrid quantum-classical approach that leverages quantum computing to solve the MIP formulation of BAO. Methods: The proposed approach, QC-BAO, models BAO as an MIP problem, incorporating binary variables for beam angle selection and continuous variables for optimizing spot intensities for proton therapy. The proposed approach employs a hybrid quantum-classical framework, utilizing quantum computing to solve the binary decision component while integrating classical optimization techniques, including iterative convex relaxation and alternating direction method of multipliers. Results: Computational experiments were conducted on clinical test cases to evaluate QC-BAO's performance against clinically verified angles and a heuristic approach, GS-BAO. QC-BAO demonstrated improved treatment plan quality over both clinical and GS-BAO. The method consistently increased the conformity index (CI) for target coverage while reducing mean and maximum doses to organs-at-risk (OAR). Additionally, QC-BAO produced the lowest objective function value, confirming its superior optimization capability. Conclusions: The findings highlight the potential of quantum computing to enhance the solution to BAO problem by demonstrated improvement in plan quality using the proposed method, QC-BAO. This study paves the way for future clinical implementation of quantum-accelerated optimization in RT.         ",

A \"Jacob's Ladder\" approach leverages computationally-optimized layers of massively parallel high performance software with increasing accuracy to compute: i) Density Functional Theory (DFT); ii) Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC); iii) Selected Configuration Interaction (s-CI), within large volumes and optimized time-to-solution performances.

Among these defects, PL5 and PL6 stand out due to their superior charge stability and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties at room temperature. However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing controversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults. Previous measurements relying on spin ensemble detection are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In this study, we conduct correlative imaging of stacking faults and PL5-6 at single-defect level, conclusively demonstrating that PL5-6 are not associated with stacking faults. Further investigation of PL5 through single-spin ODMR spectroscopy allows us to determine its six spatial orientations, as well as to measure the orientation of its transverse anisotropy spin splitting (E) and the statistical distribution of hyperfine splitting. These results and ab initio calculations suggest that PL5 should be VsiVc(hk) divacancy coupled with a nearby antisite atom (VVA). The structure resolution of PL5 starts the first step toward its controllable fabrication, paving the way for various applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           The problem of locating an odor source in turbulent flows is central to key applications such as environmental monitoring and disaster response. We address this challenge by designing an algorithm based on Bayesian inference, which uses odor measurements from an ensemble of static sensors to estimate the source position through a stochastic model of the environment. The problem is difficult because of the multiscale and out-of-equilibrium properties of turbulent transport, which lack accurate analytical and phenomenological modeling, thus preventing a guaranteed convergence for Bayesian approaches. To overcome the risk of relying on a single unavoidably wrong model approximation, we propose a method to rank ``many wrong models'' and to blend their predictions. We evaluated our \\emph{weighted Bayesian update} algorithm by its ability to estimate the source location with predefined accuracy and/or within a specified time frame and compare it to standard Monte Carlo sampling methods. To demonstrate the robustness and potential applications of both approaches under realistic environmental conditions, we use high-quality direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations to mimic the turbulent transport of odors in presence of a strong mean wind. Despite minimal prior information on the source and environmental conditions, our proposed approach consistently proves to be more accurate, reliable, and robust than Monte Carlo methods, thus showing promise as a new tool for addressing the odor source localization problem in real-world scenarios.

By revealing influences of the liquid-layer loading on wave velocity of SAW and topological indices (Berry curvature and Chern number) of topological interface-modes, a topological resonance peak with a high Q-factor is obtained based on couplings of a topological interface-mode waveguide and a resonant cavity under a surface liquid-layer loading. The results show that the degree of spatial-inversion-symmetry breaking resulting from structure parameters has an obvious influences on the topological resonance Q-factor, while the influences of the thickness of the liquid-layer loading on that is weak. It is worth noting that the topological resonance frequency is significantly sensitive to the liquid parameters. Based on that, a novel topological-resonance SAW liquid-phase sensor is proposed. Furthermore, sensing performances of this kind of sensor are simulated, which are used to sensing the concentration of hemoglobin, albumin, NaCl and NaI in aqueous solutions, and high sensitivities and Q-factors are obtained.

Our approach defines optical AM using time derivatives of the electric and magnetic fields, yielding a gauge-invariant formulation that includes both transverse and longitudinal components and explicitly incorporates charge and current densities.

We apply this framework to analyze spin-orbit conversion (SOC) in two scenarios: scattering of circularly polarized (CP) beams by a gold nanoparticle and focusing of CP and linearly polarized optical vortex beams by a lens. The results show that SOC depends on particle size and polarization, with notable OAM loss in larger particles and CP beam focusing. This framework enables the evaluation of previously overlooked SAM and OAM losses, providing a powerful tool for studying systems in which the analysis of AM losses is intrinsically important, such as chiral materials, as well as for designing photonic devices and exploring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.

In addition to the primary comb that propagates along with the pump, Rayleigh scattering creates a comb that travels in the opposite direction. Normally, the scattering is a very weak, however, in the high-quality-factor MRR the power transferred to the backward-propagating comb can be quite significant. We demonstrate that the backward-propagating comb can be used as a feedback source for a fiber laser, effectively creating a nonlinear mirror for the laser cavity. By assembling a simple laser cavity comprising only active fiber and two mirrors, one of which is an integrated MRR, we show a robust self-starting comb generation with width exceeding 500 nm. We confirm the universal character of this approach for other types of microresonators, including whispering gallery mode resonators, by launching self-starting laser cavity combs with the crystalline toroidal cavity, coupled with a tapered fiber.

    "title": "Entanglement transfer during quantum frequency conversion in gas-filled hollow-core fibers",
    "abstract": "           Quantum transduction is essential for the future hybrid quantum networks, connecting devices across different spectral ranges. In this regard, molecular modulation in hollow-core fibers has proven to be exceptional for efficient and tunable frequency conversion of arbitrary light fields down to the single-photon limit. However, insights on this conversion method for quantum light have remained elusive beyond standard semiclassical models. In this Letter, we employ a quantum Hamiltonian framework to characterize the behavior of entanglement during molecular modulation, while describing the quantum dynamics of both molecules and photons in agreement with recent experiments. In particular, apart from obtaining analytical expressions for the final opto-molecular states, our model predicts a close correlation between the evolution of the average photon numbers and the transfer of entanglement between the interacting parties. These results will contribute to the development of new fiber-based strategies to tackle the challenges associated with the upcoming generation of lightwave quantum technologies.         ",
