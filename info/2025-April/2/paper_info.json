    "title": "The Quantum Memory Matrix: A Unified Framework for the Black Hole Information Paradox",
    "abstract": "           We present the Quantum Memory Matrix (QMM) hypothesis, which addresses the longstanding Black Hole Information Paradox rooted in the apparent conflict between Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity (GR). This paradox raises the question of how information is preserved during black hole formation and evaporation, given that Hawking radiation appears to result in information loss, challenging unitarity in quantum mechanics. The QMM hypothesis proposes that space-time itself acts as a dynamic quantum information reservoir, with quantum imprints encoding information about quantum states and interactions directly into the fabric of space-time at the Planck scale. By defining a quantized model of space-time and mechanisms for information encoding and retrieval, QMM aims to conserve information in a manner consistent with unitarity during black hole processes. We develop a mathematical framework that includes space-time quantization, definitions of quantum imprints, and interactions that modify quantum state evolution within this structure. Explicit expressions for the interaction Hamiltonians are provided, demonstrating unitarity preservation in the combined system of quantum fields and the QMM. This hypothesis is compared with existing theories, including the holographic principle, black hole complementarity, and loop quantum gravity, noting its distinctions and examining its limitations. Finally, we discuss observable implications of QMM, suggesting pathways for experimental evaluation, such as potential deviations from thermality in Hawking radiation and their effects on gravitational wave signals. The QMM hypothesis aims to provide a pathway towards resolving the Black Hole Information Paradox while contributing to broader discussions in quantum gravity and cosmology.         ",

    "abstract": "           Conductive ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) represent a promising topical system for the development of nanoelectronic components and device sensors to be operational at elevated temperatures. DWs show very different properties as compared to their hosting bulk crystal, in particular with respect to the high local electrical conductivity. The objective of this work is to demonstrate DW conductivity up to temperatures as high as 400 \u00b0C which extends previous studies significantly. Experimental investigation of the DW conductivity of charged, inclined DWs is performed using 5 mol% MgO-doped lithium niobate single crystals. Currentvoltage (IV) sweeps as recorded over repeated heating cycles reveal two distinct thermal activation energies for a given DW, with the higher of the activation energies only measured at higher temperatures. Depending on the specific sample, the higher activation energy is found above 160 \u00b0C to 230 \u00b0C. This suggests, in turn, that more than one type of defect/polaron is involved, and that the dominant transport mechanism changes with increasing temperature. First principles atomistic modelling suggests that the conductivity of inclined domain walls cannot be solely explained by the formation of a 2D carrier gas and must be supported by hopping processes. This holds true even at temperatures as high as 400 \u00b0C. Our investigations underline the potential to extend DW current based nanoelectronic and sensor applications even into the so-far unexplored temperature range up to 400 \u00b0C.         ",

    "abstract": "           Advances in ultra-intense laser technology have increased repetition rates and average power for chirped-pulse laser systems, which offers a promising solution for many applications including energetic proton sources. An important challenge is the need to optimize and control the proton source by varying some of the many degrees of freedom inherent to the laser-plasma interactions. Machine learning can play an important role in this task, as our work examines. Building on our earlier work in Desai et al. 2024, we generate a large $\\sim$1.5 million data point synthetic data set for proton acceleration using a physics-informed analytic model that we improved to include pre-pulse physics. Then, we train different machine learning methods on this data set to determine which methods perform efficiently and accurately. Generally, we find that quasi-real-time training of neural network models using single shot data from a kHz repetition rate ultra-intense laser system should typically be feasible on a single GPU. We also find that a less sophisticated model like a polynomial regression can be trained even faster and that the accuracy of these models is still good enough to be useful. We provide our source code and example synthetic data for others to test new machine learning methods and approaches to automated learning in this regime.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present a technique for detecting ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio fields using a three-photon Rydberg excitation scheme in a continuously laser cooled sample of Rb-87 atoms. By measuring Autler-Townes splitting, we demonstrate resonant detection of UHF fields with frequency range 500-900 MHz through probing F -> G transitions, achieving a lowest minimum detectable field of 2.5(6) mV/cm at 899 MHz. We also demonstrate continuous time detection of a modulated RF signal, with a 3 dB bandwidth of 4.7(4) kHz at a carrier frequency of 899 MHz. Our approach employs atom loss spectroscopy rather than electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), which enables detection whilst the atomic sample is simultaneously laser cooled. We investigate this operating regime to determine the feasibility of combining the benefits of reduced thermal dephasing (and subsequent increased sensitivity) of cold atoms with the continuous operation associated with thermal atoms. Our continuous time detection scheme provides an advantage over existing pulsed cold atom systems as we avoid the slow experimental duty cycles typically associated with replenishing the cold atom ensemble. We characterize the excitation scheme by varying laser detunings and analyze the impact and limitations due to various broadening mechanisms on the detection sensitivity.         ",

    "abstract": "           This study demonstrates the application of cosmic-ray muography as a non-invasive method to assess sediment accumulation and tidal influences in the Shanghai Outer Ring Tunnel, an immersed tube tunnel beneath the Huangpu River in Shanghai, China. A portable, dual-layer plastic scintillator detector was deployed to conduct muon flux scans along the tunnel's length and to continuously monitor muon flux to study tidal effects. Geant4 simulations validated the correlation between muon attenuation and overburden thickness, incorporating sediment, water, and concrete layers. Key findings revealed an 11\\% reduction in muon flux per meter of tidal water level increase, demonstrating a strong anti-correlation (correlation coefficient: -0.8) with tidal cycles. The results align with geotechnical data and simulations, especially in the region of interest, confirming muography's sensitivity to sediment dynamics. This work establishes muography as a robust tool for long-term, real-time monitoring of submerged infrastructure, offering significant advantages over conventional invasive techniques. The study underscores the potential for integrating muography into civil engineering practices to enhance safety and operational resilience in tidal environments.         ",

The pursuit of electromagnetic cloaking significantly advanced the field of metamaterials, yet achieving broadband, conformal cloaking for complex, non-trivial objects remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we introduce the concept of 'tailor-made metasurfaces' - machine-designed aperiodic structures optimized to suppress scattering from arbitrary objects by accounting for their layout, including resonant or large-scale features. Specifically, we demonstrated a wideband ~20% fractional bandwidth scattering suppression of more than 20-30 dB for various generic test objects, including randomly distributed wire meshes, spheres, and polygons. The demonstrated evolutionary optimization marks a leap forward in electromagnetic design, enabling the development of high-performance structures to meet complex technological demands.         ",

The clamp switch enables precise low-noise electric field control while allowing application of fast high-voltage ionization pulses through the same electrode(s), enabling atom detection via electric-field ionization and electron or ion counting. We outline the circuit design and analyze its noise suppression performance for both small and large input signals. In application examples, we employ the clamp switch to reduce the spectral width and increase the signal strength of a Rydberg line by a factor of two, to estimate the electric-field noise in the testing chamber, and to perform electric-field calibration using Rydberg Stark spectroscopy. The clamp switch improves coherence times and spectroscopic resolution in fundamental and applied quantum science research with Rydberg atoms.         ",

    "abstract": "           The educational value of a fully diagrammatic approach in a scientific field has never been explored. We present Quantum Picturalism (QPic), an entirely diagrammatic formalism for all of qubit quantum mechanics. This framework is particularly advantageous for young learners as a novel way to teach key concepts such as entanglement, measurement, and mixed-state quantum mechanics in a math-intensive subject. This eliminates traditional obstacles without compromising mathematical correctness - removing the need for matrices, vectors, tensors, complex numbers, and trigonometry as prerequisites to learning. Its significance lies in that a field as complex as Quantum Information Science and Technology (QIST), for which educational opportunities are typically exclusive to the university level and higher, can be introduced at high school level. In this study, we tested this hypothesis, examining whether QPic reduces cognitive load by lowering complex mathematical barriers while enhancing mental computation and conceptual understanding. The data was collected from an experiment conducted in 2023, whereby 54 high school students (aged 16-18) underwent 16 hours of training spread over eight weeks. The post-assessments illustrated promising outcomes in all three specific areas of focus: (1) whether QPic can alleviate technical barriers in learning QIST, (2) ensures that the content and teaching method are age appropriate, (3) increases confidence and motivation in science and STEM fields. There was a notable success rate in terms of teaching outcomes, with 82% of participants successfully passing an end-of-training exam and 48% achieving a distinction, indicating a high level of performance. The unique testing and training regime effectively reduced the technical barriers typically associated with traditional approaches, as hypothesized.         ",

    "abstract": "           Conventional autonomous quantum refrigerators rely on uncorrelated heat exchange between the working system and baths via two-body interactions enabled by single-photon transitions and positive-temperature work baths, inherently limiting their cooling performance. Here, we introduce distinct qutrit refrigerators that exploit correlated heat transfer via two-photon transitions with the hot and cold baths, yielding a genuine enhancement in performance over conventional qutrit refrigerators that employ uncorrelated heat transfer. These refrigerators achieve at least a twofold enhancement in cooling power and reliability compared to conventional counterparts. Moreover, we show that cooling power and reliability can be further enhanced simultaneously by several folds, even surpassing existing cooling limits, by utilizing a synthetic negative-temperature work bath. Such refrigerators can be realized by combining correlated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a four-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths via two independent two-photon transitions. Here, the composition of two work baths effectively creates a synthetic negative-temperature work bath under suitable parameter choices. Our results demonstrate that correlated heat transfers and baths with negative temperatures can yield thermodynamic advantages in quantum devices. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed refrigerators across various existing platforms.         ",

A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.         ",

    "abstract": "           We have designed a Micro-Ring Resonator (MRR) based device that allows for the post-selection of high order NOON states via heralding. NOON states higher than $N=2$ cannot be generated deterministically. By tuning the coupling parameters of the device we can minimize the amplitudes of the 'accidental' states to maximize the probability of obtaining the NOON state upon a successful heralding event. Our device can produce a 3-photon NOON state output with 100% certainty upon a successful heralding detection, which occurs with probability $\\frac{8}{27}$ for optimal tunable device parameters. A successful heralding event allows for non-destructive time of flight tracking of the NOON state thus establishing a significantly enhanced level of engineering control for integration of the NOON state into scalable systems for quantum sensing and metrology. We further discuss extensions of our technique to even higher NOON states having $N=4,5$.         ",

    "title": "Universal Structure of Computing Moments for Exact Quantum Dynamics: Application to Arbitrary System-Bath Couplings",
    "abstract": "           We introduce a general procedure for computing higher-order moments of correlation functions in open quantum systems, extending the scope of our recent work on Memory Kernel Coupling Theory (MKCT) [W. Liu, Y. Su, Y. Wang, and W. Dou, arXiv:2407.01923 (2024)]. This approach is demonstrated for arbitrary system-bath coupling that can be expressed as polynomial, $H_{SB} = \\hat{V} (\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 \\hat{q} + \\alpha_2 \\hat{q}^2+ \\dots)$, where we show that the recursive commutators of a system operator obey a universal hierarchy. Exploiting this structure, the higher-order moments are obtained by evaluating the expectation values of the system and bath operators separately, with bath expectation values derived from the derivatives of a generating function. We further apply MKCT to compute the dipole autocorrelation function for the spin-boson model with both linear and quadratic coupling, achieving agreement with the hierarchical equations of motion approach. Our findings suggest a promising path toward accurate dynamics for complex open quantum systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           XY models with continuous spin orientation play a pivotal role in understanding topological phase transitions and emergent frustration phenomena, such as superconducting and superfluid phase transitions. However, the complex energy landscapes arising from frustrated lattice geometries and competing spin interactions make these models computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we design a programmable photonic spin simulator capable of emulating XY models with tunable lattice geometries and spin couplings, allowing systematic exploration of their statistical behavior. We experimentally observe the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a square-lattice XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions, accurately determining its critical temperature. Expanding to frustrated systems, we implement the approach in triangular and honeycomb lattices, uncovering sophisticated phase transitions and frustration effects, which are consistent with theoretical predictions. This versatile platform opens avenues for probing unexplored XY model phenomena across diverse geometries and interaction schemes, with potential applications in solving complex optimization and machine learning problems.

    "abstract": "           We explore the potential of charge and spin conductance as well as charge and spin quantum noise and $\\Delta_T$ noise as probes to analyze and contrast Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states from Majorana bound states (MBS) in a one-dimensional metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction. YSR bound states, induced by magnetic impurities acting as spin-flippers within the superconducting gap, are distinct from MBS, which can also arise in systems with magnetic impurities, such as magnetic adatoms on superconductors, often leading to false positives in MBS detection. Replacing a trivial $s$-wave superconductor with a topological superconductor featuring triplet pairing, e.g., chiral-$p$ or spinless $p$-wave superconducting nanowire, we analyze and establish clear distinctions between YSR states and MBS. This work provides an unique signature for YSR states, demonstrating that charge or spin conductance as well as both charge and spin quantum noise, along their $\\Delta_T$ noise counterparts are effective in identifying YSR bound states and distinguishing them from MBS.
