    "abstract": "           Quantum computing applications in diverse domains are emerging rapidly. Given the limitations of classical computing techniques, the peculiarity of quantum circuits, which can observe quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum coherence, is remarkable. This capability enables them to achieve measurement sensitivities far beyond classical limits. Research on radical pair-based magnetoreception in migratory birds has been a focus area for quite some time. A quantum mechanics-based computing approach, thus unsurprisingly, identifies a scope of application. In this study, to observe the phenomenon, electron-nucleus spin quantum circuits for different geomagnetic fluxes have been simulated and run through IBM Qiskit quantum processing units with error mitigation techniques. The results of different quantum states are consistent, suggesting singlet-triplet mechanisms that can be emulated, resembling the environment-enabling flights of migratory birds through generations of the avian species. The four-qubit model emulating electron-nucleus systems mimicking the environmental complexity outcome shows the sensitiveness to change of magnetic flux index, high probability of singlet-triplet dynamics, and upholding radical pair model states by the purity of the sub-system and full system outcome of coherence, the hallmark of singlet state dominance. The work involved performing fifty quantum circuits for different magnetic field values, each with one thousand and twenty-four shots for measurement, either in the simulator or on real quantum hardware, and for two error mitigation techniques, preceded by a noise model of a simulator run.

    "abstract": "           Thermal diffusivity of solid materials is commonly measured using laser flash analysis. This technique involves applying a heat pulse to the front surface of a small sample of the material and calculating the thermal diffusivity from the resulting increase in temperature on the back surface. Current formulas for the thermal diffusivity are based on the assumption that heat is transported within the sample according to the standard heat equation. While this assumption is valid in most practical cases, it admits the non-physical property of infinite propagation speed, that is, the heat pulse applied at the front surface is instantaneously perceived at the back surface. This paper carries out a mathematical analysis to determine the effect of replacing the standard heat equation in laser flash analysis by the Cattaneo heat equation, which exhibits finite propagation speed through the inclusion of a relaxation time in the Fourier law. The main results of the paper include (i) analytical insights into the spatiotemporal behaviour of temperature within the sample and (ii) analytical formulas for determining the thermal diffusivity and relaxation time of the sample. Numerical experiments exploring and verifying the analytical results are presented with supporting MATLAB code made publicly available.         ",

In reality, the key metric for the effective operation of a circular collider is the integrated luminosity provided to the experiments, which can significantly differ from the theoretical capability regarding instantaneous luminosity of the accelerator. Several factors influence the collection of integrated luminosity, with the most critical being the duration of each physics fill.

    "abstract": "           The ultimate feature size is key in ultrafast laser material processing. A capacity to signiicantly exceed optical limits and to structure below 100nm is essential to advance ultrafast processing into the field of metamaterials. Such achievement requires to combine the control of optical near-fields and of material reactions, while preserving the exibility of long working distances, compatible with a mature laser process. Using sub-ps and ps non-diffractive Bessel beams, we demonstrate unprecedented feature sizes below a hundredth of the incident 1$\\mu$m wavelength over an extended focus depth of tens of $\\mu$m. Record features sizes, down to 7nm, result from self-generated near-field light components initiated by cavities induced by far-field radiation in a back-surface illumination geometry. This sustains the generation of more confined near-field evanescent components along the laser scan with nm pitch, perpendicular to the incident field direction, driving by local thermal ablation a super-resolved laser structuring process. The near-field pattern is replicated with high robustness, advancing towards a 10nm nanoscribing tool with a $\\mu$m-sized laser pen. The process is controllable by the field orientation. The non-diffractive irradiation develops evanescent fields over the focusing length, resulting in a high aspect ratio trenching with nm section and $\\mu$m depth. Higher energy doses trigger the self-organization of quasi-periodic patterns seeded by spatially modulated scattering, similarly to optical modelocking. A predictive multipulse simulation method validates the far-field-induced near-field electromagnetic scenario of void nanochannel growth and replication, indicating the processing range and resolution on the surface and in the depth.

Through analytical modeling and numerical verification, we show that the interplay between time-varying medium and cavity boundary conditions leads to amplification of specific waves followed by spatial mode selection. This engineered resonance mechanism enables insensitivity to initial wave source configuration and strong temporal disorder immunity. Our findings give a simple mechanism for exploiting narrow momentum bandgaps, and establish a foundation for developing high-quality temporal cavity lasers and advancing extreme temporal predictability in time-modulated systems.

Nevertheless, there is still no continuum mechanical model capable of describing the evolution of such damage. In this study, we develop a model that characterizes solid damage through a phase field variable governed by Allen-Cahn dynamics. The parameter of the model is defined by a conceptual mechanism: during Coulomb explosion, electron pressure surpasses the interatomic barrier potential, dissociates material from the solid surface as small equivalent particles and resulting in localized damage. The numerical simulation validates the model's availability and demonstrate its ability to predict damage morphology under varying laser conditions. This work advances the understanding of non-thermal ablation and provides a tool for optimizing ultrafast laser processing.         ",

They play a key role in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems by enabling efficient routing of multiple data channels over a single optical fiber and as a building block for various optical signal processing, computing, imaging, and spectroscopic applications. Recently, there has been growing interest in integrating AWGs in ferroelectric material platforms, as the platform simultaneously provide efficient electro-optic modulation capability and thus hold the promise for fully integrated WDM transmitters. To date, several demonstrations have been made in the X-cut thin-film lithium niobate ($\\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$) platform, yet, the large anisotropy of $\\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$ complicates the design and degrades the performance of the AWGs. To address this limitation, we use the recently developed photonic integrated circuits (PICs) based on thin-film lithium tantalate ($\\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$), a material with a similar Pockels coefficient as $\\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$ but significantly reduced optical anisotropy, as an alternative viable platform. In this work, we manufacture $\\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$ AWGs using deep ultraviolet lithography on a wafer-scale. The fabricated AWGs feature a channel spacing of 100 GHz, an insertion loss of < 4 dB and crosstalk of < -14 dB. In addition, we demonstrate a cyclic AWG, as well as a multiplexing and demultiplexing AWG pair for the first time on $\\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$ platform. The wafer-scale fabrication of these AWGs not only ensures uniformity and reproducibility, but also paves the way for realizing volume-manufactured integrated WDM transmitters in ferroelectric photonic integrated platforms.

The RSD is a candidate sensor to be used in future tracking detectors with the objective of obtaining '4D' tracking, where timing information can be used along with spatial hits during track finding. 4D tracking will be an essential part of any future lepton or hadron collider and may even be feasible at the HL-LHC. For applications at hadron colliders, RSD sensors must be able to operate in high fluence environments in order to provide 4D tracking. However, the effects of radiation on RSDs have not been extensively studied. In this study, RSDs were irradiated to $1.0$, $2.0$, and $3.5 \\times 10^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$ (1~MeV neutron equivalents) with both protons and neutrons. The sensors were then characterized electrically to study the acceptor removal and, for the first time in this doping concentration range, the donor removal. Then, the Transient Current Technique was used to begin investigating the signal charge sharing after irradiation. The results suggest an interesting trend between acceptor and donor removal, which is worthy of further study and could assist in improving radiation hardness of Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (LGADs).

While these transitions have been experimentally observed in ultracold atoms, acoustic systems, optical waveguides, and superconducting junctions, their interplay between quasiperiodic potential and long-range hopping remains unexplored experimentally. In this work, we report the observation of localization-delocalization transition induced by the hopping between the next-nearest neighboring sites using quasiperiodic photonic waveguides. Our findings demonstrate that increasing the next-nearest hopping strength induces a reentrant phase transition, where the system transitions from an initially extended phase into a localized phase before eventually returning to an extended phase. This remarkable interplay between hopping and quasiperiodic potential in the lattice models provides crucial insights into the mechanism of Anderson transition. Furthermore, our numerical simulation reveals that this phase transition exhibits a critical exponent of $\\nu \\simeq 1/3$, which is experimentally observable for system sizes $L\\sim10^3$ - $10^4$. These results establish a framework for direct observation of the Anderson transition and precise determination of its critical exponents, which can significantly advance our understanding of localization physics in quasiperiodic systems.

This work presents a practical numerical assessment of a hybrid quantum-classical approach to CFD based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). The inherently non-linear LBM equations are linearized via a Carleman expansion and solved using the quantum Harrow Hassidim Lloyd algorithm (HHL). We evaluate this method on three benchmark cases featuring different boundary conditions, periodic, bounceback, and moving wall, using statevector emulation on high-performance computing resources. Our results confirm the validity of the approach, achieving median error fidelities on the order of $10^{-3}$ and success probabilities sufficient for practical quantum state sampling.

This leads to a superposition of excited emissive states which decrease the emissive lifetime of the UCNP by a factor proportional to the square of the number of lanthanide ions which are coherently coupled. This results in a dramatic decrease in UCNP emission lifetime from the microsecond regime to the nanosecond regime.
