    "abstract": "           It remains a prime question of how to describe the optical properties of large molecular clusters accurately. Quantum chemical methods capture essential electronic details but are infeasible for entire clusters, while optical simulations handle cluster-scale effects but miss crucial quantum effects. To overcome such limitations, we apply here a multi-scale modeling approach, combining precise quantum chemistry calculations with Maxwell scattering simulations, to study the linear and nonlinear optical response of finite-size supramolecular gold-cysteine nanoparticles dispersed in water. In this approach, every molecular unit that forms the cluster is represented by a polarizability and a hyperpolarizability, and the overall response is obtained from solving an optical multiple scattering problem. We particularly demonstrate how important it is to accurately consider the environment of the individual molecular units when computing their polarizability and hyperpolarizability. In our quantum chemical simulations, we do so at the level of a static partial charge field that represents the presence of other molecular units. Without correctly considering these effects of the embedding, predictions would deviate from experimental observations even qualitatively. Our findings pave the way for more accurate predictions of the optical response of complex molecular systems, which is crucial for advancing applications in nanophotonics, biosensing, and molecular optoelectronics.

    "abstract": "           Bioconvection is a phenomenon caused by microorganisms with tactic properties. To effectively utilize bioconvection for industrial purposes, it is necessary to find a way to control it. In this study, we performed a three-dimensional numerical analysis of thermo-bioconvection generated by a suspension of chemotactic bacteria under unsteady heating conditions at the bottom. Under unsteady heating conditions, thermal convection and bioconvection coexist, and unsteady thermo-bioconvection occurs around plumes. When the frequency of the temperature fluctuation is low, thermo-bioconvection follows the temperature fluctuation. However, as the frequency increases, the ability of thermo-bioconvection to follow the temperature fluctuation deteriorates. A resonance phenomenon occurs at the frequency where the instability of the suspension owing to the density difference between the bacteria and water is maintained and where thermo-bioconvection can follow temperature fluctuations. At the resonance frequency, the transport characteristics of bacteria and oxygen throughout the entire region within the suspension improve significantly. As the amplitude of temperature fluctuations and thermal Rayleigh number increase, the interference between thermal convection and bioconvection intensifies, leading to a noticeable improvement in transport characteristics owing to the resonance phenomenon. At this time, the amplitude of temperature fluctuations and thermal Rayleigh number do not almost affect the resonance frequency. This study demonstrated the possibility of thermal control of transport properties in bioconvection.         ",

    "abstract": "           Coating thickness measurement and inspection of defects beneath optically opaque surfaces are among the most promising commercial applications of the terahertz (THz) imaging technology. However, there are two main sources of complexity in THz spectral measurements that have resulted in reduced accuracy and high uncertainty in the determination of coating thicknesses. These factors include: 1. The need for \\textit{a priori} knowledge of the complex index of refraction of each coating layer, and 2. The complex and polarization-sensitive reflectivity of samples with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) substrates. In this paper, we propose a combined hardware and software solution to address these two limitations. We employ the polarimetric version of our Portable HAndheld Spectral Reflection (PHASR) Scanner and use a novel training model on time-of-flight measurements obtained by sparse deconvolution of the THz time-domain pulses. Our method does not depend on separate measurement of the index of refraction of the coating layers; rather, it relies on a physics-based linear model, trained using a small subset of the sample data. We show that thickness measurements with mean square error of about 10 $\\mu$m and accuracy of more than 92\\% can be achieved when the useful bandwidth of the scanner is limited to about 1.5 THz using photoconductive antenna emitters and detectors. We show that the anisotropic response of the carbon fiber bundles and the weave pattern structure of the substrate can significantly influence the accuracy of the coating measurement, and therefore a polarimetric imaging approach should be used for inspection of similar samples.

    "abstract": "           In recent years, uncertainty-aware full waveform inversion (FWI) has received increasing attention, with a growing emphasis on producing informative uncertainty estimates alongside inversion results. Bayesian inference methods--particularly Monte Carlo-based approaches--have been widely employed to quantify uncertainty. However, these techniques often require extensive posterior sampling, resulting in high computational costs. To address this challenge and enable efficient uncertainty quantification in FWI, we introduce an uncertainty-aware FWI framework--EKI-GRFs-FWI--that integrates Gaussian random fields (GRFs) with the ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) algorithm. This approach jointly infers subsurface velocity fields and provides reliable uncertainty estimates in a computationally efficient manner. The EKI algorithm leverages a derivative-free update mechanism and employs effective stopping criteria to ensure rapid convergence, making it suitable for large-scale inverse problems. Meanwhile, GRFs incorporate prior knowledge of spatial smoothness and correlation length scales, enabling the generation of physically plausible initial ensembles for EKI. Numerical results demonstrate that EKI-GRFs-FWI yields reasonably accurate velocity reconstructions while delivering informative uncertainty estimates.         ",

    "abstract": "           A new approach for solving the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography is introduced, which interpolates between the well-known diffusion approximation and a radiative transfer equation based model. The proposed formulation combines a spatial finite volume scheme with a truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable for the radiative transfer equation. The finite volume scheme provides a natural and simple approach for representing piecewise constant image data modelled using transport equations. The truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable facilitates the interpolation between the diffusion approximation at low order, and the full radiative transfer model as the truncation limit $N\\rightarrow\\infty$. It is therefore possible to tune the precision of the model to the demands of the imaging application, taking $N=1$ for cases when the diffusion approximation would suffice and increasing the number of terms otherwise. We will then utilise the non-linear optimisation functionality of Matlab to address the corresponding large-scale nonlinear inverse problem using gradient based quasi-Newton minimisation via the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Numerical experiments for two test-cases of increasing complexity and resolution will be presented, and the effect of logarithmically rescaling the problem data on the accuracy of the reconstructed solutions will be investigated. We will focus on cases where the diffusion approximation is not sufficient to demonstrate that our approach can provide significant accuracy gains with only a modest increase in the number of Fourier terms included.

As the thickness of the three types of targets increases and under the same polarized laser, the average energy, maximum energy and energy conversion efficiency of Th ions decrease as it is well-known, and except for the circularly polarized laser hit on the conical target with angularity on the left, the Th ion beam emittance also decreases, while its beam intensity increases conversely. The linearly polarized laser, compared to the circularly polarized laser with the same laser intensity, exhibits higher beam intensity, beam emittance and energy conversion efficiency for the same type and thickness of Th target. The conical Th target with angularity on the left and intermediate thickness, compared to the flat target and conical target with angularity on the right of the same thickness, possesses both higher ion average energy up to 7 GeV and virtually the same beam intensity up to 0.8 MA under the linearly polarized laser. The results lead us to an easier way of controlling laser-accelerated high-quality heavy ion beam by switching to an optimal laser-target configuration scheme, which may enable the synthesis of superheavy nuclei in a high-temperature and high-density extreme plasma environment in astronuclear physics.

    "abstract": "           A potential approach for demonstrating quantum advantage is using quantum computers to simulate fermionic systems. Quantum algorithms for fermionic system simulation usually involve the Hamiltonian evolution and measurements. However, in the second quantization representation, the number of terms in many fermion-system Hamiltonians, such as molecular Hamiltonians, is substantial, approximately $\\mathcal{O}(N^4)$, where $N$ is the number of molecular orbitals. Due to this, the computational resources required for Hamiltonian evolution and expectation value measurements could be excessively large. To address this, we introduce a grouping strategy that partitions these $\\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ Hamiltonian terms into $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ groups, with the terms in each group mutually commuting. Based on this grouping method, we propose a parallel Hamiltonian evolution scheme that reduces the circuit depth of Hamiltonian evolution by a factor of $N$. Moreover, our grouping measurement strategy reduces the number of measurements needed to $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, whereas the current best grouping measurement schemes require $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ measurements. Additionally, we find that measuring the expectation value of a group of Hamiltonian terms requires fewer repetitions than measuring a single term individually, thereby reducing the number of quantum circuit executions. Our approach saves a factor of $N^3$ in the overall time for Hamiltonian evolution and measurements, significantly decreasing the time required for quantum computers to simulate fermionic systems.

    "abstract": "           Quantum error mitigation (QEM) strategies are essential for improving the precision and reliability of quantum chemistry algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Reference-state error mitigation (REM) is a cost-effective chemistry-inspired QEM method that performs exceptionally well for weakly correlated problems. However, the effectiveness of REM is often limited when applied to strongly correlated systems. Here, we introduce multireference-state error mitigation (MREM), an extension of REM that systematically captures quantum hardware noise in strongly correlated ground states by utilizing multireference states. A pivotal aspect of MREM is using Givens rotations to efficiently construct quantum circuits to generate multireference states. To strike a balance between circuit expressivity and noise sensitivity, we employ compact wavefunctions composed a few dominant Slater determinants. These truncated multireference states, engineered to exhibit substantial overlap with the target ground state, can effectively enhance error mitigation in variational quantum eigensolver experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MREM through comprehensive simulations of molecular systems $\\mathrm{H_2O, ~N_2, ~and ~F_2}$, underscoring its ability to realize significant improvements in computational accuracy compared to the original REM method. MREM broadens the scope of error mitigation to encompass a wider variety of molecular systems, including those exhibiting pronounced electron correlation.         ",

First, scalar quantum mechanics of photons operating with the photon wave functions is discussed. Using the first quantization, the wave equation, the Schroedinger-like equations, and the Dirac equation for photons are derived. Then, vector quantum mechanics of photons is introduced, which defines the electromagnetic vector fields. Using the first quantization, the Maxwell equations for photons in magneto-dielectric medium are obtained. Since the photon electric and magnetic fields satisfy the Maxwell equations, all what is known about the classical optical fields can be directly transferred to photons demonstrating their quantum diversity. Relationships between the scalar and vector quantum mechanics of photons and between the Dirac and Maxwell equations are analyzed. To describe the propagation of photons in dispersive media novel equations are introduced.         ",

Data collection in ALPS II is underway utilizing a heterodyne-based detection scheme. A complementary run for confirmation or as an alternative method is planned using single photon detection, requiring a sensor capable of measuring low-energy photons ($1064\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $1.165\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) with high efficiency (higher than $50\\,\\%$) and a low background rate (below $7.7\\cdot10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cps}$). To meet these requirements, we are investigating a tungsten Transition Edge Sensor (TES) provided by NIST, which operates in its superconducting transition region at millikelvin temperatures. This sensor exploits the drastic change in resistance caused by the absorption of a single photon. We find that the background observed in the setup with a fiber-coupled TES is consistent with Black Body Radiation (BBR) as the primary background contributor. A framework was developed to simulate BBR propagation to the TES under realistic conditions. The framework not only allows the exploration of background reduction strategies, such as improving the TES energy resolution, but also reproduces, within uncertainties, the spectral distribution of the observed background. These simulations have been validated with experimental data, in agreement with the modeled background distribution, and show that the improved energy resolution reduces the background rate in the $1064\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ signal region by one order of magnitude, to approximately $10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cps}$. However, this rate must be reduced further to meet the ALPS II requirements.         ",

    "abstract": "           Technologies for manipulating single atoms and molecules have advanced drastically in the past decades. Due to their excellent controllability of internal states, atoms and molecules serves as one of the ideal platforms as quantum systems. One major research direction in atomic systems is the precise determination of energy differences between two energy levels in atoms. This field, known as precision measurement, is symbolized by the remarkable fractional uncertainty of $10^{-18}$ or lower achieved in the state-of-the-art atomic clocks. Two-level systems in atoms are sensitive to various external fields and can therefore be function as quantum sensors. The effect of these fields manifests as energy shifts in the two-level system. Traditionally, such shifts are induced by electric or magnetic fields, as recognized even before the advent of the precision spectroscopy with lasers. However, with high-precision measurements, energy shifts can also be caused by hypothetical fields weakly coupled to ordinary matter, or by small effects mediated by massive particles, which are conventionally dealt with in the field of nuclear and particle physics. In most cases, the atomic systems as quantum sensors have not been sensitive enough to detect such effects. Instead, experiments searching for these interactions have placed constraints on coupling constants, except in a few cases where effects are predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. Nonetheless, measurements and searches for these effects in atomic systems have led to the emergence of a new field of physics. In some cases, they open new parameter spaces to explore in conventionally investigated topics, e.g., dark matter, fifth force, CP-violation, and other physics beyond the Standard Model.         ",

The latter finally absorbs the energy and emits an electron which exhibits the aforementioned circular dichroism in its angular distribution. We study the process on the basis of the retarded dipole--dipole interaction and report an asymptotic analytic expression for the distance-dependent chiral asymmetry of the photoelectron as induced by resonant interatomic Coulombic decay for random line-of-sight and acceptor orientations. In the nonretarded limit, the predicted chiral asymmetry is reversed as compared to that of a direct photoelectron circular dichroism of the molecule.         ",

The lattice configuration of these structures significantly influences the ability to achieve sharp turns in the propagation path.

Previous research on kagome lattices in photonic topological insulators has primarily focused on valley types of insulators. This article introduces a spin topological metasurface based on the kagome lattice and its unit cell, enabling a broad range of sharp turns and propagation paths. The unit cell is compared to its hexagonal and 60-degree rhombic counterparts, and a parametric study of its dimensions is conducted. As a result of this research, a new X-band leaky-wave antenna designed in the kagome lattice with an armchair arrangement interface has been developed. This antenna provides two forward and two backward beams, each pair achieving an approximately 50-degree scan within the 8.8 to 11.1 GHz bandwidth.         ",

The Berry curvature, a central element of this framework, is well established for its key role in electronic transport, whereas its impact on the optical properties of crystals remains comparatively unexplored. Here, we derive a relation between optical activity, defined by the gyration tensor, and the k-derivatives of the Berry curvature at optical resonances in the Brillouin zone. We systematically determine which of these derivatives are non-zero or constrained by symmetry across all time-reversal-invariant crystal classes. In particular, we analytically demonstrate that circular dichroism emerges in chiral crystal classes as a result of a non-zero Berry curvature k-derivative along the optical axis, and we interpret this finding based on the conservation of angular momentum in light-matter interactions.
