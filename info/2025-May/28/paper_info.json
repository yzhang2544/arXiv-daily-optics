    "abstract": "           We examine the quantum coherence properties of tubulin heterodimers in the Microtubule (MT) lattice. In the cavity-MT model proposed by the authors, according to which the MT interiors are modeled as high-Q quantum-electrodynamics cavities, decoherence-resistant entangled states have been argued to emerge under physiological conditions, with decoherence times of order $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ s. The latter is the result of strong electric-dipole interactions of tubulin dimers with ordered-water dipole quanta in the MT interior. We re-interpret the classical nonlinear (pseudospin) $\\sigma$-models, describing the emergent dynamics of solitonic excitations in such systems, as representing quantum coherent (or possibly pointer) states, arising from the incomplete collapse of quantum-coherent dipole states. These solitons mediate dissipation-free energy transfer across the MT networks. We underpin logic-gate-like behavior through MT-associated proteins and detail how these structures may support scalable, ambient-temperature quantum computation, with the fundamental unit of information storage being a quDit associated with the basic unit of the MT honeycomb lattice. We describe in detail the decision-making process, after the action of an external stimulus, during which optimal path selection for energy-loss-free signal and information transport across the MT network emerges. Finally, we propose experimental pathways, including Rabi-splitting spectroscopy and entangled surface plasmon probes, to experimentally validate our predictions for MT-based, scalable quantum computation.

    "title": "Measuring deviations from a perfectly circular cross-section of an optical nanofiber at the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m scale",
    "abstract": "           Tapered optical fibers (TOFs) with sub-wavelength-diameter waists, known as optical nanofibers, are powerful tools for interfacing quantum emitters and nanophotonics. These applications demand stable polarization of the fiber-guided light field. However, the linear birefringence resulting from \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m-scale deviations in the nanofiber's ideally circular cross-section can lead to significant polarization changes within millimeters of light propagation. Here, we experimentally investigate such deviations using two in-situ approaches. First, we measure the resonance frequencies of hundreds of flexural modes along the nanofiber, which exhibit splitting due to the non-circular cross section. By analyzing the mean resonance frequencies of each pair and the corresponding frequency splitting, we conclude that the nanofiber can be well described as having an elliptical cross-section with a mean radius of 255.6(9) nm, where the semi-axes differ by only about 2\u00c5. Second, we monitor the polarization of the guided light field by imaging the light scattered out of the nanofiber and observe a periodic polarization change along it. From the linear birefringence due to the elliptical cross-section, we infer a comparable difference in the semi-axes as the first method, and determine the orientation of the polarization eigenaxes. Our work is crucial for any fundamental or applied study that requires a well-controlled interaction between guided light and matter, in particular for quantum memories, frequency conversion, or lasing that require a large interaction length.

    "abstract": "           The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) is a heavy-ion experiment designed to study nuclear matter at the highest baryonic density. For high-statistics measurements of rare probes, event rates of up to 10 MHz are targeted. The experiment, therefore, requires fast and radiation-hard detectors, self-triggered detector front-ends, free-streaming readout architecture, and online event reconstruction. The Silicon Tracking System (STS) is the main tracking detector of CBM, designed to reconstruct the trajectories of charged particles with efficiency larger than 95%, a momentum resolution better than 2% for particle momenta larger than 1 GeV/c inside a 1 Tm magnetic field, and to identify complex decay topologies. It comprises 876 double-sided silicon strip modules arranged in 8 tracking stations. A prototype of this detector, consisting of 12 modules arranged in three tracking stations, is installed in the mini-CBM demonstrator. This experimental setup is a small-scale precursor to the full CBM detector, composed of sub-units of all major CBM systems installed on the SIS18 beamline. In various beam campaigns taken between 2021 and 2024, heavy ion collisions at 1-2 AGeV with an average collision rate of 500 kHz have been measured. This allows for the evaluation of the operational performance of the STS detector, including time and position resolution, hit reconstruction efficiency, charge distribution, signal-to-noise ratio, and its potential for track and vertex reconstruction.

In particular, we address two main issues: the challenges encountered in properly converging quantum dynamics calculations, even when a reduced-dimensionality molecular model is used; the emergence of a coherent oscillatory behavior in the formation of the trans isomer upon photoexcitation of cis-PSB3. The two issues are strictly related, since only upon reliable convergence, the simulated dynamics is able to capture the large amplitude motion associated to the torsion around the reactive bond, typical of photoisomerizations, which is due to the large amount of kinetic energy acquired by the vibrational modes after light excitation.

The electric field inside the SBND-TPC may have distortions due to a number of reasons, such as the space charge effect. The space charge effect comes from the abundance of cosmic rays that ionize the argon, producing copious positive argon ions. In this case, we need an alternative solution to determine the electric field distortion inside the TPC volume and compensate for the possible distortion in the spatial information. The UV Laser system is one such attempt to determine the electric field distortion. By utilising a high energy ultraviolet laser beam, the system can map the spatial distortions within the TPC volume and provide the necessary corrections to ensure accurate spatial and calorimetric measurements.

However, the development of robust and scalable optical packaging solutions remains a major challenge. Efficient fiber-to-chip coupling is essential for minimizing loss and enabling high optical bandwidth, key requirements for photonic computing. Here, we introduce a novel plug-and-play solution for fiber-to-PIC connections using female multi-fiber termination push-on cables and additively fabricate the alignment counterpart on the circuit via two-photon polymerization. We develop 3D out-of-plane couplers, offering a peak transmission of -0.41 dB and broadband performance with losses below 0.55 dB across the 1500-1600 nm range. Integration of the couplers with the plug-and-play solution adds in average only 0.37+-0.12 dB of loss, setting a record in passive out-of-plane packaging solution with losses of 0.78 dB, as well as -0.5 dB bandwidth greater than 100 nm. We characterize the reproducibility of this out-of-plane packaging solution in terms of losses, as well as bandwidth by interfacing a 17-port photonic circuit for incoherent photonic computing. The high bandwidth of the packaging is crucial to couple the full 100 nm bandwidth spectrum of a superluminescent light emitting diode, which consequently enables low noise computing at 17.6 GBaud. Our concept enables multiport, passive and reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit packaging providing reliability and versatility driving photonic packaging towards the scalability and robustness of electric chip packaging.

A key objective of this research area is to develop tunable photon sources that not only enhance the performance but also offer dynamic functionalities. However, the realization of compact and robust photon sources with precise and wide range tunability remains a long-standing challenge. Moreover, the lack of an effective approach to integrate nanoscale photon sources with dynamic systems has hindered tunability beyond mere spectral adjustments, such as simultaneous polarization control. Here we propose a platform based on quantum emitter (QE) embedded metasurfaces (QEMS) integrated with a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-positioned microcavity, enabling on-chip multi-degree control of solid-state photon sources. Taking advantages of MEMS-QEMS, we show that typically broadband room-temperature emission from nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy centres can be narrowed to 3.7 nm and dynamically tuned with angstrom resolution. Furthermore, we design a wavelength-polarization-multiplexed QEMS and demonstrate polarization-resolved control of the MEMS-QEMS emission in a wide wavelength range (650 nm to 700 nm) along with polarization switching at sub-millisecond timescales. We believe that the proposed MEMS-QEMS platform can be adapted for most existing QEs, significantly expanding their room-temperature capabilities and thereby enhancing their potential for advanced photonic applications.

The process and patterns of synchronisation are highly influenced by initial conditions and network topology. Synchronisation follows a network's hierarchal structure; developing first at a local level before conglomeration of local clusters typically drives synchronisation at a global scale. The structure and influence of global and local features play a key role in node synchronisation. These differing insights are shown to be uncovered through eigenspectra analyses of ring networks. These network topologies exhibit complex patterns of stable and unstable synchronisation - despite apparently simple coupling schemes - as well as distinctive spectral fingerprints. Intersecting ring networks, with a common focal point, combine to produce hubs of high connectivity at the intersections whose spectral analyses can denote the characteristics and distinctions of structure and influence. The adjacency eigenspectrum detects salient network structures, for example hubs of high connectivity, whilst the Laplacian spectrum indentifies the relative influence of nodes due to their associated spanning trees within the network constituent structures.

Optical frequency division (OFD) of ultra-stable optical references produce the lowest noise microwaves, but typically rely on ultra-low-expansion cavities, self-referenced frequency combs, pulse interleaving, and high-end photodetectors. In contrast, electro-optic frequency division (eOFD) offers a streamlined alternative in which an electro-optic (EO) comb is generated from a microwave source and stabilized to an optically carried terahertz (opto-terahertz) reference. eOFD has already demonstrated comparable phase noise to OFD at 10, 20, and 40 GHz when using division ratios from references spanning over 1 THz, requiring broad EO comb spectra to bridge between optical signals. Generating such broad spectra often demands complex techniques such as cascaded modulators, pulse compression, and nonlinear fiber. We demonstrate a compact, low-noise 300 GHz opto-terahertz reference utilizing a dual-wavelength Brillouin laser within a total system volume of 20 liters. The 300 GHz phase noise of this system is transferred to a 10 GHz dielectric resonant oscillator via eOFD using a simple architecture that could be miniaturized. The resulting microwave signal achieves phase noise levels of -130 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz, -150 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz, and -170 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz. This architecture drastically simplifies eOFD while maintaining state-of-the-art phase noise.         ",

Additionally, a metallic direct laser-written antenna structure next to the fiber facet allows efficient microwave manipulation of NV center spins. The sensor achieves a shot-noise limited magnetic field sensitivity of $5.9 \\mathrm{nT}/ \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ using a $15 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$-sized microdiamond at a microwave power of $50 \\mathrm{mW}$ and optical power of $2.15 \\mathrm{mW}$. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-fiber concept that enables, in combination with a direct laser-written structure, independent guiding of excitation and fluorescence light and thus reduces background autofluorescence. While the demonstrated sensitivity is achieved using a single-fiber configuration, the dual-fiber approach provides a path towards integrating smaller diamonds, where autofluorescence would otherwise limit performance. We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments, opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are necessary.

    "abstract": "           Emerging two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer a promising platform for on-chip integrated photonics because of their unique optical and electronic properties. Their naturally passivated surfaces make them highly tolerant to lattice mismatch, enabling seamless heterogeneous integration by stacking different van der Waals materials, a crucial step in the development of advanced photonic devices. Here, we demonstrate the use of an inverse design wavelength demultiplexing waveguides for on-chip sorting and routing of distinct photoluminescence from the heterojunction formed by WS2 and WSe2 monolayers. The integrated nanophotonic chip splits and sorts excitonic emission into individual waveguides at room temperature. Our demonstration opens up new perspectives for integrating light sources in van der Waals materials with functional integrated photonics, offering a versatile platform for both fundamental research and practical applications.

    "title": "Experimental evidence of a strange nonchaotic attractor in a Nd:YVO4 laser with saturable absorber",
    "abstract": "           The diode-pumped Nd: Vanadate laser is one of the most widely used lasers in the near-infrared range. Using passive Q-switching with a Cr:YAG saturable absorber (SA), it generates nanosecond pulses at tens of kilohertz. This laser is known to exhibit low-dimensional deterministic chaos. In this letter, we present experimental evidence of a strange nonchaotic attractor (SNA). SNAs exhibit complex dynamical behavior that is neither periodic nor chaotic, making them difficult to detect in real-world systems. They are typically observed in systems modeled by equations and arise through a route to chaos. By experimentally obtaining time series of two laser variables, we reconstruct the underlying attractor. For a certain position of the SA, we find that all Lyapunov exponents are negative and that the energy spectra exhibit a broad frequency range, indicating that the attractor is nonchaotic and lacks periodicity. Using Higuchi's method, we estimate the fractal dimension df and find that 13% of the nonchaotic time series exhibit a well-defined non-integer df, confirming the presence of an SNA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental observation of a strange nonchaotic attractor in a complex optical system.         ",

    "abstract": "           Ionic conduction in solids that exceeds 1 mS/cm is predicted to involve collective phonon-ion interactions in the crystal lattice. Here, we use theory and experiment to measure the possible contribution of collective phonon-ion modes to Li+ migration in Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO). The ab initio calculations predict that the targeted excitation of individual TiO6 rocking modes can lead to a three order of magnitude increase in the Li+ jump rate as compared to the excitation of single vibrational modes in the lattice associated with heating. Experimentally, coherently driving the TiO6 rocking via terahertz (THz) illumination leads to a ten-fold decrease in the normalized impedance compared to the excitation of acoustic and optical phonons that are associated with heating. These findings provide new insights into phonon-coupled ion migration mechanisms and material design rules for ion conductors and opto-ionic materials.         ",

    "title": "Neural Canonical Transformations for Quantum Anharmonic Solids of Lithium",
    "abstract": "           Lithium is a typical quantum solid, characterized by cubic structures at ambient pressure. As the pressure increases, it forms more complex structures and undergoes a metal-to-semiconductor transformation, complicating theoretical and experimental analyses. We employ the neural canonical transformation approach, an \\textit{ab initio} variational method based on probabilistic generative models, to investigate the quantum anharmonic effects in lithium solids at finite temperatures. This approach combines a normalizing flow for phonon excited-state wave functions with a probabilistic model for the occupation of energy levels, optimized jointly to minimize the free energy. Our results indicate that quantum anharmonicity lowers the \\textit{bcc}-\\textit{fcc} transition temperature compared to classical molecular dynamics predictions. At high pressures, the predicted fractional coordinates of lithium atoms in the \\textit{cI16} structure show good quantitative agreement with experimental observations. Finally, contrary to previous beliefs, we find that the poor metallic \\textit{oC88} structure is stabilized by the potential energy surface obtained via high-accuracy electronic structure calculations, rather than thermal or quantum nuclear effects.
