    "abstract": "           Stress-optic modulators are emerging as a necessary building block of photonic integrated circuits tasked with controlling and manipulating classical and quantum optical systems. While photonic platforms such as lithium niobate and silicon on insulator have well developed modulator ecosystems, silicon nitride so far does not. As silicon nitride has favorable optical properties, such as ultra-low-loss and a large optical transparency window, a rich ecosystem of potential photonic integrated circuits are therefore inhibited. Here we demonstrate a traveling wave optically broadband acousto-optic spiral modulator architecture at a wavelength of 1550 nm using 90 nm thick silicon nitride waveguides and demonstrate their use in an optomechanical sensing system. The spiral weaves the light repeatedly through the acoustic field up to 38 times, factoring in the time evolution of the acoustic field during the light's transit through spirals up to 26 cm in length. These modulators avoid heterogeneous integration, release processes, complicated fabrication procedures, and modifications of the commercial foundry fabricated photonic layer stack by exploiting ultra-low-loss waveguides to enable long phonon-photon interaction lengths required for efficient modulation. The design allows for thick top oxide cladding of 4 $\\mu$m such that the low loss optical properties of thin silicon nitride can be preserved, ultimately achieving a $V_\\pi$ of 8.98 V at 704 MHz with 1.13 dB of insertion loss. Our modulators are the first optically broadband high frequency acousto-optic modulators on thin silicon nitride, and the novel architecture is accessible to any low loss photonic platform. We demonstrate an immediate use case for these devices in a high-Q optomechanical sensing system.         ",

    "abstract": "           Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a powerful wave-based imaging technique, but its inherent ill-posedness and non-convexity lead to local minima and poor convergence. Regularization methods stabilize FWI by incorporating prior information and enforcing structural constraints like smooth variations or piecewise-constant behavior. Among them, Tikhonov regularization promotes smoothness, while total variation (TV) regularization preserves sharp boundaries. However, in the context of FWI, we highlight two key shortcomings of these regularization methods. First, subsurface model parameters (P- and S-wave velocities, density) often exhibit complex geological formations with sharp discontinuities separating distinct layers, while parameters within each layer vary smoothly. Neither Tikhonov nor TV regularization alone can effectively constrain such piecewise-smooth structures. Second, and more critically, when the initial model is far from the true model, these regularization assumptions can lead to a local minimum. To address these issues, we propose adaptive Tikhonov-TV (TT) regularization, which decomposes the model into smooth and blocky components, enabling robust recovery of piecewise-smooth structures. Implemented within the ADMM framework, TT regularization incorporates an automated balancing strategy based on robust statistical analysis. Numerical experiments on acoustic and elastic FWI using benchmark geological models demonstrate that TT regularization significantly improves convergence and reconstruction accuracy compared to Tikhonov and TV regularization when applied separately. We show that for complex models and remote initial models, both Tikhonov and TV regularization tend to converge to local minima, whereas TT regularization effectively mitigates cycle skipping through its adaptive combination of the two regularization strategies.

    "abstract": "           We investigate how to reliably remove unwanted global phase windings in gain-based optical oscillator networks, thereby ensuring convergence to the true synchronized configuration corresponding to the XY Hamiltonian's global minimum. Focusing on one-dimensional rings and two-dimensional toroidal lattices, we show that two key strategies greatly enhance the probability of reaching the defect-free state. First, operating at a low effective injection rate just above threshold, exploits the amplitude degree of freedom, allowing the system to form transient zero-amplitude holes: instantons in one dimension, or vortex-antivortex rarefaction pulses in two-dimensional space, that enable phase slips. Second, preparing the initial condition with amplitude or phase inhomogeneities can directly seed these amplitude collapses and prevent the system from getting trapped in higher-energy states with nonzero winding. Using the Stuart--Landau and Ginzburg--Landau equations as models for fast-reservoir lasers, we derive analytic and numerical evidence that even relatively minor amplitude dips can trigger global unwinding in 1D. We further demonstrate that the pump's slow annealing favours these amplitude-driven events, leading to improved success in finding the globally coherent ground state. These findings highlight the critical role of amplitude freedom in analogue solvers for XY optimization problems, showing how local amplitude suppression provides a direct route to ejecting topological defects.

    "abstract": "           The impact of radio frequency (RF) power on columnar and filamentary modes of very low frequency (VLF) plasma within pores is investigated in this work. The 12.5 kHz VLF discharge under various RF powers (13.56 MHz) was analyzed using optical photography and current-voltage measurements. Two-dimensional electron densities were derived using optical emission spectroscopy combined with collisional radiation modeling methods. It is found that RF power and very low frequency voltage (VVLF) significantly influence the plasma and its discharge modes within the 200 {\\mu}m pore. Under low VVLF conditions, the plasma is more intense within the pore, and the discharge mode is columnar discharge. With increasing RF power, the reciprocal motion of electrons counteracts the local enhancement effect of columnar discharge, the discharge transforms into RF discharge, the pore is completely wrapped by the sheath, and the plasma inside is gradually quenched. Under high VVLF conditions, the electron density within the pore is low and the discharge mode is filamentary discharge. RF introduction reduces plasma intensity within the pores firstly. As RF power increases, more ion trapping in the pore increases the field strength distortion and enhances the plasma intensity inside the pore, this enhancement effects becomes more obvious with increasing RF power. In addition, the above effects were observed for all pore widths from 100 um to 1000 um. These findings provide key insights for controlling plasma in pores and offer new methodologies for plasma technology applications.         ",

The temporal MC method based on estimated parameters from spatial MC, gives a close estimation of the experimentally observed atom-number evolution in ODT.

Yet, it remains challenging due to the dielectric transparency and metal loss in optical and near-infrared regimes. Here, we present a rotated hexagonal air cavity embedded in an Ag-air-Ag waveguide. Under near-infrared excitation, evanescent waves tunnel into the cavity. In addition to the whispering gallery mode and surface plasmon polaritons, the cavity also induces Fabry-P\u00e9rot (FP) resonance, whose orientation is tunable via cavity rotation. Thus, our cavity possesses much stronger field confinement and higher Q than a circular cavity lacking FP resonance. The waveguide exhibits suppressed backward reflection filtering and Fano-type lineshapes. Then, integrating a silicon cylinder into the cavity, we demonstrate linear tuning of Mie resonances via radius adjustment. When the electric dipole (ED) resonance is excited, energy is predominantly confined within the cylinder. Different Mie modes will change the orientation of the FP resonance. Furthermore, the hybrid modes with ED resonance induce the third-harmonic wave of green light. These findings offer a promising strategy for designing high-Q air cavities for next-generation multifunctional electro-optical devices.         ",

    "abstract": "           Hyperbolic metamaterials (HMM) are artificially engineered materials that exhibit hyperbolic dispersion of light propagating through them. These have been extensively studied for tailoring light propagation. Most studies use an effective medium approach that is extremely useful, though it misses out on properties that can arise from the microscopic details of the HMM. In particular, the HMM can have cavity-like modes, and it is important to understand such modes and their relevance in light propagation and coupling of HMM to quantum emitters. In this work, we bring out the cavity-like modes of the silver nanowire-alumina two-dimensional HMM, which remain on top of the broad response of the HMM. These modes define the characteristic reflection spectra. The observed resonances and their widths are in good agreement with our simulations. These well-defined modes occur even though the metallic part of the HMM has Ohmic losses. Then, we present experimental results on the coupling of quantum emitters to the cavity-like modes of the HMM. We present results for both steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence. Using these, we extract the corresponding Purcell factors for radiative rate enhancement. Theoretical analyses of the experimental data allow the determination of the cavity coupling parameters and mode volumes. These experimental results are confirmed by the FDTD calculations for the HMM mode volume.

However, OFDFT remains limited by the difficulty of formulating accurate kinetic-energy density functionals. In this paper, we substantially enhance the accuracy of OFDFT energies and densities by tuning, during density initialization, the parameter $\\mu$ of the APBEK functional, which arises in the second-order gradient expansion of the kinetic energy for semiclassical neutral atoms. We augment this parameterized APBEK functional with two physically-motivated, non-empirical corrections derived from Kato's cusp condition and the virial theorem. The resulting functional, which we call MuAPBEK, is benchmarked against Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) on atoms, organic molecules from the QM9 dataset, and the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. MuAPBEK achieves much lower energy errors than standard APBEK and Thomas-Fermi-von-Weizsacker functionals, even when the latter two are evaluated on converged KSDFT densities. Its mean absolute energy errors on atoms and molecules are 161 and 122 kcal/mol, respectively, indicating that MuAPBEK's errors do not scale with system size. MuAPBEK also yields accurate densities, with a mean integrated absolute density error of 1.8 electrons for molecules. Importantly, one step of our density optimization scheme is at least ten times faster than a single KSDFT self-consistent field cycle and exhibits a lower-order computational time complexity of $O(N^{1.96})$ with respect to system size, $N$. Our results indicate that highly-accurate OFDFT for large-scale quantum simulations beyond the practical limits of KSDFT is within reach.         ",

Integrated electro-optic modulators offer a compact and efficient solution, but extending their operation into the millimeterwave (mmWave) and terahertz regimes is difficult. Key challenges include high transmission line losses and bulky electrical packaging. Here, we demonstrate a wireless and wideband electro-optic modulation architecture that directly interfaces wireless mmWave signals with optical ones, eliminating the need for impedance-matched mmWave probes and cables.

These pulses often arise from the formation of dissipative solitons, which emerge due to a balance between energy excitation and dissipation. Harnessing the concept of parity-time (PT) symmetry to control this balance, we demonstrate a new type of laser dissipative solitons hosted in linearly coupled ring cavities. Our experiments are performed in a laser where the linear hybridized modes are in the PT-symmetric phase. We experimentally observe the formation of short pulses, stabilized by the selective breaking of the PT-symmetry by the Kerr nonlinearity. Our results unlock new possibilities for passive mode-locking by showing spontaneous pulse formation in PT-symmetric lasers without the need for additional intricate components such as saturable absorber or non-reciprocal and polarisation sensitive elements.

    "abstract": "           Directional and spectral control of thermal emission is essential for applications in energy conversion, imaging, and sensing. Existing planar, lithography-free epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) films only support transverse-magnetic (TM) control of thermal emission via the Berreman mode and cannot address transverse-electric (TE) waves due to the absence of natural optical magnetism over optical and infrared wavelengths Here, we introduce a hyperbolic metamaterial comprising alternating layers of degenerately-doped and intrinsic InAs that exhibits an epsilon-and-mu-near-zero (EMNZ) response, enabling dual-polarized, directionally and spectrally selective thermal emission. We first theoretically demonstrate that a mu-near-zero (MNZ) film on a perfect magnetic conductor supports a magnetic Berreman mode, absorbing TE-polarized radiation in analogy to the conventional Berreman mode supported in TM polarization. Using genetic and gradient-descent optimization, we design a dual-polarized emitter with independently tunable spectral peaks and emission angles. Parameter retrieval via homogenization confirms simultaneous EMNZ points at the target wavelengths and angles. Finally, experimental measurement of a sample fabricated via molecular beam epitaxy exhibits high absorptivity peaks for both polarizations in close agreement with simulations. This work realizes lithography-free, dual-polarized, spectrally and directionally selective emitters, offering a versatile platform for advanced infrared thermal management and device integration.

We considered two arrangements for the photodiodes: one in which they point upward into the mirror, and one in which they point outward, perpendicular to the mirror. To determine which design offers a better field of view on the plane, as well as detection of distance and orientation between two agents, we developed a test rail with three degrees of freedom to experimentally and systematically measure the signal registered by the photodiodes of a given sensor (in a single readout) from the light emitted by another as functions of the distance and orientation. Afterwards, we processed and analyzed the experimental data to develop mathematical models for the mean response of a photodiode in each design. Finally, by numerically inverting the models, we compared the two designs in terms of their accuracy. Our results show that the design with the photodiodes pointing upward resolves better the distance, while the other resolves better the orientation of the emitting agent, both providing an omnidirectional field of view.

    "abstract": "           High 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices is a critical parameter to keep under control in the design of complex circuits for low temperatures applications. Current models predict the 1/f noise to scale linearly with temperature, and gate oxide defects are expected to freeze out at cryogenic temperatures. Nevertheless, it has been repeatedly observed that 1/f noise deviates from the predicted behaviour and that gate oxide defects are still active around 4.2 K, producing random telegraph noise. In this paper, we probe single gate oxide defects in 2500 nMOS devices down to 5 K in order to investigate the origin of 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices. From our results, it is clear that the number of defects active at cryogenic temperatures resulting in random telegraph noise is larger than at 300 K. Threshold voltage shifts due to charged defects are shown to be exponentially distributed, with different modalities across temperatures and biases: from monomodal at 300 K to trimodal below 100 K. The third mode is interpreted in the framework of percolation theory. By fitting these distributions, it is shown that more than 80% of the detected defects belongs to the oxide bulk. Afterwards, starting from the raw data in time domain, we reconstruct the low frequency noise spectra, highlighting the contributions of defects belonging to different branches and, therefore, to different oxide layers. This analysis shows that, although interface traps and large defects associated with the third mode are the main sources of 1/f noise at 5 K, bulk oxide defects still contribute significantly to low-frequency noise at cryogenic temperatures. Finally, we show that defect time constants and step heights are uncorrelated, proving that elastic tunnelling model for charge trapping is not accurate.         ",

We identify asymptotic behaviors for high and low current densities, quantify the conditions under which ripening dominates, and derive analytical expressions for nucleus size, density, and surface coverage. Model predictions show excellent agreement with experimental data across multiple datasets. The results reveal how SEI and electrolyte conductivity, current density and metal-electrode contact angle govern deposition morphology and Coulombic efficiency.

In this context, we review fundamental bounds arising in Bayesian estimation theory, which serve as a benchmark throughout this work. We investigate the trade-off between entanglement-enhanced sensitivity and robustness against laser noise in order to identify optimal initial states, measurement schemes and estimation strategies. Beside standard protocols based on coherent spin states, squeezed spin states and GHZ states, we consider variational Ramsey protocols implemented via low-depth quantum circuits based on one-axis twisting operations to approach optimal stability. In particular, we review known and identify new optimal interrogation schemes for a variety of scenarios, including different experimental platforms, ensemble sizes and regimes characterized by a wide range of interrogation durations and dead times. Hence, this work establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework for optimizing Ramsey interrogation schemes, providing guidance for the development of next-generation optical atomic clocks.

A fundamental limitation on clock precision is the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), which stems from the uncorrelated projection noise of each atom. State-of-the-art optical lattice clocks interrogate large ensembles to minimize the SQL, but density-dependent frequency shifts pose challenges to scaling the atom number. The SQL can be surpassed, however, by leveraging entanglement, though it remains an open problem to achieve quantum advantage from spin squeezing at state-of-the-art stability levels. Here we demonstrate clock performance beyond the SQL, achieving a fractional frequency precision of 1.1 $\\times 10^{-18}$ for a single spin-squeezed clock. With cavity-based quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements, we prepare two spin-squeezed ensembles of $\\sim$30,000 strontium atoms confined in a two-dimensional optical lattice. A synchronous clock comparison with an interrogation time of 61 ms achieves a metrological improvement of 2.0(2) dB beyond the SQL, after correcting for state preparation and measurement errors. These results establish the most precise entanglement-enhanced clock to date and offer a powerful platform for exploring the interplay of gravity and quantum entanglement.         ",

    "abstract": "           Attosecond pulses of coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light are instrumental for investigating subatomic dynamics and can be produced using a free-electron laser (FEL). It has been suggested that an optical FEL, which employs a laser pulse in place of a conventional undulator, could enable a dramatically more compact implementation of such a light source. Yet, the high electron density and subsequent high emittance implied by an optical FEL makes this concept challenging to realize with an electron beam. There has been impressive progress in recent years producing collimated dense and relativistic beams of electrons and positrons in the laboratory. The inherent stability of a quasi-neutral electron-positron beam mitigates Coulomb expansion, and renders it a promising alternative source of coherent light, as we demonstrate here. Specifically, we show via computer simulations that broadband coherent light in the XUV domain, which takes the form of 8-as pulses at 92-as intervals, can be generated by microbunching of relativistic electrons and positrons in a laser pulse. This process occurs over a sub-millimeter length scale, enabling the development of orders-of-magnitude more compact light sources that could be employed in physics, chemistry, biology, and industry.

    "title": "Light trajectories and wave dynamics in optical wormholes",
    "abstract": "           We investigate the optical properties of a wormhole geometry characterized by a constant negative Gaussian curvature. This distinctive optical structure is modeled using the optical metric of the static BTZ black hole, corresponding to the hyperbolic wormhole framework. Within this model, we derive the arbitrary geodesics and the associated effective potential. Our analysis reveals that the effective potential becomes increasingly narrow as the curvature radius of the optical wormhole decreases, with all possible trajectories converging at the optical origin \\(\\rho = 0\\). We further analyze the wave modes governing light propagation on this curved surface, demonstrating that the effective potential is purely repulsive in both the small and large \\(\\rho\\) limits. While the potential remains finite in both regimes, its behavior differs markedly. Near the optical origin, the magnetic quantum number (\\(m\\)) exerts a significant influence on the effective repulsive potential, particularly for large values of \\(m\\), where the potential resembles a typical barrier. However, this effect diminishes with increasing optical distance. Using this framework, we compute the reflection and transmission coefficients for \\(m \\neq 0\\). Our findings indicate that the optical properties of the background are predominantly governed by the curvature radius of the optical wormhole, highlighting its critical role in shaping light propagation in such geometries.
