Previous studies accounted or diffraction loss by modeling it as a reduction in laser power for sensitivity calculations. In this research, we take an optical approach by explicitly considering the impact of vacuum fields introduced through diffraction loss, including leakage loss and higher-order mode loss, as well as mirror optical loss. By formulating input-output relations that incorporate these vacuum fields in a realistic cavity with diffraction loss and an optical spring, we achieve a more precise evaluation of DECIGO's optical response. This analysis provides new insights into how diffraction loss affects quantum-locking techniques, offering a refined framework for improving DECIGO's optical design and sensitivity estimation.

    "abstract": "           Interfacing electrical and optical systems is a ubiquitous requirement for modern networks. Competitive footprint, efficiency, and bandwidth figures have propelled interest in deploying integrated electro-optic modulators based on Pockels materials for such tasks. Due to its wide usage in legacy bulk electro-optic modulators, and triggered by the availability of 'on insulator' wafers, lithium niobate based devices have seen major advances. Recently, even more favorable properties have been demonstrated in lithium tantalate based devices, featuring similar Pockels effect, but exhibiting lower bias drift and lower birefringence, while equally benefiting from existing volume usage in wireless RF filters. Despite major progress in integrated modulators, these newly emerged ferro-electrical modulators cannot be integrated tightly with electronics yet using standardized processes, such as flip-chip bonding. Here, we overcome this bottleneck by incorporating the copper Damascene process in the fabrication of integrated lithium tantalate modulators. We demonstrate modulators featuring microwave losses that are ~10% lower than in designs relying on conventional gold electrodes. Our results allow us to reach data transmission figures on par with those of electro-optic modulators fabricated with other low-resistivity, yet less common, metals. Specifically, our fabricated modulators are able to achieve data transmission rates of 416 and 540 Gbit/s while preserving bit error ratios below the 25% SD-FEC threshold in a PAM4 and PAM8 transmission schemes, respectively. Together with the commercial availability of lithium tantalate as a Pockels material, our results open a path towards scalable and direct chip-on-wafer embedding of EO modulators with micro-electronic integrated circuits.

We show that CDP recovery can be reformulated exactly as the minimisation of a continuous-variable XY Hamiltonian and solved by gain-based photonic networks. The coupled-mode equations we exploit are the natural mean-field dynamics of exciton-polariton condensate lattices, coupled-laser arrays and driven photon Bose-Einstein condensates, while other hardware such as the spatial photonic Ising machine can implement the same update rule through high-speed digital feedback, preserving full optical parallelism. Numerical experiments on images, two- and three-dimensional vortices and unstructured complex data demonstrate that the gain-based solver consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Relaxed-Reflect-Reflect (RRR) algorithm in the medium-noise regime (signal-to-noise ratios 10--40 dB) and retains this advantage as problem size scales. Because the physical platform performs the continuous optimisation, our approach promises fast, energy-efficient phase retrieval on readily available photonic hardware. uch as two- and three-dimensional vortices, and unstructured random data.

    "abstract": "           Optical chirality density is a measure of the local handedness of electromagnetic fields. Like energy density, it may be absorbed or scattered through the interaction between light and matter. Here, we utilize the conservation of optical chirality to connect the parity and time-reversal symmetries of the intrinsic excitational eigenmodes of a material to those of their associated electromagnetic eigenfields as dictated by Maxwell's equations. To make this connection explicit, we theoretically examine the Born-Kuhn (BK) system, composed of a pair of plasmonic nanorods of variable separation, as a prototypical material model that is both geometrically chiral in its static structure and truly excitationally chiral in its eigenexcitations and eigenfields. By relaying optical chirality metrics of the BK eigenfields back to their underlying sourcing material degrees of freedom, we derive a unique mechanical chirality measure that is related to, but distinct from, other pseudoscalar metrics recently discussed in the literature. Beyond analysis in the absence of sources, we further derive optical chiral extinction, scattering, and absorption cross sections under external drive and discuss their rigorous connection to more common circular dichroism measurements as well as their limitations in comparison to eigenfield chirality metrics. Lastly, we investigate the conversion of achiral linearly polarized light into chiral elliptically polarized light through interaction with the BK system, illustrating the conservation of optical chirality in the interaction between light and matter through an analytically tractable example.

    "abstract": "           Dielectric metasurfaces are structured thin films with thickness smaller than the wavelength that aim at replacing and enhancing conventional bulk optical components by structuring local resonances across an aperture. At visible and near-infrared frequencies, titania or silicon are routinely used as substrates to realize these ultrathin devices, ideally suited for conventional nanofabrication techniques. Unfortunately, directly scaling these design and material approaches to long-wave infrared frequencies is not practical, due to challenges in the required thicknesses and the presence of phonon absorption lines. Nonlocal metasurfaces based on extended resonances with a local geometric phase offer a compelling design platform that can address these challenges. They enable ultrathin metasurfaces, as they leverage lattice resonances, while they also offer multi-functionalities and frequency-selectivity, and they can be implemented in a range of low-loss material platforms. Here, we demonstrate nonlocal metalenses based on germanium thin films on a zinc-selenide substrate, operating around 10.3{\\mu}m within a deeply subwavelength device thickness of 1.45{\\mu}m (14% the free-space wavelength). We showcase a novel meta-unit geometry based on a square lattice with highly isotropic dispersion features, supporting a resonant geometric phase that is highly stable in frequency, simplifying the rational design of complex metasurface operations. The introduced platform promises highly multi-functional, low-profile meta-optics with enhanced meta-unit designs, compatible with the challenging thermal spectral region for imaging and sensing applications.

In response to climate change and the need to reduce carbon footprints, there is a growing demand for NDI solutions that are primarily non-contact, as well as non-destructive, fast, and easily integrated. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a well-known diagnostic technique in medical and biological research, is increasingly being used for industrial NDI. In the mid-infrared (MIR) wavelength range, OCT can be used to characterise parts and defects not possible by other industry-ready scanners, and enables better penetration than conventional near-infrared OCT. In this article, we demonstrate NDI of wind turbine blade (WTB) coatings using an MIR OCT scanner employing light around 4 $\\mu$m from a supercontinuum source. We inspected the top two layers of the coating (topcoat and primer) in two different samples. The first is to determine the maximum penetration depth, and the second one is to emulate defect identification. The results of our study confirm that MIR OCT scanners are highly suitable for coating inspection and quality control in the production of WTBs, with performance parameters not achievable by other technologies.

The GB-beam was generated using a diffractive axicon lens and 10x demagnification optics. It was found that modification of b-Si well below (a factor 50x) the single pulse ablation fluence of 0.2 J/cm2 was possible, corresponding to ablation/melting of nano-needles. The width of modification was almost independent of pulse energy/fluence and had a width of 1/e2-intensity profile at the melting regime. For the GB-beam, the smallest width of laser modification at 0.2 J/cm2 threshold (at the center core) was close to the FWHM of the core of the GB-beam. The aspect ratio of the ablated groove on the surface of b-Si made by GB-beam was twice as large - up to 8 - compared to that achievable with G-beam, and it was at a lower fluence of 4 J/cm2 (50x reduction). Reflectivity of two-side nanotextured b-Si on plasma-thinned 70-micrometers thick Si was strongly reduced in the near-IR range, reaching transmittance >95% at 1.7-2.1 micrometres wavelengths.

    "abstract": "           Although most prior research on the dew-harvesting technology has focused on nocturnal operations, achieving round-the-clock freshwater harvesting remains crucial. However, daytime dew-harvesting faces two key challenges as compared to its nighttime counterpart: the high solar irradiance and the large contrast between the ambient temperature and the dewpoint. To address these challenges and guide the photonic design, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze dew-harvesting in a 24-h day-night cycle. Using Nanjing as an example, our analyses reveal that, in the solar regime, a minimum average solar reflectivity of 0.92 is required; in the infrared regime, a 10% reduction in absorptivity outside the 8-13 um transparency window is equivalent to a 5.9% enhancement in emissivity within the window. Guided by these findings, we propose a photonic design, which, in a synthetic experiment with measured meteorological datasets, achieves a water production rate of 313 g/m2-day, in which nearly 40% is contributed by daytime. This performance reaches approximately 70% of the theoretical maximum predicted using the ideal spectrum. We end by optimizing the layout of condensers in practical applications.         ",

However, the image resolution observed was not satisfactory. In this report, to improve the image quality, the parameters such as coincidence window was optimized to distinguish photon statistics effectively due to change in polarization angle and the objective lens was utilized to focus the entangled photon beams. These modifications enabled optical imaging by accurately detecting slight polarization variations in different media.

In particular, quantum computers have emerged as a promising technology with the potential to address these problems more efficiently in the coming decades, whether through reductions in memory, time, and energy consumption, $\\textit{i. e.}$, reductions in computational complexity or by enhancing precision.

In this work, we present the application of quantum mechanics to the study of molecules, provide an introduction to the fundamentals of quantum computing, and explore the integration of these fields by employing the VQE in molecular simulations.

We specify numbers and expected performance for the GBAR experiment, which aims at measuring the free-fall acceleration of antihydrogen at CERN antimatter facilities, and show that this approach improves the expected accuracy of the measurement.

We show that if the frequency of the pumping wave is close to polariton transitions in the hybrid system, non monotone dependence of fluorescence and scattering amplitudes on pump intensity with a narrow resonance-like response occurs. We demonstrate that this phenomenon occurs due to hybridization of lower and upper polaritons with substantially different excitation numbers caused by the pumping affecting polariton states of the system. This occurs when the Rabi interaction with coherent field is comparable to the field-matter coupling constant which in turn needs to be sufficient for the manifestation of strong coupling. This non-monotonic dependence of the fluorescence and scattering amplitudes on pump rate intensity pave the way for creation of nonlinear optical devices.         ",

Previous studies have focused mainly on periodic arrangements of the optical tweezers, which host various spatially ordered magnetic phases. Here, we perform unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the ground state of quantum Ising models for amorphous arrays of Rydberg atoms. These models are designed to feature well-controlled local structural properties in the absence of long-range order. Notably, by determining the Edwards-Anderson order parameter, we find evidence of a quantum phase transition from a paramagnetic to a spin-glass phase. The magnetic structure factor indicates short-range isotropic antiferromagnetic correlations. For the feasible sizes, the spin-overlap distribution features a nontrivial structure with two broad peaks and a sizable weight at zero overlap. The comparison against results for the clean kagome lattice, which features local structural properties similar to those of our amorphous arrays, highlights the important role of the absence of long-range structural order of the underlying array.

This work presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart, Vivianene, focusing on its structural, electronic, and optical properties. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we evaluate its thermodynamic stability, band structure, density of states, and optical response. Our results confirm that Vivianene retains the main structural features of bulk Vivianite while exhibiting enhanced thermodynamic stability at room temperature. The electronic structure analysis reveals an indirect bandgap of 3.03 eV for Vivianene, which is slightly lower than the 3.21 eV observed for bulk Vivianite, deviating from the expected quantum confinement trend in 2D materials. The projected density of states (PDOS) analysis indicates that Fe d orbitals predominantly contribute to the valence and conduction bands. Optical calculations demonstrate that Vivianene exhibits a higher optical band gap (3.6 eV) than bulk Vivianite (3.2 eV), with significant absorption in the ultraviolet region. The refractive index and reflectivity analyses suggest that most of the incident light is absorbed rather than reflected, reinforcing its potential for optoelectronic applications. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental properties of Vivianene and highlight its potential for advanced applications in sensing, optoelectronics, and energy-related technologies.

We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation where the external field plays an explicit role. Using these results, we provide an illustration of their usefulness and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies.

Consequently, in the presence of the resonant channel, the acquired polarization can be clearly observed even for light ions when it is challenging to discern which state of the ion was excited in the process. We also show that the energy dependence of the polarization parameter clearly demonstrates strong interference both between the contributions of specific autoionizing states in the resonant channel and between the non-resonant and resonant channels.

In this work, we perform numerical analysis to show that QSCI methods face critical limitations that severely hinder their practical applicability in chemistry. Using the nitrogen molecule and the iron-sulfur cluster [2Fe-2S] as examples, we demonstrate that while QSCI can, in principle, yield high-quality CI expansions similar to classical SCI heuristics in some cases, the method struggles with inefficiencies in finding new determinants as sampling repeatedly selects already seen configurations. This inefficiency becomes especially pronounced when targeting high-accuracy results or sampling from an approximate ansatz. In cases where the sampling problem is not present, the resulting CI expansions are less compact than those generated from classical heuristics, rendering QSCI an overall more expensive method. Our findings suggest a significant drawback in QSCI methods when sampling from the ground-state distribution as the inescapable trade-off between finding sufficiently many determinants and generating compact, accurate CI expansions. This ultimately hinders utility in quantum chemistry applications, as QSCI falls behind more efficient classical counterparts.         ",

    "abstract": "           A major limitation of laser interferometers using continuous wave lasers are parasitic light fields, such as ghost beams, scattered or stray light, which can cause non-linear noise. This is especially relevant for laser interferometric ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Increasing their sensitivity, particularly at frequencies below 10 Hz, is threatened by the influence of parasitic photons. These can up-convert low-frequency disturbances into phase and amplitude noise inside the relevant measurement band. By artificially tuning the coherence of the lasers, using pseudo-random-noise (PRN) phase modulations, this influence of parasitic fields can be suppressed. As it relies on these fields traveling different paths, it does not sacrifice the coherence for the intentional interference. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique experimentally, achieving noise suppression levels of 40 dB in a Michelson interferometer with an artificial coherence length below 30 cm. We probe how the suppression depends on the delay mismatch and length of the PRN sequence. We also prove that optical resonators can be operated in the presence of PRN modulation by measuring the behavior of a linear cavity with and without such a modulation. By matching the resonators round-trip length and the PRN sequence repetition length, the classic response is recovered.         ",

    "abstract": "           We propose a novel modular debiasing technique applicable to any discrete random source, addressing the fundamental challenge of reliably extracting high-quality randomness from inherently imperfect physical processes. The method involves summing the outcomes of multiple independent trials from a biased source and reducing the sum modulo the number of possible outcomes, $m$. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework, utilizing probability generating functions and roots of unity, demonstrating that this simple operation guarantees the exponential convergence of the output distribution to the ideal uniform distribution over $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$. A key theoretical result is the method's remarkable robustness: convergence is proven for any initial bias (provided all outcomes have non-zero probability) and, crucially, is maintained even under non-stationary conditions or time-dependent noise, which are common in physical systems. Analytical bounds quantify this exponential rate of convergence, and are empirically validated by numerical simulations. This technique's simplicity, strong theoretical guarantees, robustness, and data efficiency make it particularly well-suited for practical implementation in quantum settings, such as spatial photon-detection-based Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs), offering an efficient method for extracting high-quality randomness resilient to experimental imperfections.

Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.         ",

We illustrate the combined formalism on a prototypical two-band semiconductor model with long-range density-density Coulomb interactions. We show that the intraband thermalization of conduction band electrons induces nontrivial time-dependent changes in the system's bandstructure and a time-evolving band-gap renormalization (with a reduction by up to 10\\%). We show that the qualitative features are preserved for a variety of parameters, discuss the corresponding spectral dynamics, and provide an outlook on the newly introduced simulation framework, which enables treating electron-electron scattering and dissipation effects on equal footing.
