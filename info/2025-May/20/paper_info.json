    "title": "The Journey from Planck Distribution to Bose Statistics From Classical to Quantum Mechanics and Beyond",
    "abstract": "           In 1924, Satyendra Nath Bose's pioneering work laid the foundation for Bose-Einstein statistics, which describes particles with integral spins. His derivation of Planck's law for blackbody radiation bypassed classical assumptions, relying instead on the statistical mechanics of light quanta. Bose's methodology addressed limitations in existing theories, such as Einstein's dependence on classical concepts like Wien's displacement law and Bohr's correspondence principle. Further, his work underscored the incompatibility between classical electrodynamics and quantum theory, proposing innovative statistical approaches to thermodynamic equilibrium. The insights from Bose's work extend beyond theoretical physics. As was immediately noticed by Einstein, for temperatures below a critical threshold, Bose-Einstein statistics predicts the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where particles condense en-masse into the ground state. This quantum phenomenon on a macroscopic scale opened avenues to explore new technologies in recent times, apart from throwing light on new phases of matter. This article revisits Bose's groundbreaking contributions, highlighting their enduring impact on quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and field theory.         ",

    "abstract": "           In previous papers, we demonstrated that an ontology of quantum mechanics, described in terms of states and events with internal phenomenal aspects (a form of panprotopsychism), is well suited to explain consciousness. We showed that the combination problems of qualities, structures and subjects in panpsychism and panprotopsychism stem from implicit hypotheses based on classical physics regarding supervenience, which are not applicable at the quantum level. Within this view, consciousness arises in entangled quantum systems coupled to the neural network of the brain. In entangled systems, the properties of individual parts disappear, giving rise to an exponential number of emergent properties and states. Here, we analyze self-consciousness as the capacity to view oneself as a subject of experience. The causal openness of quantum systems provides self-conscious beings the ability to make independent choices and decisions, reflecting a sense of self-governance and autonomy. In this context, the issue of personal identity takes a new form free from the problems of the simple view or the reductive approaches.         ",

However, producing scalable photonic artificial intelligence (AI) solutions remains challenging. To make photonic AI models viable, the scalability problem needs to be solved. Large optical AI models implemented on PNNs are only commercially feasible if the advantages of optical computation outweigh the cost of their input-output overhead. In this Perspective, we discuss how field-programmable metasurface technology may become a key hardware ingredient in achieving scalable photonic AI accelerators and how it can compete with current digital electronic technologies. Programmability or reconfigurability is a pivotal component for PNN hardware, enabling in situ training and accommodating non-stationary use cases that require fine-tuning or transfer learning. Co-integration with electronics, 3D stacking, and large-scale manufacturing of metasurfaces would significantly improve PNN scalability and functionalities. Programmable metasurfaces could address some of the current challenges that PNNs face and enable next-generation photonic AI technology.         ",

The KdV$\\theta$ equation is used to analytically describe the intermediate 2D asymptotics of line solitons subject to sufficiently long transverse perturbations of arbitrary strength, while cKdV equation is used to describe outward and inward propagating ring waves with localised and periodic perturbations. Both models are used to describe the evolution of hybrid waves, where we show, in particular, that large lumps can appear as transient states in the evolution of such curved waves, contributing to the possible mechanisms of generation of rogue waves.

    "abstract": "           Surface scattering and grain boundary scattering are two prominent mechanisms dictating the conductivity of interconnects and are traditionally modeled using the Fuchs-Sondheimer (FS) and Mayadas-Shatzkes (MS) theories, respectively. In addition to these approaches, modern interconnect structures need to capture the space-dependence of conductivity, for which a spatially resolved FS (SRFS) model was previously proposed to account for surface scattering based on Boltzmann transport equations (BTE). In this paper, we build upon the SRFS model to integrate grain-boundary scattering leading to a physics-based SRFS-MS model for the conductivity of rectangular interconnects. The effect of surface and grain scattering in our model is not merely added (as in several previous works) but is appropriately integrated following the original MS theory. Hence, the SRFS-MS model accounts for the interplay between surface scattering and grain boundary scattering in dictating the spatial dependence of conductivity. We also incorporate temperature (T) dependence into the SRFS-MS model. Further, we propose a circuit compatible conductivity model (SRFS-MS-C3), which captures the space-dependence and integration of surface and grain boundary scattering utilizing an analytical function and a few (three or four) invocations of the physical SRFS-MS model. We validate the SRFS-MS-C3 model across a wide range of physical parameters, demonstrating excellent agreement with the physical SRFS-MS model, with an error margin of less than 0.7%. The proposed SRFS-MS and SRFS-MS-C3 models explicitly relate the spatially resolved conductivity to physical parameters such as electron mean free path ({\\lambda}0), specularity of surface scattering (p), grain boundary reflectance coefficient (R), interconnect cross-section geometry and temperature (T).

While efforts have been made to promote the detection accuracy of optical frequencies, retrieval on optical waveforms remains on the autocorrelation scheme with limited performances. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme for optical metrology, particularly on direct retrieval of optical waveform in terms of the field amplitude profile. The scheme is based on massive four-wave-mixings underlying a nanophotonic supercontinuum process, which enables arbitrary transfer of an additive laser to modulational sidebands of the broadened continuum. Detection of the transferred signals is then flexible to be within the whole span of the supercontinuum from visible to the mid-infrared range. We demonstrate such a transfer scheme for both CW lasers and pulsed lasers. For the latter, the temporal amplitude profile of the optical wave can be retrieved, which reveals high-order dynamics of solitary pulses including the self-steepening, self-compression, and the soliton splitting, and shows a remarkable square-fold increase of signal-to-noise ratio in the power spectrum. Our results may contribute to advance optical metrology particularly towards chip scale optical waveform detection, and more fundamentally, they reveal insights of massive ultrafast nonlinear interactions underlying the soliton-based supercontinuum process.

We observe coherent harmonic generation up to the 12th harmonic of the seed and achieve saturation of the 7th harmonic in the radiator.

However, achieving such SCG in nanophotonic platforms is challenging due to the difficulties in spectrum broadening. Here, Such ultrabroad-bandwidth SCG was demonstrated in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) nanophotonic waveguides by dispersion management, without periodic poling for spectral broadening. Anomalous-dispersion waveguides were designed in the telecom band, simultaneously enabling dispersive wave emergence, modal-matched second harmonic generation, and third harmonic generation for spectrum broadening. Moreover, MgO was intentionally doped to mitigate the photorefractive effect of lithium niobate, which frequently results in un-sustained spectrum broadening and in turn limits the accessible SCG coverage. By leveraging photolithography assisted chemo-mechanical etching, low-loss MgO doped TFLN nanophotonic waveguides were fabricated. As a result, thanks to the utilization of the strong second-order and third-order nonlinear processes, gap-free 2.7-octave SCG spanning from 330 nm to 2250 nm was observed by pumping the waveguide with a 1550-nm femtosecond pulsed laser with 0.687 nJ, agreeing well with numerical simulation.

A terahertz (THz) frequency comb is a key asset for THz technology applications in spectroscopy, metrology, communications, and sensing. However, the THz frequency comb technologies are comparatively underdeveloped compared to the optical frequency domain, primarily attributed to the deficiency of advanced THz generation components. In this paper, we innovatively demonstrate a compact THz frequency comb source based on a resonant tunneling diode (RTD) through active mode locking technique. By injecting a strong continuous-wave radio frequency (RF) signal via the bias line into a RTD oscillator integrated within a WR-5 hollow metallic waveguide package, we observe a broadband comb spectrum spanning from 140 to 325 GHz. The mode spacing is directly determined by the frequency of the injected RF signal, providing a wide tuning range of approximately 40 GHz. We also employ the proposed frequency comb source as the local oscillator in a coherent transmitter. In particular, this is the first all-electrical compact THz frequency comb source, and the transmission demonstration paves the way to next-generation communication.         ",

Here, we report a fundamentally different paradigm: dissipative quadratic soliton (DQS) mode-locking in a continuous-wave (CW)-pumped, doubly resonant second-harmonic generation cavity. By leveraging a cascaded quadratic nonlinear process, we realize an effective Kerr nonlinearity (EKN) that exceeds the intrinsic material Kerr response by over three orders of magnitude and is tunable in both magnitude and sign via pump detuning. This engineered nonlinearity enables femtosecond DQS formation in a free-space lithium niobate cavity with normal dispersion, without dispersion engineering or synchronization electronics. Numerical simulations predict distinct dynamical regimes depending on phase detuning, and experiments confirm the spontaneous emergence of bichromatic femtosecond solitons spanning visible and near-infrared wavelengths. The observed DQSs exhibit spectral 3 dB bandwidths and transform-limited pulse durations of 1.15 THz and 274 fs for the pump and 1.13 THz and 279 fs for the second harmonic.

Despite their advantages in radiation tolerance, 3D pixel sensors exhibit non-uniform electric and weighting fields that can degrade timing performance. This study explores the impact of pixel cell geometry on the timing characteristics of 3D columnar-electrode sensors fabricated by IMB-CNM, comparing square and hexagonal layouts. The sensors were characterized using the Two-Photon Absorption Transient Current Technique (TPA-TCT), providing high-resolution three-dimensional maps of the Time-of-Arrival (ToA) of charge carriers. Measurements at multiple depths and bias voltages reveal that the square geometry yields a more uniform temporal response compared to the hexagonal configuration. Additionally, a novel TPA-TCT-based method was introduced to determine the sensor jitter, relying on the analysis of the time difference between consecutive pulses in the TPA-TCT pulse train acquired under identical conditions. These findings underline the importance of pixel design optimization for future 4D-tracking detectors and confirm the TPA-TCT method as a powerful tool for detailed timing characterization.

    "abstract": "           Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a powerful platform for integrated nonlinear and quantum photonics, owing to its strong optical nonlinearities, wide transparency window, and electro- and piezo-optic properties. However, conventional traveling-wave resonators, such as micro-rings, disks, and racetracks, suffer from curvature-dependent group dispersion and losses, limited spectral tunability, and parasitic nonlinearities, which constrain their performance, scalability, and operational stability in nonlinear photonic circuits. Here, we present photonic crystal (PhC) Fabry-Perot (FP) micro-resonators in TFLN that address these limitations. The device features a one-dimensional straight cavity bounded by PhC reflectors and supports well-confined standing-wave resonant modes within an engineered photonic bandgap. We achieve intrinsic quality (Q) factors of up to 1.4e6 and demonstrate that both the free spectral range (FSR) and coupling strength can be consistently controlled via cavity length and PhC coupler design, respectively. The photonic bandgap is tunable across the S-, C-, and L-bands without degradation of resonator performance. Spectral confinement of high-Q resonant modes is expected to mitigate parasitic nonlinearities, such as Raman scattering. These advances, together with the one-dimensional geometry, establish PhC FP micro-resonators as compact and scalable building blocks for high-density photonic integrated circuits targeting next-generation nonlinear and quantum applications.

Based on the obtained criteria for the formation of an inverse EDF in a non-uniform plasma, studies are conducted in low- and medium-pressure glow discharges with flat and hollow cathodes. The results of the numerical modeling and theoretical analysis are used to present reliable criteria and scaling for the evaluation of the possible inversion of the EDF under specific conditions. By solving the nonlocal Boltzmann kinetic equation in energy and coordinate variables, it is shown that the simplest way to implement the inversion of the EDF is in a glow discharge with a hollow cathode. For such discharges, practical recommendations are developed and specific conditions for the experimental detection of an inverse EDF are identified.         ",

    "abstract": "           Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) pumped by femtosecond lasers offer an increasingly popular approach to generate broadband terahertz radiation. The strength of the emitted terahertz field is limited in part by the STEs optical damage threshold at the pump wavelength. Their thermal management can be improved by better understanding the electron temperature relaxation in the spintronic metal layer. Here we present a measurement of the electron temperature dynamics on a picosecond timescale using optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy. We observe that the optical pump induces a change in the terahertz transmissivity of the STE. This approach has an advantage over other methods, because it avoids the possibility of further heating of the sample by the probe pulse. This is especially significant for measurements of accumulative heat effects, which can dominate the optical damage mechanism when the STE is pumped at a MHz repetition rate.         ",

    "abstract": "           High-precision positioning in GPS-denied environments is a demanding but challenging technology. Resonant Beam Positioning (RBP) utilizes a resonant beam with properties such as energy focusing, self-establishment, self-alignment, and passive operation, offering a promising solution for this task. However, traditional RBP algorithms require a fixed number of resonant beam base stations, which can be costly to expand to increase coverage. To address this limitation, we propose a distributed resonant beam positioning (DRBP) system that simultaneously estimates the base station and mobile target (MT) positions. The MT receives resonant beam samples to locate the base station in this system. Subsequently, it estimates self-position based on the known locations of the base stations. The DRBP system facilitates self-positioning on the MT side, enabling dynamic expansion of both the number of base stations and the coverage area. Numerical results demonstrate that DRBP achieves a positioning root mean square error (RMSE) of $0.1$ m and a rotation RMSE of 2$^\\circ$, validating the system's high accuracy.         ",

In this review, we highlight recent advances in multireference density matrix embedding and localized active space self-consistent field approaches for complex molecules and extended materials. We discuss both classical implementations and the emerging potential of these methods on quantum computers.

Semiempirical models occupied a large share of this market in its early days, but the research activity in atomistic simulation has steadily polarized over the last three decades towards general-purpose but expensive ab initio quantum mechanics methods and fast but special-purpose molecular mechanics methods. I offer perspective on recent trends in atomistic simulation from the middle ground of semiempirical modeling, to learn from its past success and consider its possible paths to future growth.

    "abstract": "           We present the results of the GIGAPYX-4600 image sensor in space environment, more specifically under different types of irradiations (protons and heavy ions). The GIGAPYX-4600 is a state-of-the-art 46M pixel multi-purpose, backside illuminated CMOS image sensor. The sensor features high-speed (200 fps), low-noise (< 2e-rms), rolling shutter readout. It has been fabricated using 65 nm node CMOS technology, making use of capacitive deep trench isolation, thus exhibiting good MTF as well as excellent dark current characteristics. The GIGAPYX image sensor family is meant to be easily scalable thanks to a novel use of stitching technology. The assessed sensor features an impressive 46 Mpixels, but the sensor family is meant to be scaled up to 220 M pixels. The idea of this study was to investigate the radiation hardness of a commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) image sensor that could be suitable for space-borne applications, such as earth observation or satellite vicinity surveillance. In the near future a radiation hard readout electronic for this sensor family will be made available off-the-shelf by Pyxalis. This presentation will overview the different sensor key performances evolutions after proton irradiation up to a total fluence of 2.3e11 p+/cm${}^2$ (62 MeV): dark current, dark current non-uniformity (DCNU), noise, non-linearity, saturation charge and photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU). As expected, degradations mostly occur on the dark current, DCNU and temporal noise. The orders of magnitude of the degradation are in the range of the already published high performance CIS technologies. Results obtained from heavy ions irradiations will demonstrate that the GIGAPYX is not only latch-up free at least up to 57 Mev.cm2/mg, but resistant to the blooming effects induced by a SET at pixel level thanks to its capacitive deep trench isolations. Various SEE effects have been studied, demonstrating encouraging results for such COTS device in order to fly, in particular in GEO orbit. All these radiations results will be used as inputs in designing space camera based on the GIGAPYX sensors, compatible with multiple-mission types.         ",

    "abstract": "           MZI-based block optical neural networks (BONNs), which can achieve large-scale network models, have increasingly drawn attentions. However, the robustness of the current training algorithm is not high enough. Moreover, large-scale BONNs usually contain numerous trainable parameters, resulting in expensive computation and power consumption. In this article, by pruning matrix blocks and directly optimizing the individuals in population, we propose an on-chip covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and attention-based pruning (CAP) algorithm for large-scale BONNs. The calculated results demonstrate that the CAP algorithm can prune 60% and 80% of the parameters for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively, while only degrades the performance by 3.289% and 4.693%. Considering the influence of dynamic noise in phase shifters, our proposed CAP algorithm (performance degradation of 22.327% for MNIST dataset and 24.019% for Fashion-MNIST dataset utilizing a poor fabricated chip and electrical control with a standard deviation of 0.5) exhibits strongest robustness compared with both our previously reported block adjoint training algorithm (43.963% and 41.074%) and the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (25.757% and 32.871%), respectively. Moreover, when 60% of the parameters are pruned, the CAP algorithm realizes 88.5% accuracy in experiment for the simplified MNIST dataset, which is similar to the simulation result without noise (92.1%). Additionally, we simulationally and experimentally demonstrate that using MZIs with only internal phase shifters to construct BONNs is an efficient way to reduce both the system area and the required trainable parameters. Notably, our proposed CAP algorithm show excellent potential for larger-scale network models and more complex tasks.         ",

    "abstract": "           Space-borne quantum technologies, particularly those based on atom interferometry, are heralding a new era of strategic and robust space exploration. The unique conditions of space, characterized by low noise and low gravity environments, open up diverse possibilities for applications ranging from precise time and frequency transfer to Earth Observation and the search of new Physics. In this paper, we summarise the M-class mission proposal in response to the 2022 call in ESA's science program: Space-Time Explorer and Quantum Equivalence Principle Space Test (STE-QUEST). It consists in a satellite mission featuring a dual-species atom interferometer operating over extended durations. This mission aims to tackle three of the most fundamental questions in Physics: (i) testing the universality of free fall with an accuracy better than one part in $10^{-17}$, (ii) exploring various forms of Ultra-Light Dark Matter, and (iii) scrutinizing the foundations of Quantum Mechanics.

    "abstract": "           Quantum diamond microscopy (QDM), which employs nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles, is a promising approach to quantitatively imaging magnetic fields with both high resolution that approaches the diffraction limit and a wide field of view. The commonly adopted setups of QDM capture the photoluminescence through transparent diamonds, which inevitably entail aberrations -- optical errors that degrade the optical resolution and contrast of the obtainable image. In this study, we delve into the impact of optical aberrations, focusing on their dependence on diamond thickness. We first introduce a rigorous model [Richards et al., Braat et al.] of diffraction that incorporates aberrations, producing the NV center optical image. We confirm that this model accurately reproduces the confocal images of single NV centers obtained at various depths in diamonds. Extending this model to a wide-field microscope, we find that the model also accurately reproduces the USAF 1951 resolution test chart obtained through diamonds of various thicknesses. Based on these investigations, we quantitatively assess the consequent resolution constraints and propose thinning the diamond as a viable solution. We present a robust method to quantitatively ascertain resolution in optical systems influenced by aberrations caused by ray transmission through diamonds. For instance, for a typical microscope with an objective lens of NA = 0.7, the diffraction limit is achievable through diamonds that are 30 $\\mu$m thick, and a resolution of 1 $\\mu$m is obtained through diamonds that are 100 $\\mu$m thick. Those results opens up avenues for enhanced performance in QDM. The Julia package used to calculate the vectorial PSFs is available at ${\\texttt this http URL}$.         ",

Recently, we employed logical reasoning to demonstrate that isotropic chiral media, a kind of optically active media, do not exhibit circular birefringence. This finding implies that the Jones vector is not able to completely describe the polarization state of a plane light wave. To further explore the reason, here we revisit the phenomenon of optical rotation in helically-coiled optical fibers. Firstly, we use similar logical reasoning to prove that helically coiled fibers do not exhibit circular birefringence, either. Secondly, based on the experimental observations of Papp and Harms, we argue that the Jones vector is mathematically an entity in the local reference frame associated with the propagation direction. It cannot completely describe the state of polarization relative to the laboratory reference frame. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate that the rotation observed by Papp and Harms reflects the rotation of the Tang frame relative to the Serret-Frenet frame.         ",

This is what we show in this paper, both theoretically and experimentally, in the case of beams with a doughnut-like intensity profile: one of them having a helical wavefront (vortex beam with orbital angular momentum) and the other with no orbital angular momentum at all (which we call pseudovortex beam). We write the mode decomposition of such beams in the Hermite-Gaussian basis and in the Laguerre-Gauss basis, respectively, and study how they interact with a triangular cavity in terms of their resonance peaks. The experimental results corroborate the theoretical predictions, demonstrating that each beam exhibits a distinct resonance pattern. This suggests that such a cavity can be used to identify beams carrying orbital angular momentum, effectively distinguishing them from pseudovortices. Moreover, we propose an experiment where three cavities may be used to filter out the pseudovortex from a superposition of vortex and pseudovortex.         ",

This has spurred significant interest in developing chiral cavities that feature broken TRS, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a design for high-quality-factor THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) that achieves broken TRS using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. We incorporate ab initio density functional theory calculations into the derived microscopic model, allowing a realistic estimate of the vacuum-induced gap in graphene when coupled to our chiral cavity. Our calculations show an enhancement in the light-matter interaction due to Dirac nodes and predict an energy gap on the order of 1 meV.

For standard optical cavities, each eigenmode corresponds to a single, well-defined frequency. Here, we present a macroscopic optical Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity whose eigenmodes are coherent superpositions of two frequency modes in the VIS-NIR range. Specifically, we demonstrate strong coupling between 384 THz (780 nm) and 580 THz (516 nm) cavity modes by incorporating an intracavity $\\chi^{(2)}$ crystal driven by a non-resonant optical pump at 1529 nm. Strong coupling enables us to demonstrate frequency conversion with an end-to-end, free-space conversion efficiency of 30(1)%, limited by current cavity design and internal cavity losses. We also demonstrate coupling between distinct spatial modes at the two frequencies, extending coherent control to the spatial basis. In conjunction with improved resonator design and low-loss nonlinear crystals, we anticipate a factor of $>$50 increase in two-mode-cooperativity for stronger coupling and near-unity conversion efficiency at low pump powers. This platform opens new avenues for cavity-QED experiments, with potential applications spanning cavity-mediated interactions between distinct atomic species, interconnects for quantum networking and modular computing, and spatially multimode cavity physics.

It is shown that at a sufficiently high IR-field intensity these combs correspond to a sequence of subfemtosecond beats of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation of a deterministic shape. At the same time, at a lower IR-field intensity ASE remains quasimonochromatic, but its frequency shifts as a result of the IR-field-induced quadratic Stark effect. In this case, the frequency tuning range of XUV radiation is approximately twice the frequency of the modulating IR field. In addition, modulation by the IR field leads to amplitude and frequency discrimination of the polarization components of ASE, parallel and orthogonal to the IR field. The possibility of observing these effects is analyzed for a collisional plasma x-ray laser based on neon-like Ti12+ ions with an unperturbed ASE wavelength of 32.6 nm and a modulating field with a wavelength of 1 {\\mu}m and an intensity in the range of 10^16 - 10^17 W/cm^2.

    "abstract": "           Ultra-high intensity laser-plasma interactions can produce ultra-relativistic electrons via direct laser acceleration, assisted by quasi-static plasma magnetic and electric fields. These fields transversely confine electron motion and induce betatron oscillations. The net energy gain is strongly influenced by the interplay between two frequencies: the betatron frequency and the frequency of laser field oscillations experienced by the electron. Prior work has shown that energy gain is enabled by a resonance between the betatron oscillations and the oscillations of the laser field. In particular, higher-order resonances occur when the laser field completes multiple cycles during one betatron oscillation, allowing additional regimes of energy transfer beyond the fundamental (betatron) resonance. In this work, we demonstrate that such resonances become particularly effective when the laser's phase velocity is superluminal. Although the two frequencies generally evolve differently with increasing electron energy, which leads to detuning, a superluminal phase velocity introduces a non-monotonic frequency ratio with a global minimum. This minimum allows sustained frequency matching over a broad energy range, thereby enabling enhanced energy gain. As the phase velocity increases, the betatron resonance becomes ineffective due to premature frequency detuning. At the same time, higher-order resonances become increasingly effective, emerging as the dominant mechanisms for enhanced energy gain in this regime of direct laser acceleration.         ",

A common assumption is that the landscape is rigid; however, in principle it can be altered by radiation pressure, a concept that has found fruitful application in the field of quantum optomechanics. Here we explore active imaging of a mechanical resonator with an eye to generalizing the concept of radiation pressure backaction to spatially multimode light. As a thought experiment, we consider imaging the flexural modes of a membrane by sorting the spatial modes of a laser reflected from its surface. We show that backaction in this setting arises from spatial photon shot noise, an effect that cannot be observed in single-mode optomechanics. We also derive the imprecision-backaction product for coherent illumination in the limit of purely spatial backaction, revealing it to be equivalent to the standard quantum limit for purely dispersive, single-mode optomechanical coupling. Finally, we show that optomechanical correlations due to spatial backaction can give rise to two-mode entangled light. In conjunction with high-$Q$ nanomechanics, our findings point to new opportunities at the interface of quantum imaging and optomechanics, including sensors and networks enhanced by spatial mode entanglement.

    "abstract": "           We show that iteration of a few ( $\\sim N^{1/4}$) unitary steps of Grover's algorithm suffices to perfectly prepare a Dicke state of $N$ atoms in a cavity. We also show that a few subsequent Grover steps can be employed to generate GHZ and Cat states. The Grover iteration is physically realized by global qubit rotations and by the phase shift of single photons reflected on the cavity. Our protocols are deterministic and require no individual addressing of the atoms. A detailed error analysis accounting for spatial mode matching of the photon to the cavity, spontaneous emission, mirror scattering, and the finite bandwidth of the photon mode is used to predict the fidelity of the prepared states as a function of system parameters and atom-cavity cooperativity. The fidelity can be increased by heralding on detection of the reflected photon.         ",

    "title": "Light trajectories and wave dynamics in optical wormholes",
    "abstract": "           We investigate the optical properties of a wormhole geometry characterized by a constant negative Gaussian curvature. This distinctive optical structure is modeled using the optical metric of the static BTZ black hole, corresponding to the hyperbolic wormhole framework. Within this model, we derive the arbitrary geodesics and the associated effective potential. Our analysis reveals that the effective potential becomes increasingly narrow as the curvature radius of the optical wormhole decreases, with all possible trajectories converging at the optical origin \\(\\rho = 0\\). We further analyze the wave modes governing light propagation on this curved surface, demonstrating that the effective potential is purely repulsive in both the small and large \\(\\rho\\) limits. While the potential remains finite in both regimes, its behavior differs markedly. Near the optical origin, the magnetic quantum number (\\(m\\)) exerts a significant influence on the effective repulsive potential, particularly for large values of \\(m\\), where the potential resembles a typical barrier. However, this effect diminishes with increasing optical distance. Using this framework, we compute the reflection and transmission coefficients for \\(m \\neq 0\\). Our findings indicate that the optical properties of the background are predominantly governed by the curvature radius of the optical wormhole, highlighting its critical role in shaping light propagation in such geometries.

    "abstract": "           We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\\mathsf{P}\\neq\\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of reference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and generalized unitary coupled-cluster with single and double excitations, for which computing the off-diagonal matrix elements is $\\mathsf{BQP}$-complete for any polynomial depth. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.         ",

    "abstract": "           Isotopically enriched silicon (Si) can greatly enhance qubit coherence times by minimizing naturally occurring $^{29}$Si which has a non-zero nuclear spin. Ultra-high fluence $^{28}$Si ion implantation of bulk natural Si substrates was recently demonstrated as an attractive technique to ultra-high $^{28}$Si isotopic purity. In this work, we apply this $^{28}$Si enrichment process to produce $^{28}$Si and $^{28}$Si-on-insulator (SOI) samples. Experimentally, we produced a $^{28}$Si sample on natural Si substrate with $^{29}$Si depleted to 7~ppm (limited by measurement noise floor), that is at least 100 nm thick. This is achieved with an ion energy that results in a sputter yield of less than one and an ultra-high ion fluence, as supported by our improved computational model that is based on fitting a large number of experiments. Further, our model predicts the $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si depletion in our sample to be less than 1~ppm. In the case of SOI, ion implantation conditions are found to be more stringent than those of bulk natural Si in terms of minimizing threading dislocations upon subsequent solid phase epitaxy annealing. Finally, we do not observe open volume defects in our $^{28}$SOI and $^{28}$Si samples after SPE annealing (620\u00b0C, 10 minutes).         ",
