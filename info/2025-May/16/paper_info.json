    "abstract": "           We present an analysis of the transmission spectra of the twisted bilayer photonic slabs using a modified rigorous coupled wave (RCWA) analysis, where the evanescent bases are replaced by bases with non-zero flux density. By utilizing the modified RCWA we demonstrate the calculation of eigenmodes, which has not been realized before. To counter for the transmission property, we propose a five-layer uniform slab approximation, with an accuracy around 0.04a/c, which is more straightforward and accessible for optical engineers compared to work by Lou et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 136101]. The moir\u00e9 pattern perturbation induces a split of resonance, which show great potential for engineering the band structure. Moreover, We observe two distinct transmission phases: the angle-dependent phase and Fabry-P\u00e9rot phase, which is explained by a coupled-mode theory (CMT) with expanded channels brought by the modified eigenmodes. Our work provides a theoretical framework for the design and optimization of twisted bilayer photonic devices.         ",

Accurate grading and staging, primarily based on histopathological examination of biopsy tissue samples, are crucial for treatment planning and predicting outcomes. However, this manual process is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability among pathologists. The increasing volume of digital histopathology slides necessitates the development of robust, automated methods to assist in this critical diagnostic step for ovarian cancer. (Methods) This study presents a deep learning framework for the automated prediction of ovarian cancer stage (classified into five categories: 0, I, II, III, IV) using routine histopathological images. We employed a transfer learning approach, fine-tuning a ResNet-101 convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet. The training process incorporated comprehensive data augmentation, weighted random sampling, and class weighting to address dataset characteristics. Hyperparameter optimization for learning rate, dropout rate, and weight decay was performed using a genetic algorithm to enhance model performance and generalization.

    "abstract": "           Integrated microwave photonic filters (IMPFs) have emerged as promising candidates for advanced microwave systems owing to their distinctive combination of wide operational bandwidth, reconfigurable functionality, and compact size. Nevertheless, the complex and time-consuming manual manipulation of IMPFs remains a significant impediment to their widespread applications. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we experimentally demonstrate the first intelligent configuration of IMPF featuring wideband center frequency tunability, flexible bandwidth reconfigurability, self-stabilization, and excellent channel equalization simultaneously. The configuration strategy is enabled by our proposed universal hybrid collaboration algorithm, which can fully unleash the hardware potential of the optical device, thus enabling comprehensive synergy of multiple properties. Results show that the center frequency of IMPF is tuned from 2 to 48 GHz, and the bandwidth is reconfigured from 0.66 to 4.15 GHz, with a rejection ratio of up to 37.67 dB. The roll-off rate and shape factor reach as high as 17.50 dB/GHz and 0.78, respectively. Meanwhile, the maximum center frequency drift of IMPF in 3 hours is reduced from 11.950 to 0.051 GHz even without a thermo-electric cooler, indicating that the center frequency stability is enhanced by 234 times. The passband shape of the IMPF can also be dynamically adjusted to equalize frequency-dependent fading, achieving up to 2.42 dB compensation of intra-channel fading. Our work highlights the potential of IMPFs based on intelligent configuration, unlocking new avenues for practical applications of microwave photonic signal processing.         ",

While the requirement for optimised coverage within the tracking detector necessitates a slim sensor edge between active region and physical sensor edge, wider edge regions were found to be beneficial for the sensor performance during an early prototyping phase. In order to study the impact of differently sized edge regions, test structures were used to compare their individual active regions. Measurements of each diode were performed using a micro-focused X-ray beam to map its respective active area. This paper presents measurements of these test structures using AREA-X showing that the active area of a silicon particle tracking sensor does not only depend on the size of its bias ring, but also the size and configuration of its edge structure.

Such resonantly-destabilized KBMs are characterized by broad eigenfunctions along the magnetic field line and near-marginal positive growth rates, even well below the beta threshold of their non-resonant counterparts. This unconventional (or sub-threshold) KBM, when destabilized, has been shown to catalyze an enhancement of turbulent transport in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator [1, 2]. Simplifying the energy dependence of key resonant quantities allows for an analytical treatment of this KBM using the physics-based ordering from the more general equations of Tang, Connor, and Hastie [3]. Results are then compared with high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations for the (st)KBM in W7-X and the conventional KBM in a circular tokamak at both high and low magnetic shear, where good agreement is obtained in all cases. This reduced KBM model provides deeper insight into (sub-threshold) KBMs and their relationship with geometry, and shows promise for aiding in transport model development and geometry-based turbulence optimization efforts going forward.

However, up to now, the experimental exploration of this effect remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the experimental observation of the quantum boomerang effect of light. Our experiment is based on a one-dimensional disordered photonic lattice, which is composed of on-chip optical waveguides with engineered on-site random potential. We first characterize this optical disordered system by demonstrating the static Anderson localization of light beams. Next, through launching a kinetic light beam into the system, we observe that the light beam first moves away from its starting point, arrives at a maximum value, reverses its direction, and returns to its original position over time, confirming the observation of the quantum boomerang effect of light. Surprisingly, we find that optical loss, usually considered to be detrimental to optical experiments, can enhance the quantum boomerang effect by accelerating the light back to its original position. Our work provides new insights into the light-matter interactions in disordered medium and opens an avenue for future study of this phenomenon in nonlinear and many-photon contexts.         ",

When the frequencies of optical photons, magnons, phonons, and microwave photons resonance, the conversion efficiency can be made close to reach 98.76$\\%$ by adjusting the defined complex cooperativities, while in the case of Markovian, the conversion efficiency is 90.44$\\%$. By controlling the environmental spectral widths, the efficiency of frequency conversion exhibits a transition from Markovian regimes to non-Markovian regimes. This transformation simultaneously improves frequency conversion efficiency and conversion bandwidth, which is due to the excitation backflow generated by the interaction between the system and the non-Markovian environments. In the case, when the optical pump power in the non-Markovian regimes are of a large order of magnitude, the conversion bandwidth can be increased, but at the cost of reduced conversion efficiency. Our scheme improves the frequency conversion efficiency and bandwidth between optical photons and microwave photons, breaking the limitations of frequency conversion in Markovian environments and providing a new approach for long-distance quantum communication research of other non-Markovian quantum systems in quantum optics.

By rotating the resonators, input light from opposite directions induces opposite Sagnac-Fizeau shifts. These shifts result in the emergence or absence of quantum destructive interference in two-photon excitation processes. Specifically, when destructive quantum interference occurs, photons from one input direction are simultaneously blocked in both resonators, whereas the absence of complete destructive quantum interference causes the blockade effect to vanish for inputs from the opposite direction. We analytically give the optimal parameter conditions to achieve simultaneous strong photon blockade with the parametric amplification. By adjusting the Sagnac-Fizeau shifts, we can make mode a nonreciprocal photon blockade, while mode b exhibits photon blockade in both directions. This work lays a theoretical foundation for the development of multimode simultaneous nonreciprocal unconventional single-photon devices, which hold promising potential in multichannel topological optics and chiral quantum technologies.

Unfolding is viewed as a procedure for estimating an unknown probability density function. Both external and internal quality assessment methods can be applied for this purpose. In some cases, external criteria exist to evaluate deconvolution quality. A typical example is the deconvolution of a blurred image, where the sharpness of the restored image serves as an indicator of quality. However, defining such external criteria can be challenging, particularly when a measurement has not been performed previously. In such instances, internal criteria are necessary to assess the quality of the result independently of external information. The article discusses two internal criteria: MISE for the unfolded distribution and the condition number of the correlation matrix of the unfolded distribution. These internal quality criteria are applied to a comparative analysis of the two methods using identical numerical data. The results of the analysis demonstrate the superiority of the Data Unfolding method with MISE optimization over the Richardson-Lucy method.         ",

In this work, we investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of a three-level giant atom coupling with a semi-infinite photonic waveguide through multiple coupling points and driven by a classical driving field. We derive the analytical expressions for the probability amplitudes of the driven three-level giant atom and obtain two independent conditions. We find two different types of bound states (including the static bound states and the periodic equal-amplitude oscillating bound states) and discuss the physical origins of the bound states formation. Moreover, we discuss the case of the driven three-level giant atom interacting with the infinite photonic waveguide, where there is only one purely imaginary solution (i.e., only one bound state condition exists) for its complex frequency (coming from the absence of mirror at one end of the waveguide) compared to that of a driven three-level giant atom coupling with a semi-infinite photonic waveguide. With this, we also find two different types of bound states, including the static bound state and the periodic equal-amplitude oscillating bound states. Finally, the above results are generalized to a more general model involving a semi-infinite photonic waveguide coupling with an arbitrary number of noninteracting three-level giant atoms driven by the driving fields.

Moreover, non-reciprocal elements such as optical diodes and circulators are difficult to implement in photonics, as they typically require time-dependent perturbations, nonlinear effects, or external magnetic fields. This presents a significant barrier to the development of efficient, compact photonic technologies. We introduce the concept of optical spin current, wherein spin angular momentum is transferred by an electromagnetic field without accompanying energy transfer. This phenomenon is analogous to electron spin currents, where spin is decoupled from charge flow. Building on this principle, we propose optical spin diode and circulator -- devices that enable unidirectional propagation of spin currents while maintaining bidirectional energy flow, thus preserving reciprocity. Furthermore, we demonstrate asymmetric spin transfer between quantum dots mediated by the optical spin diode, highlighting the potential for novel optical spintronic functionalities.

In QR$^2$-code, the energy dispersions of electron and phonon are taken from Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) code, and the electron-phonon matrix element is obtained from the electron-phonon Wannier (EPW) code.

    "abstract": "           Optical cavities can be used to enhance the interaction of light with atoms or molecules. In a regime where cavity resonances are very far from the atomic or molecular transition frequencies, photon absorption can be neglected and the dispersive part of the interaction can induce spectacular phenomena such as squeezing, cooling, and self-organization. So far, this dispersive interaction regime has only been explored using a single or few longitudinal cavity modes at a time. We experimentally study the dispersive interaction between a cold atom cloud and many longitudinal modes of a Fabry-Perot cavity, by detecting collective light shifts in the transmission spectrum of an optical frequency comb probe. Notably, using a high quality resonator coupled to more than $10^5$ intracavity atoms, we detect appreciable shifts of $\\sim 100$ cavity modes simultaneously. These results constitute a direct demonstration of dispersive coupling of matter with many longitudinal modes of a linear resonator, and pave the way towards deeper exploration of atom-light dynamics in the multifrequency domain.

Here, we present a spectral quantum algorithm for scalar mixing by solving the advection-diffusion equation in a quantum computational fluid dynamics framework. We derive exact gate decompositions of the advection and diffusion operators in spectral space. For all but the simplest one-dimensional flows, these operators do not commute. Therefore, we use operator splitting and construct quantum circuits capable of simulating arbitrary polynomial velocity profiles, such as the Blasius profile of a laminar boundary layer. Periodic, Neumann, and Dirichlet boundary conditions can be imposed with the appropriate quantum spectral transform plus additional constraints on the Fourier expansion. We evaluate our approach in statevector simulations of a Couette flow, plane Poiseuille flow, and a polynomial Blasius profile approximation to demonstrate its potential and versatility for scalar mixing in shear flows. The number of gates grows with, at most, the cubed logarithm of the number of grid points. This evaluation shows that spectral accuracy allows comparably large time steps even though the operator splitting limits the temporal order.         ",

    "abstract": "           We theoretically explore strategies to actively control photon emission from quantum light sources by leveraging the large magneto-optical response of graphene. The quantum electrodynamic response of graphene -- characterized by the Purcell factor and the Lamb shift of a proximal emitter -- is analyzed for extended two-dimensional sheets, one-dimensional nanoribbons, and zero-dimensional nanodisks, all of which are endowed with an intrinsic chiral near-field response under a static perpendicular magnetic field. Using rigorous semianalytical models of these systems, we reveal that the emission properties can be readily tuned by variations in doping charge carrier density and applied magnetic field strength, both with respect to magnetoplasmon resonances (at infrared frequencies) and Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations (entering telecommunication bands) associated with optical transitions between discrete Landau levels. Localized magnetoplasmons in graphene nanoribbons are predicted to induce large dissymmetry in the spontaneous emission from left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized transitions in a proximal quantum emitter, presenting applications for chiral quantum optical waveguiding. This chiral dissymmetry is further enhanced in gyrotropic graphene nanodisks, signaling that the spatial shaping of near-fields in nanostructured graphene can significantly boost the intrinsic chiral response induced by the magnetic field. These results indicate that magneto-optical graphene constitutes a versatile and highly tunable platform for quantum light generation and manipulation at the nanoscale.         ",

To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to improve gastrointestinal imaging.

    "abstract": "           Quantum diamond microscopy (QDM), which employs nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles, is a promising approach to quantitatively imaging magnetic fields with both high resolution that approaches the diffraction limit and a wide field of view. The commonly adopted setups of QDM capture the photoluminescence through transparent diamonds, which inevitably entail aberrations -- optical errors that degrade the optical resolution and contrast of the obtainable image. In this study, we delve into the impact of optical aberrations, focusing on their dependence on diamond thickness. We first introduce a rigorous model [Richards et al., Braat et al.] of diffraction that incorporates aberrations, producing the NV center optical image. We confirm that this model accurately reproduces the confocal images of single NV centers obtained at various depths in diamonds. Extending this model to a wide-field microscope, we find that the model also accurately reproduces the USAF 1951 resolution test chart obtained through diamonds of various thicknesses. Based on these investigations, we quantitatively assess the consequent resolution constraints and propose thinning the diamond as a viable solution. We present a robust method to quantitatively ascertain resolution in optical systems influenced by aberrations caused by ray transmission through diamonds. For instance, for a typical microscope with an objective lens of NA = 0.7, the diffraction limit is achievable through diamonds that are 30 {\\mu}m thick, and a resolution of 1 {\\mu}m is obtained through diamonds that are 100 {\\mu}m thick. Those results opens up avenues for enhanced performance in QDM. The Julia package used to calculate the vectorial PSFs is available at this http URL.         ",

Fortunately, cooling schemes based on immersion technology or microfluidic networks are proving effective. However, further progress ultimately requires tackling the intrinsic thermal impedance caused by the discontinuity in properties across the liquid/solid (L/S) interface. Since experimental tools still lack sufficient spatiotemporal resolution for this purpose and given there are no analytic models for phonon propagation across the L/S interface, researchers have come to rely heavily on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. The goal of this computational study was to determine whether there exist compact general equations for the thermal slip length based on correlated behavior in the L/S contact zone. The results reveal power law equations for the thermal slip length incorporating the influence of molecular interaction parameters, local temperature, long range translational order and peak vibrational frequencies. These findings offer a promising route forward directed at the influence of surface localized phonons in the L/S contact zone.         ",

This asymmetry in the pixel response, enhanced by the 35 um pixel pitch - larger than in other prototypes - and certain features of the readout circuit, has not been observed in prototypes with smaller pixel pitches in this technology.

The elliptical STOVs differ from standard STOVs in an additional spatial chirp that is manifested as a wave front temporal rotation, and results in an enhanced transverse orbital angular momentum. The longitudinal field is significantly larger than that of normal STOVs, and may also take the form of an elliptical STOV.

We introduce distinct continuous quantum heat engines that utilize coherent heat transfer with baths, yielding genuine quantum enhancement in performance. These coherent engines consist of one qutrit system and two photonic baths and enable coherent heat transfer via two-photon transitions involving three-body interactions between the system and hot and cold baths. We demonstrate that coherent engines deliver significantly higher power output with much greater reliability, i.e., lower signal-to-noise ratio of the power, by hundreds of folds over their incoherent counterparts. Importantly, coherent engines can operate close to or at the maximal achievable reliability allowed by the quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Moreover, coherent engines manifest more nonclassical features than incoherent engines because they violate the classical thermodynamic uncertainty relation by a greater amount and for a wider range of parameters. These genuine enhancements in the performance of coherent engines are directly attributed to their capacity to harness higher energetic coherence for the resonant driving case. The experimental feasibility of coherent engines and the improved understanding of how quantum properties can enhance performance may find applications in quantum-enabled technologies.         ",

    "abstract": "           Cavity modulation of interacting molecular vibrational modes promises an expanded role of the characteristic vibrations to act as spectroscopic markers. In addition to the intrinsic, inter-mode and extrinsic, cavity-mediated inter-mode delocalization, the vibrational modes undergo multiscale relaxation due to reservoir vibrations. Two complementary coherent multidimensional spectroscopic techniques are presented, which reveal the dynamical nature of the mode correlations in the presence relaxation. Simulations are presented for finite laser pulses. The chosen cavity-vibron mode coupling strengths fall within the range of inter-vibrational mode coupling, hinting at a parameter regime where vibrational energy dispersal can be controlled. It is highlighted that the cavity manipulation of vibrational double excitations, namely, overtone and combination states, can offer deeper insights into the collective mode dynamics. These observations set the ground for cavity-controlled spectroscopic investigation of mode-selective dynamics, where localized electromagnetic modes function as an effective few-body coupler of vibrations.
