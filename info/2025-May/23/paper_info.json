    "abstract": "           We report high nuclear polarization of 1.2 mbar 3He gas in a sealed cell in magnetic fields up to 5 T using Metastability Exchange Optical Pumping (MEOP). The creation of a highly polarized 3He gas target for use in the 5 T field of Jefferson Lab's CLAS12 spectrometer would enable new studies of spin-dependent asymmetries on the neutron. A systematic study was conducted to evaluate the effects of discharge intensity, pump laser power, and optical pumping transition schemes on nuclear polarization and pumping rates. Steady-state polarizations up to 86 % in magnetic fields between 2 and 5 T were achieved, with a discharge-on relaxation time of 898 s at 5 T. These results underscore the potential of MEOP for high-field applications in nuclear physics experiments.         ",

    "title": "Spontaneous generation of athermal phonons bursts within bulk silicon causing excess noise, low energy background events and quasiparticle poisoning in superconducting sensors",
    "abstract": "           Solid state phonon detectors used in the search for dark matter or coherent neutrino nucleus interactions (CE$\\nu$NS) require excellent energy resolution (eV-scale or below) and low backgrounds to meet their science objectives. Unfortunately, an unknown source of phonon bursts (the low energy excess, or ``LEE'') both dominates all other above threshold background sources and produces shot noise from sub-threshold bursts which greatly exceeds all fundamental noise sources. In this paper, we measure these phonon bursts for 12 days after cool down in two nearly identical multi-phonon sensor channel 1cm$^2$ silicon detectors which differ only in the thickness of their substrate (1 mm vs 4 mm thick). We find that both the correlated shot noise and near threshold shared LEE relax with time since cooldown. Additionally, we show that both shot noise and LEE rates scale linearly with substrate thickness. When combined with previous measurements of other silicon phonon detectors with different substrate geometries and mechanical support strategies, these measurements strongly suggest that the dominant source of both above and below threshold LEE is the bulk substrate. By monitoring the relation between bias power and excess phonon shot noise we estimate that $\\varepsilon = \\frac{<E^2>}{<E>}$ for sub-threshold noise events is $0.68 \\pm 0.38$ meV. In our final dataset, we report a world-leading energy resolution of 258.5$\\pm$0.4 meV in the 1mm thick detector. Simple calculations suggest that these Si substrate phonon bursts are likely the dominant source of quasi-particle poisoning in superconducting qubits and sensors that are operated in well shielded and vibration free environments.

The first-principles elucidation and prediction of its rotation-torsional-vibrational motions are enabled in this work by the computation of a full-dimensional, \\emph{ab initio} potential energy surface (PES) and numerically exact quantum dynamics. An active-learning approach is used to sample explicitly correlated coupled-cluster electronic energies, and the datapoints are fitted with permutationally invariant polynomials to obtain a spectroscopic-quality PES representation. Variational vibrational energies and corresponding tunnelling splittings are computed up to the first overtone of the C-O stretching mode by direct numerical solution of the (ro)vibrational Schr\u00f6dinger equation with optimal internal coordinates and efficient basis and grid truncation techniques. As a result, the computed vibrational band origins finally agree with experiment within $5\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, allowing for the exploration of the large-amplitude quantum mechanical motion and tunnelling splittings coupled with the small-amplitude vibrational dynamics. These developments open the route towards simulating rovibrational spectra used to probe methanol in outer space and in precision science laboratories, as well as for probing interactions with external magnetic fields.

    "abstract": "           The advent of spatiotemporal wave packets (STWPs), represented by spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs), has paved the way for the exploration in optics and photonics. To date, despite considerable efforts, a comprehensive and efficient practical means to characterizing wave packets with such complex structures is still lacking. In this study, we introduced a new method designed to achieve high-precision and high-throughput spatiotemporal wave packet measurements using a user-friendly set up. This method is based on a quadriwave lateral shearing interferometric wavefront sensor that utilizes wavelength division multiplexing, termed the \"spatiotemporal wavefront sensor (STWFS).\" Using this method, we have fabricated a compact prototype with 295 * 295 spatial pixels * 36 wavelength channels of 0.5 nm spectral resolution in a single frame. This STWFS enabled, for the first time, single-shot self-referenced spatiotemporal three-dimensional (3D) optical field characterizations of STOV pulses with transverse orbital angular momenta L of 1 and 2, and obtained the dynamic visualization of the focused propagation of STOV pulses. Furthermore, the STWFS provides a 1.87 nm (0.95%) root mean square (RMS) absolute accuracy for spatiotemporal phase reconstruction. This achievement represents the highest performance compared with other three-dimensional spatiotemporal metrology methods. As a spatiotemporal optical field characterization method, the STWFS offers ultrafast 3D diagnostics, contributing to spatiotemporal photonics and broader applications across different fields, such as light-matter interactions and optical communications.

In this paper we consider the governance of quantum internet, a new type of communication network developed for the promise that it can deliver inherently secure communication solely through its technical design. This paper gives a general analysis of the functions quantum internet offer, and then challenges this proposition by arguing that trust, an essential precondition for users to adopt this technology, cannot be guaranteed by technical features alone. Instead, trust is fundamentally a social phenomenon, shaped by how quantum internet is governed, operated, and regulated. Therefore, the ultimate success of quantum internet in fulfilling its promise of secure communication will depend not just on its technical hardware and software but also on the policies and frameworks for running these capacities, and on the public trust in those policies and frameworks. With this argument we arrive at recommendations to decision-makers for developing quantum internet and its governance in a way that quantum internet that can be trusted for its promised capacities.

We observe measurement resolution at the nanometer (attosecond) scale with only $O(10^4)$ photon pairs, despite the presence of background and loss.

    "abstract": "           Phases of matter are conventionally distinguished from one another by local observables. Topological quantum phases lie outside this paradigm; their differences can only be learned by examining them globally. This has striking implications for the stability of these phases, their classification, and the phase transitions between them. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate these implications using interacting magnetic erbium atoms in an optical lattice. We show that a Mott insulator and a pinned charge-density wave in one dimension are in distinct crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases (CSPTs). The quantum phase transition separating them is revealed by measuring nonlocal string order parameters using site-resolved imaging. Remarkably, stacking two copies of these states eliminates the critical point -- a signature feature of topological phases that underlies their classification. Moreover, we show that while a programmable symmetry-breaking disorder pattern can also remove this critical point, averaging over disorder restores it, supporting recent theoretical predictions of mixed-state order. Finally, we highlight a connection between one of these CSPTs and the Haldane insulator, and detect signatures of the transition between the Haldane and the Mott insulator. Our results establish a path toward probing broader symmetry-protected topology and mixed-state order in programmable quantum devices.         ",

However, all well-known photonic platforms have excessively high losses in the UV, which has prevented photonic integrated circuits (PICs) being used to address these and other important application spaces. Photonic waveguides using low-loss alumina cores have emerged as a promising solution because of almunia's large optical bandgap and the high quality of films enabled by atomic layer deposition. However, to the best of our knowledge, active alumina PICs have only been realized using thermo-optic tuning, which precludes switching speeds shorter than one microsecond, high circuit densities, and cryogenically compatible operation. Here, we introduce a CMOS-fabricated, piezo-optomechanical PIC platform using alumina waveguides with low optical losses at UV wavelengths and aluminum nitride piezoelectric strain actuators, which solves the issues associated with thermal tuning. We demonstrate a high-performance, reconfigurable optical filter operating at wavelengths as low as 320 nm.

    "abstract": "           Unidirectional propagation based on surface magnetoplasmons (SMPs) has recently been realized at the interface of magnetized semiconductors. However, usually SMPs lose their unidirectionality due to non-local effects, especially in the lower trivial bandgap of such structures. More recently, a truly unidirectional SMP (USMP) has been demonstrated in the upper topological non-trivial bandgap, but it supports only a single USMP, limiting its functionality. In this work, we present a fundamental physical model for multiple, robust, truly topological USMP modes at terahertz (THz) frequencies, realized in a semiconductor-dielectric-semiconductor (SDS) slab waveguide under opposing external magnetic fields. We analytically derive the dispersion properties of the SMPs and perform numerical analysis in both local and non-local models. Our results show that the SDS waveguide supports two truly (even and odd) USMP modes in the upper topological non-trivial bandgap. Exploiting these two modes, we demonstrate unidirectional SMP multimode interference (USMMI), being highly robust and immune to backscattering, overcoming the back-reflection issue in conventional bidirectional waveguides. To demonstrate the usefullness of this approach, we numerically realize a frequency- and magnetically-tunable arbitrary-ratio splitter based on this robust USMMI, enabling multimode conversion. We, further, identify a unique index-near-zero (INZ) odd USMP mode in the SDS waveguide, distinct from conventional semiconductor-dielectric-metal waveguides. Leveraging this INZ mode, we achieve phase modulation with a phase shift from -$\\pi$ to $\\pi$. Our work expands the manipulation of topological waves and enriches the field of truly non-reciprocal topological physics for practical device applications.         ",

Increased secondary electron emission from the material has ramifications for the degradation and erosion of the wall. Results shows that the oxidation leads to an increased electron flux into the wall, and a reduced ion flux. The net transfer of energy to the surface is significantly greater for the oxidized case than for the pure lithium case.

Our formulation leverages a complex scalar potential along with an appropriately constructed Lagrangian energy density. Importantly, we show that polarization inhomogeneities can be included by simple addition of a spatially dependent polarization angle to the complex potential phase. Thus, phase and polarization are seen to be equivalent from an energy perspective. As part of our development, we also show how the complex scalar potential arises naturally when considering polarization angle as a field symmetry during construction of the Lagrangian. We further show that the definition of linear momentum density in terms of the complex potential holds a distinct advantage over the conventional definition for inhomogeneously polarized beams.

    "abstract": "           Dual-band plasmonic nanoantennas, exhibiting two widely separated user-defined resonances, are fundamental building blocks for the investigation and optimization of plasmon-enhanced optical phenomena, including photoluminescence, Raman scattering, and various nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation or sum-frequency generation, parametric down-conversion, etc. The nanoparticle-on-slit (NPoS) or nanoparticle-in-groove (NPiG) is a recently proposed dual-band antenna with independently tunable resonances at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths. It was used to enhance the corresponding sum- and difference-frequency generation processes from optimally located molecules by an estimated $10^{13}$-fold. However, the theoretical understanding of such structures and their eigenmodes remains poor, hindering further optimization and limiting broader applications. Here, we explore a diverse range of nanocavity-like quasi-normal modes (QNMs) supported by NPoS structures, examining the contributions of both their near-field (i.e., giant photonic density of states) and far-field (i.e., spatial radiation patterns) characteristics to frequency upconversion. We identify methods for independently tuning the visible and mid-infrared resonances while conserving a good mode overlap in the near field, which is essential for efficient nonlinear processes. Moreover, through mode analysis, we unveil an experimentally unexplored fundamental resonance with greater field enhancement and much-improved mode overlap with the mid-infrared field, which could, in principle, further boost the mid-infrared upconversion efficiency by 5-fold compared to existing results. This work helps to rationalize and optimize the enhancement of nonlinear effects across a wide spectral range using a flexible and experimentally attractive nanoplasmonic platform.         ",

In this work, we introduce a large-scale, compact photonic neuron in which each microring performs modulation and weighting simultaneously.

In addition, we investigated a range of configurations for the proposed neuron to better tailor its behavior to various computational tasks. To illustrate the adaptability of the system's tasks, we explore both spatial and temporal domains, highlighting its versatility through two representative tasks: image processing and, for the first time, financial time series analysis, which represents a promising new frontier for neuromorphic photonics. These findings underscore the considerable promise of photonic computing in addressing a breadth of real-world challenges, particularly under escalating demands for both scalability and flexibility.

While numerous methods exist for generating SAWs, they each have intrinsic limitations that inhibit performance, operation at high frequencies, and use in systems constrained in size, weight, and power. Here, for the first time, we present a completely solid-state, single-chip SAW phonon laser that is comprised of a lithium niobate SAW resonator with an internal, DC electrically injected and broadband semiconductor gain medium with $<$0.15 mm$^2$ footprint. Below the threshold bias of 36 V, the device behaves as a resonant amplifier, and above it exhibits self-sustained coherent oscillation, linewidth narrowing, and high output powers. A continuous on-chip acoustic output power of up to -6.1 dBm is generated at 1 GHz with a resolution-limited linewidth of $<$77 Hz and a carrier phase noise of -57 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset. Through detailed modeling, we show pathways for improving these devices' performance including mHz linewidths, sub -100 dBc/Hz phase noise at 1 kHz, high power efficiency, footprints less than 550 um$^2$ at 10 GHz, and SAW generation approaching the hundreds of GHz regime. This demonstration provides a fundamentally new approach to SAW generation, paving the way toward ultra-high-frequency SAW sources on a chip and highly miniaturized and efficient SAW-based systems that can be operated without an external RF source.

    "abstract": "           Self-heterodyne techniques are widely used for laser phase noise characterization due to their simple experimental setup and the removed need for a reference laser. However, when investigating low-noise lasers, optical delay paths shorter than the laser coherence length become necessary. This introduces interference patterns that distort the measured phase noise spectrum. To compensate for this distortion, we introduce a robust data-driven digital signal processing routine that integrates a kernel-based regression model into a phase noise power spectral density (PN-PSD) equalization framework. Unlike conventional compensation methods that rely on simplified phase noise models, our approach automatically adapts to arbitrary laser lineshapes by using Kernel Ridge Regression with automatic hyperparameter optimization. This approach effectively removes the interference artifacts and provides accurate PN-PSD estimates. We demonstrate the method's accuracy and effectiveness through simulations and via experimental measurements of two distinct low-noise lasers. The method's applicability to a broad range of lasers, minimal hardware requirements, and improved accuracy make this approach ideal for improving routine phase noise characterizations.         ",

Diagonalizing a quantum state is a fundamental yet computationally challenging task in quantum information science, especially as the system size increases. To address this challenge, we reformulate the problem as a variational optimization process, where parameterized quantum circuits are trained to transform the input state into a diagonal form. To guide the optimization, we develop two objective functions based on measurement outcomes in the computational basis. The first objective function utilizes global computational basis probabilities, with the optimized value directly yielding the purity of the input state. The second objective function, designed for enhanced experimental feasibility, is constructed solely from single-qubit probabilities. It admits an elegant and compact analytical form that significantly reduces the exponential measurement complexity, while still effectively driving the state toward a diagonal representation. Through numerical simulations and analytical insights, we demonstrate that our variational optimization framework successfully produces the diagonal form of an input quantum state, offering a scalable and practical solution for quantum state diagonalization.

    "abstract": "           In this work, we begin by questioning the existence of a new kind of nonergodic extended phase, namely, the many-body critical (MBC) phase in finite systems of an interacting quasiperiodic system. We find that this phase can be separately detected from the other phases such as the many-body ergodic (ME) and many-body localized (MBL) phases in the model through supervised neural networks made for both binary and multi-class classification tasks, utilizing, rather un-preprocessed, eigenvalue spacings and eigenvector probability densities as input features. Moreover, the output of our trained neural networks can also indicate the critical points separating ME, MBC and MBL phases, which are consistent with the same obtained from other conventional methods. We also employ unsupervised learning techniques, particularly principal component analysis (PCA) of eigenvector probability densities to investigate how this framework, without any training, captures the, rather unknown, many-body phases (ME, MBL and MBC) and single particle phases (delocalized, localized and critical) of the interacting and non-interacting systems, respectively. Our findings reveal that PCA entropy serves as an effective indicator (order parameter) for detecting phase transitions in the single-particle systems. Moreover, this method proves applicable to many-body systems when the data undergoes a suitable pre-processing. Interestingly, when it comes to extraction of critical (correlation length) exponents through a finite size-scaling, we find that for single-particle systems, scaling collapse of neural network outputs is obtained using components of inverse participation ratio (IPR) as input data. Remarkably, we observe identical critical exponents as obtained from scaling collapse of the IPR directly for different single-particle phase transitions.         ",

    "abstract": "           Microwave cavities used in axion haloscope experiments typically employ a tuning rod as a means to widen the range of resonance frequencies at which it is sensitive to axion-to-photon conversion. A realistic tuning mechanism requires a gap between the cavity end caps and the tuning rod to ensure movement, and causes some modes to hybridize with the resonant mode that is being tracked for the experiment. These so-called mode mixings lead to gaps in the frequency range that practically lose sensitivity to axions. In order to solve this problem, we present a cavity design which, for two tuning rod configurations corresponding to a lower and higher frequency range, have a dielectric rod inserted at a specific location that makes the cavity asymmetrical. Moving the tuning rod closer to the dielectric insert changes the location and frequency of the mode mixing compared to when it is farther away from it. This design is easily realizable in practical experiments and makes possible an axion dark matter search with minimal loss in sensitivity due to mode mixings. We also show that the same design has the same desired effect when cavity dimensions are scaled down to be smaller and are at higher resonance frequencies.         ",
